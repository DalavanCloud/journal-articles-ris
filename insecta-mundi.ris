N2  - This study is a revision of the genus Phanaeus as defined by Edmonds (1972). The intro· duction includes a history of the genus, a key separating it from related genera, a discussion of taxonomic characters and primary type material, a summary of the biology and geography of the genus, and conclusions about its evolution. The systematic section treats 48 species and subspecies in two subgenera, one of which, Notiophanaeus, is new. Notiophanaeus comprises five species groups embracing 15 mostly South American species. Phanaeus, sen. str., includes 31 species and subspecies arranged in eight species groups. Keys separate subgenera, species groups, species, and subspecies. Phanaeus labreae (Pierce) and P. antiquus Horn, known from fossil deposits, are considered incertae sedis. One new subspecies is described, P. (P.) triangularis texensis. The following new combinations result from reductions in rank from species to subspecies: P. (P.) amethystinus guatemalensis Harold, P. (P.) tridens pseudofurcosus Balthasar, and P. (P.) wagneri pilatei Harold. Neotypes are designated for the following taxa: Copris triangularis Say, C. quadridens Say, Phanaeus tridens Laporte-Castelnau, P. demon Laporte-Castelnau, P. laevicollis LaPorte-Castelnau (= P. kirbyi Vigors), P. difformis LeConte, P. igneus Macleay, and P. vindex Macleay. Lectotypes are designated for the following (valid name, where appropriate, appears parenthetically preceded by =): Scarabaeus carnifex Linnaeus 1767, not 1758 (= P. vindex Macleay); P. minos Erichson (= P. meleagris Blanchard); P. bogotensis Kirsch (= P. hermes Harold); P. torrens LeConte (= P. triangularis [Say]); P. pyrois Bates; P. furiosus Bates; P. eximius Bates; P. beltianus Bates; P. scutifer Bates; P. excelsus Bates (= P. demon Laporte-Castelnau); P. obliquans Bates (= P. demon Laporte-Castelnau); P. scintillans Bates (= P. mexicanus Harold); and P. tepanensis Bates (= P. amethystinus guatemalensis Harold). The following new synonymy is proposed in Notiophanaeus (synonym precedes valid name): P. kirbyi truncaticornis Olsoufieff = P. kirbyi Vigors, P. blanchardi Olsoufieff = P. pyrois Bates, and P. funereus Balthasar = P. pyrois Bates. The following are new synonyms in Phanaeus, sen. str.: P. bogotensis Kirsch = P. hermes Harold, P. lugens N evinson = P. prasinus Harold, P. furcosus Felsche = P. furiosus Bates, P. herbeus Bates = P. daphnis Harold, P. coerulus Bates = P. daphnis Harold, P. tricornis Olsoufieff = P. daphnis Harold, P. niger Olsoufieff = P. triangularis (Say), P. obliquans Bates = P. demon LaporteCastelnau, P. obliquans Bates = P. demon Laporte-Castelnau, P. excelsus Bates = P. demon LaporteCastelnau, P. scintillans Bates = P. mexicanus Harold, P. martinezi Halffter = P. amethystinus Harold, P. quadridens borealis Olsoufieff = P. quadridens (Say), P. vindex rubervirens Robinson = P. vindex Macleay, P. floridanus Olsoufieff = P. igneus Macleay, and P. difformis magnificens Robinson = P. difformis LeConte. A list of all known available names and a previously established synonymy are included in the introduction. Geographical distribution data for all species and subspecies are contained in the appendix.  Este trabajo es una revision del genero Phanaeus Macleay, segiin Edmonds (1972). La parte introductoria consiste en una relacion de la historia taxonomica del genero, una clave que 10 separa de generos vecinos, un resumen de la biologia y geografia del grupo, y una serie de conclusiones acerca de su evolucion. La sec cion sistematica trata de 48 especies y subespecies colocadas en dos subgeneros, de los cuales N otiophanaeus es nuevo. N otiophanaeus comprende cinco grupos de especies, que, en su mayoria, son sudamericanas. Phanaeus, sen. str., consta de 31 especies y subespecies, principal mente mexicanas y estadounidenses, clasificadas en ocho grupos. Se presentan claves para la identificacion de subgeneros, grupos de especies, especies y subespecies. Phanaeus labreae (Pierce) y P. antiquus Horn son especies supuestamente extintas de incertae sedis. Los datos de distribucion geogriifica comprenden el apendice. Se describe una nueva subespecie, P. (P.) triangularis texensis. El nivel taxonomico de tres taxa, anteriormente consideradas como especies, se baja a subespecie. Se designan neotipos por ocho especies y lectotipos por otras trece. Se seiialan 19 casos de nueva sinonimia.

N2  - The purpose of this paper is to describe a new species of the scarabaeine dung beetle genus AnomiopusWestwood from the Junín region of east-central Peru. It is a contribution to an ongoing study ofthe Peruvian scarabaeine dung beetle fauna based at the Museo de Historia Natural de la UniversidadMayor de San Marcos in Lima. In a previous paper (Edmonds and Figueroa 2013) we described whatwe then regarded as the most bizarre Anomiopus yet discovered, A. pishtaco. Further fi eld studies tothe west of and at a higher elevation than the type locality of A. pishtaco has yielded yet another unusual,arguably even more bizarre species, A. apuskispay, new species, which we describe below. Thetaxonomy of Anomiopus is the subject of a series of recent papers by the late Virgínia Luzia Canhedo(Canhedo 2004a, 2004b, 2006). Nothing is known about the biology of this new species nor that of A.pishtaco. Most Anomiopus specimens with precise collecting data were attracted to light traps of varioustypes as well as fl ight-intercept traps, dung-baited pitfall traps, sweep nets, and direct capture nearnewly excavated nests of Acromyrmex Mayr (Hymenoptera; Formicidae).

N2  - Tiphallus torreon n. sp., the first rhachodesmid milliped from Coahuila, Mexico, displays an iridescent turquoise pigmentation with patterned white paranotal markings and a truncated, subapical projection from the broad, non-descript gonopodal acropodite. Four genera – Strongylodesmus Saussure, Mexidesmus Loomis, and Ceuthauxus and Tiphallus, both by Chamberlin – contain forms exhibiting this general condition, but the last is the only one whose type species does. Synthetic treatments are essential to advance familial knowledge beyond the descriptive stage, and revising these four taxa would constitute a meaningful initial study. Rhachodesmidae extend from northern Nuevo León, Mexico, ca. 77 km (48 mi) from the Rio Grande, to central Costa Rica; Glomeridae (Glomerida), Platydesmidae (Platydesmida), and Stemmiulidae (Stemmiulida) show similar distributions whereas Allopocockiidae (Spirobolida) and Rhysodesmus Cook (Polydesmida: Xystodesmidae) traverse the river and occupy southernmost Texas. Tridontomidae, the other component of Rhachodesmoidea, occupies a small enclave in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. Rhachodesmidae/oidea do not occur in Panama and are initially recorded from Belize; localities are needed from Honduras.

N2  - Erythemis Hagen, 1861 (Odonata: Libellulidae: Sympetrinae) is a Neotropical genus with ten species in which morphological characters vary widely. The aim of this paper is to study the taxonomic diversity of the genus Erythemis and to test the diagnostic value of morphological characters used to discriminate species. The diagnostic value of the morphometric characters is tested using discriminant function analysis, principal component analysis, and graphical exploration of the data. A total of 134 characters were studied; of those, 53 are recoded and 81 are proposed in this work. Discrete characters such as color, genitalia, ventral teeth of male cercus, extension of dark basal area in hind wing, and morphometric characters of abdominal carinae and antenodal wing venation are the most useful for species determination. In contrast, abdomen length/HW length ratio, vulvar lamina length, and spines of femoral structure are highly variable. A lectotype is designated for Diplax credula Hagen, 1861. Taxonomic keys for males and females are included, and variation in several characters is presented.

N2  - According to Monné (2015) and Bezark (2015) Trachyderini Dupont, 1836 is divided in two subtribes: Ancylocerina Thomson, 1864 (with seven genera); and Trachyderina Dupont, 1836 (with one hundred twenty-five genera). Monné (2015) listed one hundred twenty-two genera of Trachyderina in the Neotropical Region. Despite the great number of genera of Trachyderina, it was not possible to include the new species in any of them. Fragoso et al. (1987) separated the subtribes in a key: “Mesocoxal acetabula laterally closed; elytral surface strongly punctate, epipleura sinuous; scutellum small, often depressed; males with the border of sternite 8 projected latero-ventrally beyond the limits of corresponding tergite (verified in Ancylocera and Callancyla)”, conducting to Ancylocerina; and “Mesocoxal acetabula usually open laterally; body, scutellum, antennae and elytral surface highly variable; borders of sternite 8 not laterally projected”, conducting to Trachyderina. The shape of the border of the sternite 8, apparently, is variable in Ancylocerina. For example, it is not projected in males of Cercoptera banonii Spinola, 1839. As all other features listed to Ancylocerina are variable in Trachyderina, except for the border of sternite 8, they cannot be used to separate the subtribes. It is not the scope of this work to study the subtribes, but if the mesocoxal acetabula are “usually” open in Trachyderina, it can be inferred that they can be closed in some species. Monné and Napp (2000) commented: “Fragoso et al. (1987) established Ancylocerina Thomson (1864) as a subtribe of Trachyderini Dupont, basically by the shape of the brush on the eighth urosternite of the females, formed, as in the Trachyderina, by long-petiolate conchoidal, spatulate and acicular setae, arranged in several rows.” Monné and Napp (2000) did not describe sternite 8 in males of Ancylocerina, and did not give differences between the subtribes. We are assuming that all genera with mesocoxal cavities laterally closed belong to Ancylocerina and those that are open belong to Trachyderina. The new genus herein described belongs to the latter.

N2  - Seven specimens of Sybra alternans (Wiedemann) (Cerambycidae: Lamiinae: Apomecynini) were captured with a UV light trap and by beating branches of trees in the urban area of Easter Island (Chile) during 2011–2016, representing the fi rst record of the species in this Chilean insular territory, but not continental Chile. Sybra alternans is native to Southeast Asia and has been introduced accidentally to Hawaii and Florida in the United States of America. Data are presented from the literature on this species’ distribution, host plants, and biological information. Siete ejemplares de Sybra alternans (Wiedemann) (Cerambycidae: Lamiinae: Apomecynini) fueron capturados con una trampa de luz UV y mediante el sacudido de ramas de árboles en el área urbana de la Isla de Pascua (Chile) durante los años 2011-2016, representando el primer registro de la especie en este territorio insular chileno, no estando presente hasta ahora en el continente. A pesar de que S. alternans es una especie nativa del sudeste asiático, se ha introducido accidentalmente en Hawaii y Florida en los Estados Unidos. De acuerdo a lo señalado en la literatura, se entrega información sobre su distribución, plantas hospedantes y aspectos biológicos de la especie.

N2  - We clarify the taxonomy and nomenclature of several species-group names and the family-group name for the anticheirine scarabs (Scarabaeidae: Rutelinae: Rutelini), a group that includes nearly 550 species and subspecies in 44 genera and subgenera. These clarifications are necessary due to taxonomic and nomenclatural inaccuracies in recent revisionary works. We provide a list of genera included in the anticheirine scarabs sensu Soula. Numerous nomenclatural changes are necessary due to invalid type designations or misspellings: the valid type species of Aequatoria Arrow is Chlorota associata Waterhouse; the valid type species of Chlorota Burmeister is Rutela terminata Le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau and Audinet-Serville; the valid type species of Dorysthetus Blanchard is Macraspis chlorophana Burmeister; the valid type species of Anticheira Eschscholtz is Scarabaeus virens Drury. Changes to the type species of Anticheira result in new combinations: Anticheira virens virens (Drury), new combination , Anticheira virens bleuzeni (Soula), new combination and Anticheira virens jossi (Soula), new combination . Some anticheirine species names were not associated with species descriptions or type designations, making these names nomina nuda and unavailable : “Chlorota smithi”, “Macraspis cincta guatemalensis”, “Parachlorota equatoriana”, “Parachlorota pardoi”, “Pseudothyridium (Megathyridium) bousqueti”, “Theuremaripa rivae brasiliensis” and “Thyridium cupriventre blanchardi” . Dorysthaetus rufipennis Dejean is a nomen nudum and an unavailable name . We correct numerous misspellings from Soula’s five volumes on anticheirine scarabs and provide a list to avoid propagation of these errors by future researchers. Eighteen names are unavailable infrasubspecifi c names, and thirty-six of Soula’s names were misspelled. These names confuse and obscure ruteline systematics. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive list of infrasubspecific names in the anticheirine scarabs and we establish these as available or unavailable names .

N2  - At Topes de Collantes Natural Park, Alturas de Trinidad, in the mountains of Guamuhaya province of Sancti Spiritus, Cuba, 30 species of scale insects belonging to 21 genera, four families and an endemic species were identifi ed. Specimens were deposited at the insect zoological collection of the Ecology and Systematics Institute (CZACC), Cuba. A literature review was carried out and the world data base on scale insects, ScaleNet was consulted. A cartographic map indicating the collecting sites at the scale of 1: 250,000 was created using MapInfo Professional Version 4.5 program. Twelve species are recorded for the fi rst time for the mountains of Guamuhaya and further 10 species are recorded for other locations. 82% of the species were polyphagous, 11% were oligophagous and 7% were monophagous. 57% were introduced species, 43% were native and 79% are cosmopolitan or widely distributed species. 30 species and 21 families of host plants were identifi ed, of which 23 plant species were new host plant records for 19 scale insect species, and 11 botanical families are for the fi rst time recorded as hosts for 10 scale insect species. There were significant differences in the distribution of scale insects and their host plant species, botanical families and vegetation type.

N2  - The Colombian fluted scale (CFS), Crypticerya multicicatrices Kondo & Unruh (Hemiptera: Monophlebidae) is a polyphagous scale insect which affects about 100 species of plants. Between 2010–2013, the species was reported as an invasive pest on the islands of San Andres and Old Providence, Colombian territory in the Caribbean sea. Currently, populations of the CFS also have increased in the city of Cali, Valle del Cauca State, mainland Colombia, affecting different host plants, especially leguminous trees such as Caesalpinia peltophoroides Benth., Pithecellobium dulce (Roxb.) Benth., P. saman (Jacq.) Benth. (Fabaceae) and mango, Mangifera indica L. (Anacardiaceae). With the aim of searching for natural enemies to control the CFS, field studies were conducted in the city of Cali between February 2013 and October 2014. As a result of this study, two species of lady beetles were found feeding on CFS, i.e., Anovia punica Gordon and Rodolia cardinalis (Mulsant) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). This is the first record of R. cardinalis preying on CFS.

N2  - Recent shifts in US policies towards Cuba suggest a relaxation or lifting of the embargo may occur in the near future. With the prospects of open travel and trade with Cuba come concerns over the introduction of agricultural pests. In an effort to assess these concerns the distribution-based introduction risk of pests listed in the 2015 Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey’s (CAPS) list of priority pests of economic and environmental importance is reviewed. Of the 59 pests on the CAPS priority pest list, 20 have been recorded in the literature as being present in the Caribbean Basin, South America and Central America. For these 20 New World pests a commodity and distribution-based risk rating was assigned to describe their potential for introduction through the Cuba-Florida pest pathway. The highest rating was given to the six listed pests currently reported as being present in Cuba, and potential for introduction and subsequent impact of these six pests on Florida agriculture is discussed. In addition to the pests found on the 2015 CAPS priority pest list, information regarding pests of concern in the family Tephritidae and the Old World bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), is also included, as is a description of the Cuban plant health and regulatory structure. The significance of plant-pest introductions between Cuba and Florida is discussed, with an emphasis on proactive engagement in research and collaboration to address these issues.

The following formerly suppressed species are herein reinstated: Olidiana (Lodiana) flavofasciana Li, 1989, Olidiana (Lodiana) nigritibiana Li, 1987, Olidiana rufofasciana Li and Wang, 1989 and Webbolidia (Taharana) uniaristata Zhang, 1990. The following 3 species are new junior synonyms: Calodia flavinota Cai and Kuoh, 1993: 220 [= Calodia patricia (Jacobi), 1944: 49], Olidiana yangi McKamey 2006: 502 [= Lodiana (Olidiana) hamularis Xu, 2000: 220] and Taharana yinggenensis Zhang and Zhang, 1994: 96 [= Taharana (Coelidia) sparsa (Stål) 1854: 254]. Taharana hainana Zhang 1994: 132 is a nomen nudum based on the same name in Zhang’s thesis (1988) which name was cited later by Li and Wang 1991: 275. Lodiana hainana Cai and He 2002: 139 is also a nomen nudum. A replacement name proposed herein is caii, nom. nov. in the genus Olidiana; Zhang’s 1994: 71 illustrations of subgenital plate (I) and aedeagus (M) of “fasciana Li” does not appear to represent the respective illustrations in Li 1991: 357 and may represent a new species in the genus Glaberana. The name of Olidiana nigridorsum (Cai and Shen) is changed to Olidiana nigridorsa (Cai and Shen) to agree with gender. Among 12 genera, 102 species are proposed in new combinations. Lodiana reductusi Xu and Kuoh, 1997 and Lodiana spicata Xu and Kuoh, 1997 are declared incertae sedis after attempts failed to locate the original descriptions and type specimens. Both species are provisionally assigned to the genus Olidiana. Two syntype specimens of Jassus egregius Schumacher, previously thought to be lost, were located in the Senckenberg Deutsches Entomologisches Institut, Müncheberg, Germany. The male specimen is designated lectotype herein. Six species in the Olidiana brevis (Walker) interspecific variation complex are elucidated with illustrations of male genitalia features. New records, an updated checklist and a synoptic catalogue are also provided. All taxa including 264 valid species and 304 names are indexed.

N2  - Mimuloria Chamberlin 1928 is revived from synonymy under Nannaria Chamberlin 1918a for Nannariini (Polydesmida: Xystodesmidae) with simple but apically ornamented gonopodal acropodites that arch or lean mediad and cross body midlines and opposing acropodites in situ. It encompasses two assemblages based primarily on the nature of the ornamentations, the castanea and dilatata species groups. The former includes three established species [M. castanea (McNeill 1887) M. missouriensis Chamberlin 1928 and M. davidcauseyi (Causey 1950a)], and the latter contains two new ones (M. dilatata [M. d. dilatata, M. d. sigmoidea], and M. rhysodesmoides). Castanaria Causey 1950b is returned to synonymy under Mimuloria, and C. depalmai Causey 1950b is placed under M. castanea, thereby constituting a new synonymy. The fi rst illustrations of the holotype gonopods of Fontaria oblonga C. L. Koch 1847 and N. minor Chamberlin 1918a unequivocally establish their identities, and the convoluted nomenclatural tangle involving Oenomaea Hoffman 1964 and O. pulchella (Bollman 1889a) is detailed. Whether in Oenomaea or a new genus, separate generic status seems appropriate for Nannariini with subterminal solenomeres; N. morrisoni Hoffman 1948 and its potential synonym N. shenandoa Hoffman 1949 may also belong here. Initial tribal localities are reported from Alabama, South Carolina, and coastal Virginia and Maryland, and “O. pulchella” occurs in northern Alabama north/west of the Tennessee River; M. castanea is newly recorded from Missouri and Tennessee. A horizontally subtriangular distribution in the eastern and midwestern states is projected for Nannariini, which even occur on South Bass Island, Ohio, in Lake Erie, and may thus inhabit nearby Pelee Island, Ontario, Canada.

N2  - The name Melolontha hypocrita Mannerheim, 1829 has been long unused, even though it is the type species of Hyporhiza Dejean, 1833. I examined the only known specimen from the type series and here designate it as the lectotype. Examination of this lectotype reveals that this species is best placed in the genus Rhinaspis Perty, 1830. Consequently, the genus Hyporhiza Dejean, 1833 is confi rmed as a junior synonym of Rhinaspis. Further, the replacement name Rhinaspis fuhrmanni is proposed for Rhinaspis hypocrita (Blanchard, 1850), a new secondary homonym of Rhinaspis hypocrita (Mannerheim, 1829). A homonymy problem was also discovered and corrected for the genus Plectris LePeletier and Serville, 1828. The replacement name Plectris schoolmeestersi is proposed for Plectris paraguayensis Moser, 1924, which is a secondary junior homonym of Plectris paraguayensis (Moser, 1921).

N2  - Characterized by small body size, apically rounded/lobed anterior gonopod telopodites, long slender posterior gonopod telopodites, and torsion in the cyphopod receptacles, Floridobolus fl oydi, n. sp., is described from the southern sector of the Brooksville Ridge in northwestern peninsular Florida. It inhabits sandy “Big Scrub” environments like F. penneri Causey, 1957, and F. orini Shelley, 2014, and is documented from the sector’s center and northern periphery, in Hernando and Citrus Counties, respectively, with a sight record from the eastern periphery. Its discovery supports the thesis that each sand ridge in peninsular Florida may harbor a unique species of this endemic genus.

N2  - The fauna of Panama is species-rich due to its location and topography, and the resulting diversity of microclimates and habitats. The last summary of information about the caddisfly fauna (Insecta: Trichoptera) of Panama in 1992 noted 168 taxa in 13 families and 39 genera. Since then, and through 2014, a large number of publications, based on work by a dedicated cadre of individuals, have recorded a net gain of 78 species and six genera. In 2015, 17 new species to science and 38 new country records were added, including one new family and two new genera for the country; and, two species were removed. Thus, 299 species of caddisflies are now known from the Republic of Panama and are distributed among 14 families and 47 genera. Given the higher diversity in neighboring Costa Rica (&gt;500 species), we feel certain that there are many more species yet to be discovered.

N2  - Ichneumonidae are incredibly diverse, yet there have been few Guatemalan ichneumonid studies. We studied the phenology of 215 specimens of Zagryphus zulaya Gauld (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae: Tryphoninae), most captured in a light trap and two Malaise traps in a montane (1850m) forest from 2002 to 2014. One of the Malaise traps caught over 95% of the specimens. The results suggest that Z. zulaya is most abundant in May, June, July, and August, the rainy season. Zagryphus vegai Gauld is newly recorded from Guatemala; it was previously known only from Costa Rica. It was found at an altitude of 1850m, though its previous known range was 700m to 1500m.

N2  - Cedar Point Biological Station (CPBS) is located in the mixed grass prairie of the central Great Plains, at the transition between the subregions known as the “tall grass” and “short grass” prairies. Adding to the habitat diversity, there are wetlands and riparian habitats associated with the North Platte River and the edge of the Sandhills region of north central Nebraska. This concurrence of habitats supports a diverse small mammal community. The purpose of this paper is to assemble all published information on ectoparasites associated with small mammals (Insectivora, Rodentia) of southwestern Nebraska, and to report the results of an intensive survey carried out by students of the Parasitology fi eld course during two summers at CPBS. In 2012 and 2013, 27 species of mammal-associated arthropods were collected, including fi ve species of sucking lice (Anoplura), a chewing louse (Ischnocera), six species of fl eas (Siphonaptera), thirteen species of mesostigmatic mites (Laelapidae, Macronyssidae, Macrochelidae), and two species of metastigmatic ticks (Ixodidae). These specimens were brushed from the pelage of 11 species of small mammals that were captured in a variety of habitats around CPBS. The arthropod list includes 17 new records for the State of Nebraska. This collection is housed in the Harold W. Manter Laboratory of Parasitology (HWML), University of Nebraska State Museum, at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and serves as a taxonomic base for our continued efforts to establish a long-term catalog of parasites associated with small mammals in southwestern Nebraska.

N2  - Pandirodesmus rutherfordi, n. sp., represented by 18 individuals including eight adult males, occurs in secondary forests near Charlotteville and Speyside, Tobago, Trinidad and Tobago. Along with the type and second species, P. disparipes Silvestri, from Guyana and known only from females, the segmental legs of P. rutherfordi alternate between long (anterior pairs) and short (posterior ones), spiracular openings are on straw-like tubules, and ozopores are located on paramedian metatergal spines. These features appear to be adaptations for biotopes of loose sand, detritus, or frass, and 17 specimens, including the six juveniles, exhibit coatings of “sand grains” that are loosely cemented together and to the smooth, translucent, grayish-white exoskeleton. The tubules and spines elevate the spiracles and ozopores above the coating, thereby ensuring that they remain open and functional. The coating, which provides camoufl age and lends strength and rigidity to the poorly sclerotized exoskeleton, is a subuniform “pavement” that covers the entire animal except the labrum/clypeus, tarsal and antennal apices, prozonae, paraprocts, and the gonopods in males. Ramose/dendritic setae, particularly on narrowly rounded podo-/antennomeres, trap “sand grains,” and the ozopore secretions apparently constitute the “glue” that cements the coating, as evidenced circumstantially by layers of “sand” between the spines on the anterior metaterga, where they are physically closest. The alternating segmental leg lengths, in part due to differing ventrolateral and ventromedial origins, appear to be an adaptation for lateral/sideways motion in which the long (anterior) legs extend laterally and pull the body to the level of the short (posterior) ones, which continue the motion while the anterior legs extend to begin the next stroke. The opposing legs perform the complementary pushing motion a fraction after the long legs initiate the pulling stroke and hence are slightly and purposefully out of sync. An adult male paratype lacks the coating, probably because it had just molted and lacked time to amass it; the juvenile female paratype of P. disparipes also is “naked,” as was, according to Silvestri, the now lost adult female holotype. Until fresh material is collected, coatings cannot be confi rmed for P. disparipes even though it shares the anatomical modifi cations that seem adaptions for such. The minute, triramous gonotelopodites of P. rutherfordi are unlike any known for a chelodesmid, so the current generic placement, in a monotypic tribe in the nominate chelodesmid subfamily, is retained. With species in both South America and the southern Antilles, Pandirodesmus/ini had to exist on both the “proto-Antillean” terrane and the adjoining part of Pangaean Gondwana before the former rifted in the Cretaceous/Paleocene, ~66 million years ago, and P. rutherfordi is a remnant of the former population that became isolated on present-day Tobago when the terrane fragmented. Affi nity between Guyanan and southern Antillean platyrhacid millipeds (Polydesmida: Leptodesmidea) suggest that Pandirodesmus/ini may occur sporadically as far north in the island chain as St. Lucia.

We collected eight species of Histeridae, four species of Leiodidae and eight species of Scarabaeidae from the burrows of Geomys breviceps Baird. Three of the Histeridae were new state records, Geomysaprinus goffi Ross, G. rugosifrons (Fall) and Margarinotus felipae (Lewis). All of the Leiodidae were new state records and one Scarabaeidae was a new state record, Dellacasiellus concavus (Say). The most commonly collected scarab beetles were Cryptoscatomaseter haldemani (Horn) and Geomyphilus insolitus (Brown). The most commonly collected hister beetle was Onthophilus kirni Ross. The Leiodidae were infrequently captured.

N2  - A revised annotated checklist for the butterfl y family Lycaenidae (Lepidoptera) of Trinidad is presented, updating nomenclature, and indicating synonyms from earlier lists and papers. The checklist includes 131 species of Lycaenidae, comprising 127 species of 49 genera of Eumaeini, Theclinae, and four species of three genera of Polyommatinae. There are more than 30 new island records. No lycaenid species is endemic to Trinidad, and the fauna consists primarily of widespread species (71%) that occur from Central America to the Amazon Basin. However, the primary biogeographic affi nity is the Amazon Region, where 94% of the Trinidad lycaenid fauna also occurs. Corrections are made to the literature cited in the fi rst author’s earlier checklists on other Trinidad butterflies.

Se presentan más de 30 nuevo registros procedente de la isla. Ninguna especies de lycaenido es endémico de Trinidad, y la fauna consiste principalmente de especies de amplia distribución (71%) que ocurren desde Centroamérica hasta la Cuenca del Amazonas. Sin embargo, la principal afi nidad biogeográfi ca es la Región Amazónica, donde el 94% de la fauna de lycaenidos de Trinidad ocurren.

N2  - The Republic of Panama currently has 300 recorded species of Trichoptera distributed among 14 families. Herein we add 42 new country records for Panama, including one new family (Anomalopsychidae) and three new genera (Anomalopsychidae: Contulma; Hydroptilidae: Byrsopteryx and Cerasmatrichia). The newly recorded caddisfly taxa increase Panama’s total known fauna to 342 species, distributed among 15 families and 50 genera. These results are part of an ongoing effort to characterize the caddisfly fauna of Panama, and to evaluate that country’s major watersheds (cuencas).

N2  - Information on the taxonomy, anatomy, and bionomics of the species of Psalydolytta Peringuey is presented and summarized. Psalydolytta testaceoapicalis Pic, described from Guinea, is placed in the synonymy of P. cineracea (Maklin)(new synonymy). The genus has a disjunct Ethiopian_Indian distribution (42 species in Africa, 10 in India). Adults appear toward the end of the rainy season, are generally nocturnal, and feed largely on flowers and developing grains of wild and cultivated grasses. Adults attracted to lights are sometimes a nuisance because of their ability to produce blisters on human skin. The larva of the Indian P. rouxi (Castelnau) has been recorded as a predator of the eggs of the pyrgomorphid grasshopper Colemania sphenarioides< Bolivar and that of the African P. fusca (Oliver) as a predator of the eggs of the acridid grasshopper Cataloipus fuscocoeruleipes (Sjostedt).

N2  - Tergissima and Femniterga, new genera, are described from hitherto seldom sampled localities of 500-1700m. altitude in Salta, Jujuy and Tucuman provinces, Argentina. The new genera are allied to New World Calycopis and Netropical Calystryma, but differ from the generic characters of these in having extreme terminoventrad development of the incised posterior cavity of the eighth abdominal tergite (Tergissima males, Femniterga, males and females), distinctive genitalic characters and forewing markings on males suggestive of secondary sexual brands. Morphology of the four genera is compared in detail. Four new species are described: T. mosconiensis, T. macphersoni, F. notastanea and F. jundae, three of which are also distributed northward into eastern Bolivia.

N2  - Generic, subgeneric, specific, subspecific, and infra-subspecific names in Paederus (sensu lato) are compiled alphabetically with literature references, showing that 622 specific names stand in the literature as valid. Five replacement names are required due to homonymy: Paederus cumanus Frank [ nom. nov. for Paederus bicolor Wendeler nec Olivier], Paederus sulawesi Frank [ nom. nov. for Paederus melanocephalus Heller nec Fabricius], Paecerus zairensis Frank [nom. nov. for Paederus orophilus Fagel nec Paederidus brunnescens orophilus (Fagel)], Paederus irianensis Frank [nom. nov. for Paederus litoreus Last nec Paederus littoreus Austin], and Oreopaederus manyemensis Frank [nom. nov. for Oreopaederusater (Bernhauer) nec Paederidus rubrothoracicusater (Eichler)]. Four unjustified replacement names ( Paederus archeus Blackwelder, Paederus homonymus Blackwelder, Paederus erichoni Wollaston, and Paederus samoensis Fauvel) are here attributed to their respective senior synonyms ( Paederus elongatus Wendeler, Paederus tricolor Erichson, Paederus angolensis Erichson, and Paederus vitiensis Fauvel). Paederus limnophilus Erichson is a junior synomym of Paederus limophilus Heer. Of the 622 names, one is that of a fossil species and 264 are of species which have not yet been attributed to taxa more precise than Paederus (sensu lato). Concepts of the Afrotropical/Malagasy species are due to Fagel (1958a-1973), and among the 281 species recognized, 157 are attributed to Paederus Fabricius (sensu Fagel) and the remainder to the related genera Paederidus Mulsant & Rey (36), Allopaederus Fagel (3), Madecapaederus Fagel (11), Pachypaederus Fagel (19), and Oreopaederus Fagel (55). Concepts of classification of species from other parts of the world are due mainly to Scheerpeltz (1957); 14 are attributed to the Asian genera Ctenopaederus Fagel (1), Eupaederus Scheerpeltz (2), Diplopaederus Scheerpeltz (2), Oncopaederus Scheerpeltz (1) and Megalopaederus Scheerpeltz (8), while 46 species of the western Paleartic region ate attributed to Paedelus (sensu Scheerpeltz and Coiffait) (33) and related genera Paedetldus (10), Lobopaederus Scheerpeltz (1), Parameropaederus Scheerpeltz (1), and Uncopaederus Korge (1). Eleven names stand as subgenera of Paederus (Pseudopaederus, Bernhauer, Gnathopaederus Chapin, Eopaederus Scheerpeltz, Harpopaederus Scheerpeltz, Heteropaederus Scheerpeltz, Dioncopaederus Scheerpeltz, Oedopaederus Scheerpeltz, Anomalopaederus Scheerpeltz, Oreinopaederus Scheerpeltz, and Nepalopaederus Scheerpeltz), but none of these has many species attributed to it and only the western Palearctic species have been assigned systematically to subgenera. Paederus (sensu lato) is the subtribe Paederi (Casey 1905, Fagel 1958a) or Paederina (Herman 1981), with the subtribe Dolicai (Fagel 1958a) or Dolicaonina (Herman 1981) as closest relative. The 2 major taxonomic needs are to review and redescribe the species of the Nearctic, Neotropical, Oriental, Oceanian and Australasian regions, and to extend Fagel&#039;s (1958a) methods to examine the higher classification of Paederus (sensu lato) worldwide.

N2  - The genus Rhagovelia is revised for the region comprising Borneo, Celebes, and the Moluccas Redescriptions are given for species previously described from the area, and 26 new species are described. Figures of the dorsal habitus and key characters are provided for all species, accompanied by a key to species and distribution maps. Species occurring in the region are divided into eight monophyletic intrageneric species groups, some of which also contain members outside the region, based primarily on wing venation, thoracic morphology, and genitalia. A zoogeographic analysis is presented based on the distribution of these groups within the Malay Archipelago and surrounding regions. We conclude that the present Rhagovelia fauna of the Malay Archipelago is derived from species which originated in continental Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Caledonia. Distinct lineages have entered the region from each of these three source areas, penetrating the archipelago with differing degrees of success and contributing to the fauna of each individual island to varying extents. Species groups of Asian origin do not extend beyond Celebes and the Lesser Sunda islands, while species groups of Papuan origin are absent in the Lesser Sundas and do not extend west of Borneo. Endemic species groups have also arisen on New Guinea, the Philippines, the north Moluccas, and Borneo. A section on ecology and behavior is provided, dealing in particular with the altitudinal segregation of species on individual islands. The following new Rhagovelia species are described: bacanensis, borneensis, celebensis, christenseni, grayi, hamdjahi, incognita, lorelinduana, meikdelyi, melanopsis, minahasa, obi, pruinosa, ranau, sabela, samardaca, samarinda, sarawakensis, silau, simulata, sondaica. sulawesiana, tawau, tebakang, unica, and wallacei. Rhagovelia mindanaoenis Hungerford and Matsuda 1961 is synonymized with Rhagooelia orientalis Lundblad 1937 (new synonymy).

N2  - Promatsumura is proposed as a replacement name for the taxonomically unavailable generic name Proctoeon Matsumura, 1931 Proctoeon nipponicum Matsumura is designated as the type-species. Matsumura (1931a) established the new baetid genus Procloeon from Japan to include the new species P. nipponicum and P. tamugawanum, both based on the female. Although he did not specifically state that he was establishing a new genus, Matsumura (1931b)listed Procloeon as one of several new genera, including some generic homonyms, established by Matsumura in this work. Workers on Ephemeroptera have traditionally accepted the list of new taxa in Insecta Matsumurana, and I, as well, consider this practice to be correct However, the name Procloeon is preoccupied by Procloeon Bengtsson, 1915 and must be considered a junior homonym of it. According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Procloeon Matsumura, 1931, is not available for nomenclatural purposes and must be replaced. In establishing Procloeon Matsumura also failed to designate a type-species for the genus. Again according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Procloeon Matsumura is not available for taxonomic purposes because no type-species was designated (Article 13b). I propose the replacement name [nomen novum] Promatsumura for the preoccupied and nomenclaturally unavailable Procloeou Matsumura, 1931 and designate Procloeon nipponicum Matusumura, 1931, as the typespecies. The name is derived from Plodoeon and Matsumura: the gender is feminine. Species included in Promatsumura: Promatsumura nipponicum (Matsumura) NEW COMBINATION (from Procloeon ) and Promatsumura tamagawanum (Matsumura) NEW COMBINATION (from Procloeon ). Promatsumura nipponicum and P. tamagawanum have not been discussed in the scientific literature since their original description and nothing is known about these species beyond Matsumura&#039;s brief descriptions. Our knowledge of the systematic relationships of these species to other Baetidae remains somewhat vague and proper subfamilial placement is unknown.

A key to Svarciella species is presented and 14 new species are described and illustrated: M. floreni (Sweden), M. aterga, M. fanta, M. furculipexa, M. brachyptera, M. amphicuspa (all Nepal), M. triplex, M. cornigera (both Malaysia), M. concinna, M. hastata (both Philipines), M. spinifera (Papua New Guinea), M. flagrella (Bismark Is.), M. xanthosceles (Ecuador) and M. xestops (USA: Florida). M. furculisterna (Deeming 1969) is redescribed, including the previously undescribed female, and recorded from Japan. The female of M. unica (Papp 1973) is described for the first time and the species is recorded from northern Europe. M. hackmani (Rohacek 1977) is removed from synonymy with M.dissimilicosta (Spuler 1925) and synonymized under M. unica (Papp). M. paravitripennis (Papp 1973) is a new synonym of M. vitripennis (Zetterstedt 1847). The egg of M. concinna sp.n. is described and illustrated. The phylogeny and biogeography of world Svarciella species are discussed.

N2  - The identification of North American Dolichoderus species by-way-of existing keys is unnecessarily arbitrary and misdeterminations are likely between D. mariae and D. pustulatus, the latter species showing most morphological variation over its range. Diagnoses for the four described species and an undescribed form with a revised key and figures are given to aid entomologists working without identified voucher specimens. Nest data for species other than D. pustulatus in the Coastal Plain revealed below-ground nests or structures immediately at the ground surface. Colonies of D. pustulatas in Florida and southern Georgia have arboreal nests in the cavities of smaller limbs of hardwoods about swamps and marshes. No ground nests have been found and the species may occur in compound nests with another arboreal ant, Camponotas (Colobopsis) impressus. These observations identify several questions for further study.

N2  - Documentation is developed for Conomyrma insana (Buckley) and C. flava (McCook) as valid names for two abundant species of ants in the United States. Taxonomic history, synonymies, diagnostic criteria, distribution and natural history for both species are reviewed. The intraspecific variability, particularly important for C. flava, is summarized. Neotype and lectotype specimens are designated for C. insana and C. flava respectively, and a key provided for all known Conomyrma species in the United States.

N2  - The Pantomorus viridisquamosus species group can be separated from other Pantomorus Schoenherr, because it has recumbent setae, slender antennae with funicular article 2 almost as long as 1, glabrous scutellum, indistinct humeri, and hind tibiae lacking corbel plate and with dorsal comb about as long as apical comb. It is composed of two species, P. viridisquamosus (Boheman) from central and northeastern Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil, and P. obrieni Lanteri sp.nov. from northeastern Argentina and southern Brazil. Pantomorus obrieni differs from P. viridisquamous because it is smaller and has carinate scales, shorter and wider setae, more conical rostrum, and more convex eyes, pronotum and elytra. The female of P. viridisquamosus is redescribed and the male described (males are very infrequent). Line drawings and SEM illustrations of the diagnostic structures, and a distributional map are included.

There is little intraspecific variation and alary polymorphism is not normally detectable. The role of such exposed wings is discussed and one new species is described. Most such species probably owe their evident relationship to evolution prior to the disintegration of the Gondwanaland super-continent.

N2  - A new genus, Femtapion (type species F. andersoni Kissinger, new species from central Mexico), is described in the tribe Aplemonini. Distinguishing features include body minute, globose, glabrous, polished; middle coxae not separated by union of median mesosternum and median metasternum; elytra lack humeri but (apparently) functional flying wings present; endophallus with coiled flagellum. The occurrence of a modified endophallic flagellum is unique in the New World Apioninae (with the exception of the Antilles). Perapion wickhami (Kissinger) is recorded from Scotts Bluff, Nebraska Apion (Trichapion) memnonmonum Kissinger from North Carolina shows an unusual disjunct distribution. It is recorded on unopened flower buds of Amorpha sp. at 3 mi NE Angeles Oaks, camp Cedar Falls 6000&#039;, San Bernardino Co., California in June.

Phylogenetic analysis sorts 15 species of Gnamptogenys into four species groups. Phylogenetic analyses on the six ectatommine genera suggest that: 1) Gnamptogenys and Ectatomma are sister genera, 2) Proceratium and Discothyrea are sister genera, 3) Acanthoponera may be more related to Gnamptogenys and Ectatomma than to the others, and 4) Paraponera may not belong with the other five genera.

N2  - The genus Vaeiovis C. L. Koch in the Mexican state of Sonora is reviewed, based on the examination of numerous specimens from United States collections. Four species are reported to occur there: Vaejovis spinigerus (Wood), V. confusus Stahnke, V. sonorae Williams, and V. decipiens Hoffmann. Distributional information for all four species is updated, and a key is provided to facilitate identification. The subspecies V. spinigerus sonorensis Hoffmann is synonymized with V. spinigerus. The record for V. gravicaudus Williams on Isla Tiburon (Williams 1980) is demonstrated to be a misidentification resulting from atypical variation in the closely related V. spinigerus, which is common on the island. A record for V. waueri Gertsch and Soleglad is considered the result of accidental introduction, because additional specimens have not been seen in the well-sampled Alamos area. It is suggested that the genus is probably more diverse than demonstrated here; several species from neighboring Arizona probably occur in Sonora, and new species may eventually be discovered in the poorly sampled interior.

N2  - Trypoxylon (Trypargilum) mexicanum (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) belongs to the albitarse group, which includes the larger species of the genus. Its native distribution extends throughout Central America from Mexico to Panama. Here it is reported for the first time from Hispaniola, West Indies. Because it is difficult to envisage such a conspicuous species having eluded capture any naturalist or aculeate specialist previously, I consider that it has recently arrived on the island. It may have arrived due to the trade with Central America, since the nests, made of mud, can easily transport the immatures that subsequently emerge and disperse after their arrival on the island. T. mexicanum is established at least in the Dominican Republic, with a wide distribution and large populations. This demonstrates the ecological success of a recently established population on the island, perhaps due to escape from natural enemies and an absence of other limiting factors. The females were observed at puddles of water on the roads where they pick up mud with which they construct their tubular nests. Brood cells were provisioned exclusively with several species of spiders of Araneidae. An endemic spider, Eustala bisetosa Bryant was also used as prey. Other data about natural history is also provided.

N2  - Specific Alaskan and Canadian localities are recorded for the chilopod Scolopocryptops sexspinosus(Say) (Cryptopidae), the only indigenous Nearctic scolopendromorph species occurring north of the lower 48 states. It occurs west of the crest of the Coast Range in British Columbia, extending northward to the southernmost islands of Alaska, and is recorded for the first time from eastern Canada, from Niagara Gorge, Ontario. Reports of S. rubiginosus Koch from southern Alaska are based on a misidentification of S. sexspinosus, and records from the north-central United States are too distant from the international border for it to be plausible for Manitoba and western Ontario. This centipede does not occur along the Pacific Coast and is improbable for any other part of Canada.

N2  - Males of Neohermes concolor (Davis) from the interior highlands of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri, and from Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky exhibited considerable variation in male terminalia. Differences occurred in the size of the dorsal membrane of the ninth sternite and in the shape of the tenth tergite (anal plate) which varied from rounded to truncate shaped. This observed variation does not appear to be geographically correlated. Females of N. concolor did not exhibit broad variation in terminalia. Little variation was observed among males of N. angusticollis (Hagen) and N. matheri Flint. The broad range of variation observed in the terminalia of N. concolor could result in misidentification by collectors who rely only on the shape of the anal plate rather than the more constant shape of the aedeagus.

N2  - The fauna of Curculionoidea (exclusive ofthe subfamilies Scolytinae and Platypodinae of the Curculionidae) is surveyed for Dade and Monroe Counties in southern Florida. Numbers of genera and species represented are as follows: Anthribidae (12 genera, 22 species), Belidae (1 genus, 2 species), Attelabidae (3 genera, 3 species), Brentidae (6 genera, 14 species) and Cureulionidae (1115 genera, 249 species). No Nemonychidae are recorded from southern Florida. Included in the totals are 25 species considered as introduced to the region and 5 species likely not established in the region. Twenty apparently undescribed species are recorded. Fifteen are assignable to genera as follows; Ormiscus (2)(Anthribidae),and Podapion(l)(Brentidae),and Prosaldius (l),Acalles(6),Callels (1), Zascelis (l), Notolomus (1), Lixus (1), and Conotrachelus (1) (Curculionidae). The generic placement of 5 undescribed species of Curculionidae is uncertain and descriptions of new genera may be required New generic records for the United States of America are Homocloeus Jordan(Anthribidae), and Stenotrupis Wollaston (Curculionidae;Cossoninae) and Heilus Kuschel (Curculionidae; Curculioninae). New species records for the United States are Homocloeus distentus Frieser and Homocloeus sexverrucatus (Suffrian) (Anthribidae) and Stenotrupis acicula Wollaston, Caulophilus rufotestaceus (Champion), Micromimus minimus (Boheman) (Curculionidae; Cossoninae), and Anthonomus rubricosus Boheman and Heilus bioculatus (Boheman) (Curculionidae; Curculioninae). Particularly well-represented in terms of species diversity is the anthribid genus Ormiscus (6), the brentid genus Apion (9) and the curculionid genera Listronotus (21), Anthonomus (14), Acalles (13), Conotrachelus (11), Tyloderma (10) and Sphenophorus (10).

The new taxa, to be attributed to Gagne, are as follows, in bold face: in Acacidiplosis: ananas, cespitosa, conica, crispa, echinata, erupta, hamata, imbricata, ramosa, rugosa, spinosa, undulata, and verticillata; in Aposchizomyia: acuta, brevis, crenata, longa, striata, and turnouri; Asphondylia napiformis; in Athidiplosis: bullata and walteri; in Contarinia: carolinae, hongoi, and plicata, Kimadiplosis diversa, in Lopesia. niloticae and armata. The larvae, pupae, and the host-specific galls of these species generally offer the best characters for species discrimination. Galls of several additional species of gall midges from Acacia spp. in Kenya are described, but the gall makers are left unnamed for lack of suitable specimens. Collula acaciae (Kieffer 1912) is shown to be a junior homonym of Collula acaciae (Kieffer 1909) and is renamed kiefferi. Gail midges from acacias in Africa, India, and Australia are reviewed. Cecidomyia acaciaelongifoliae Skuse (1890) from Australia is newly combined in Dasineura. Two of the new species, Acacidiplosisspinosa and Aposehizomyiaacula, inhibit flowering of Acacia nilotica and are potential biological control agents of their host in Australia.

(composed of H. sarahae sarahae, n.ssp. in China and H. sarahae laticapsula, n.ssp. in India and Pakistan), H balciunasi Bock known only from Australia, and a related species, H. bogorae, n.sp. from ,Java, Indonesia. These species all have the same primary host-plant species, i.e., Hydrilla verticillata, a fact making them all potential biocontrol agents for this aquatic plant pest in North America and other areas where it has pest status. Morphology is summarized as well as perceived synapomorphies of this species group.

N2  - The milliped genus Orophe, characterized by long, twisted gonopodal telopodites with short, subequal distal elements, is comprised of two allopatric species, O. cabinetus Chamberlin, in western Montana, and O. unicus (Loomis), in northern Idaho; the latter name is revived from synonymy with the former. They are distinguished by the orientation of the solenomerite, which is coaxial with the telopodite stem in O.cabinetus and perpendicular to it in O. unicus. Although this distinction is slight, it manifests itself geographically, and the forms occupy mutually exclusive areas; hence they warrant specific recognition. Modern descriptions are provided for the genus and species, and new localities are reported. Gonopodal illustrations and a distribution map are presented.

H. alabamae, n. sp. was first collected on water primrose in northern Alabama and later in northern Florida on Nuphar and Nymphoides At present, there is no indication about potential host-plant species. H. naiadis, n. sp. was reared from Najas guadalupensis (Spreng) Morong in northern Florida and later collected throughout the state and also in southeastern Texas H apalachee, n. sp., first collected in northern Florida and later in northern Alabama, is unique among described Hydrellia in having a bivittate mesonotum. Thus fur, no host-plant species is known for this species. H. limnobii, n sp. was first. reared from Limnobium spongia (Bosc) Richard (frogbit) in 1986 at the Florida Biological Control Laboratory and has since been collected throughout the state as well as in southern Louisiana and southeastern Texas. The last species, H. pontederiae, n. sp., with males 4.00 mm and females 4.80 mm long, is the largest species in the genus as known by me; it has been reared from Pontederia cordata Linnaeus, but only one specimen (a female) has been collected in the field.

N2  - The subfamily Asopinae of the stinkbug family Pentatomidae is revised for the Old World with a key to the genera and a review of the species with nomenclatural changes. The genus Tahitocoris is removed from the Asopinae and placed tentatively with the Podopinae. The genus Breddiniella is reduced to a synonym of Cazira. The genus Incitatus is reduced to a synonym of Martinina. The genus Platynopus is divided into three genera by the restriction of Platynopus to include only five Indo- Pacific species; the elevation of the subgenus Montrouzieriellus to the level of full genus, and the erection of a new genus Platynopiellus for the African species formerly placed in Platynopus. A new genus Australojalla is erected for Jalla versicolor. The genera Cantheconidea and Eocanthecona are defined and their respective species aligned in concordance with their definitions. Fourteen species are thus transferred from Cantheconidea to Eocanthecona creating the following new combinations: Eocanthecona japanicola, Eocanthecona binotata, Eocanthecona latipes, Eocanthecona mitis, Eocanthecona neotibialis, Eocanthecona ornatula, Eocanthecona parva, Eocanthecona plebeja, Eocanthecona robusta, Eocanthecona rufescens, Eocanthecona shikokuensis, Eocanthecona thomsoni, Eocanthecona tibialis, and Eocanthecona vollenhoveni. Eocanthecona migratoria is transferred to the genus Afrius creating the new combination Afrius migratorius. Also, Canthecona populusi is transferred to Eocanthecona giving the new combination Eocanthecona populusi. Anasida ikrami is transferred to the genus Pseudanasida giving the new combination Pseudanasida ikrami. Afrius discolor glypsoides is placed in synonymy under Cantheconada discolor. Asopus rufus is synonymized under Amyotea malabarica Arma neocusta and Arma neoinsperata are synonymized under Arma custos.

N2  - The blind click-beetles are the larger tenebrionids of Cuba. In our territory there are two species described, Zophobas rugipes Kirsch with a wide distribution in other West Indies, Central and South America, and Z. cubanus Marcuzzi, endemic to Cuba. Other authors had exposed the variability of Z. rugipes. We have compared all the available material from Cuban collections and have reached the conclusion that the diagnostic characters exposed for Z. cubanus, based on a small series, are not valid. Therefore, we consider this taxon as an individual variation of Z. rugipes, and synonymize Z. cubanus under Z. rugipes.

Triplehorn (1962) described the genus Loxostethus from the West Indies, describing unicolor from Puerto Rico; jamaicensis from Jamaica; and fasciatus and opacifrons from Cuba. Later, Zayas (1989), described L. quadrimaculata from Trinidad, Cuba. However, this latter form falls within the individual variation of L. fasciatus according to Triplehorn's descriptions Therefore, L. quadrimaculata is relegated to synonymy under Loxostethus fasciatus. Gundlach had represented in his collection these two taxa under the genus Cyphiscus Chevrolat, a name that if it was ever published, was not in the family Tenebrionidae. A new species from Baracoa, Guantanamo, Loxostethus baracoae is here described. Comparisons and notes about habitat and distribution of this genus are also given.

N2  - A bibliography is presented on Hydrellia griseola (Fallen), a cosmopolitan species of shore fly that is an agricultural pest throughout much of its range. The literature review includes 195 references and spans 180 years: from 1813, when H. griseola was first described (as Notophila griseola), to 1993. My review updates and extends by 110 years a previous review of this species. The host plant associations, bionomics, distribution, pest status, and control of this species are reviewed. The known host plants of larval H. griseola are listed. My survey ofthe literature supports the hypothesis that H. griseola is increasing its range as a pest of rice. H. griseola can be controlled by cultural or chemical methods, but due to agronomic and environmental constraints on these methods, my review points out the need for more research on and use of the natural enemies of H. griseola.

N2  - The subgenus Portmannia Young (1980) of the Neotropical genus Desmopachria is characterized by its ovate, sometimes almost globose body form, smooth shining integument between relatively fine punctures, and sexually dimorphic prostemal process. In the females the prosternal process comes to a point as in other members of Desmopachria, but in males the process is bifid or forked. The species are found from Texas and Arizona to Brasil in South America. They are particularly abundant in Mexico. A key is given for twelve species which are described and figured. The following species are described as new: decorosus (Mexico), goias (Brasil),pittieri (Costa Rica), sobrina (Mexico) and zethus (Mexico). The color is variable. Some species are relatively darkly colored without distinct darker markings, and usually with some coarser punctation on part of the dorsum. These seem to be characteristic of the tropical forests (D. laevis Sharp and D. specula Sharp. D. goias is also dark with vague spots on the elytra). Most of the Mexican and Central American species are characterized by at least parts of the elytra being lighter in color than the head and pronotum, sometimes strikingly contrasting. The latter group may or may not have a distinct dark color patterns of the elytra or on head and pronotum. In both groups some species are intensely dark brown or black beneath, but this character may be influenced by degree of hardening of the cuticle. Nearly all the species have darker markings along the suture of the elytra and base of the pronotum. Some species are distinctly patterned on the elytra which probably represents disruptive coloration helping to conceal them in the clear, sand-bottomed habitats in which most occur.

They walk very slowly, cannot escape by flight, and their majestic bearing can be compared to the Athenian Judges, the Tlmarches. Unfortunately, they are vulnerable to habitat disturbance, insecticides, and environmental changes. Some of the European such as Timarcha tenebricosa and T. goettinqensis are becoming more and more rare because of these same habitat changes.

(L.) ignotus, L. (L.) profugus, L.

In addition distributional maps are provided. The species characteristic for each main geographic area of Argentina are: E. fuscinervis and T. taylori for the Northwestern mountainous area; L. ignotus, L. lubricus, and R. crassifemur for the Chacoan plain; L. ignotus and H.platensis for the Bonarian plain; L. ignotus. R. bonariensis, H. platensis and O. gualeguay for the Mesopotamian plain. E. fuscinervis and T. taylori are restricted to mountain rivers and rivulets, whereas the remaining species seem to be genuine inhabitants of either rivulets in forested hilly areas (L. aduncus, L. profugus, B. albinerva, H. spiniventris, M. plaumanni and M. vigilis), or rivers. rivulets and ponds m plains (L. ignotus, L. lubricus, R. bonariensis, R. crassifemur, H platensis, and O. gualeguay). L. ignolus is a pioneer species in lowlands, readily colonizing new pools. Excepting L. aduncus, L. profugus, and O. gualeguay which are rare, the remaining species are common in Argentina (no enough data are available for B. albinerva, M. plaumanni, and M. vigilis). Gregariousness is high in E. fuscinervis, R. bonariensis, R. crassifemur, and H. platensis, and probably also in B. albmerva. The other species mentioned seem not to be gregarious, but O. gualeguay appears sometimes in the dense aggregations of H. platensis, suggesting some gregarious tendency.

N2  - Previously known from northeastern United States and Virginia, Bembidion rufotinctum Chaudoir is recorded from North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, and Georgia. Habitat preference for this species appears to remain the same throughout its range. Specimens may be found hiding in cracks in rocks exposed to rapidly flowing water. The presence of this species may be indicated by Pentacora ligata (Say)(Hemiptera: Saldidae) that occurs on the same rocks.

Three of these represent unnamed species and are described as new: Celaenorrhinus orneates Austin, Celaenorrhinus par Steinhauser & Austin, and Celaenorrhinus autochton Steinhauser & Austin. The male of C. savia is described for the first time. Both sexes of all 8 species (except female C. orneates) and their genitalia are illustrated. Males of C. savia and C. orneates are similar to C. jao in lacking tibial tufts, modified thoracic scales, and abdominal pouches; C. autochton lacks tibial tufts and modified thoracic scales. This adds to the diversity of secondary sexual characters among New World Celaenorrhinus. The following taxa, treated by Evans (1952) as subspecies, are raised to specific rank C shema disjunctus Bell; 1940; C similis stola Evans, 1952; C. similis approximatus Williams & Bell, 1940; and C. similis bifurcus Bell, 1934.

Twelve species inhabit the Greater Antilles (with two exclusive endemics), four species are found in the Lesser Antilles (with two exclusive endemics), and 11 species are found in Trinidad, four of which are exclusive endemics Two species are shared between the Greater and the Lesser Antilles. Nine of the 12 species of the Greater Antilles also occur in Mexico and the U.S., eight species also occur in Central America and three species are also found in South America. One of the four species of the Lesser Antilles is also found in Mexico, the U.S., Central and South America. Four of the 11 species of Trinidad also occur in North America, four are also found in Central America, and four are also found in South America. There is a sharp drop in number of species from Trinidad to the islands north of it. The assemblages of Lachesilla species of the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and Trinidad are distinct. The genus has undergone little speciation in the Greater and in the Lesser Antilles; in Trinidad some speciation may have occurred by isolation from mainland populations. The greater diversity of Lachesilla on Trinidad may be due to more collecting and to greater proximity to the mainland.

N2  - A new species of Diastolinus D burtoni is described for the Islands of Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac (Cayman Islands). Local forms are characterized by displaying a conspicuous enlargement of the front tibia, character not found in any Cuban species. However, Diastolinus dentipes (endemic to Grand Cayman) was also collected in Cayo Largo del Sur, Archipelago de Los Canarreos, Cuba. Therefore this species, could no longer be considered endemic to the Cayman Islands. Whether the original dispersion occurred from Cayman Island to Cayo Largo or vice versa, is hard to prove, nevertheless, the distinctive character of the dilatation of the front tibias of Caymanian&#039;s animals strongly suggest the former variant.

N2  - The scarab genus Cnemida includes eight species (including C. gigantea Jameson n. sp. from Colombia and C. tristriata Jameson n sp. from Surinam) that inhabit tropical moist and premontane forests of South America, Central America, and Mexico. Keys to adults, diagnostic characters, descriptions, and distributions are presented. The larva of C. intermedia Bates is described and integrated into a key to larvae of the tribe Rutelini. A cladistic analysis among the species of Cnemida is based on 35 morphological characters and uses members of the genera Pelidnota and Rutela as outgroups. Four equally parsimonious cladograms are discussed.

N2  - After obtaining fresh material of Opairinus puertoricenis from Puerto Rico a comparison was done with a large series of O. armasi. This latter taxon had been previously compared with Marcuzzi&#039;s original description, mainly based on his illustration of male genitalia from Jamaica reckoned to be O. puertoricensis . Genitalia from O. p. puertoricensis (from Puerto Rico) and O. armasi, proved to be quite alike. Also morphological characters of the two populations are not very distinct, offering differentiations better considered under subspecific rather than specific level. Therefore, we propose considering O. armasi Garrido and Gutierrez, 1994, as a subspecies associated with O. puertoricenis Marcuzzi, 1977. Based on the differences shown in the male genitalia of O. armasi and O. puertoricensis from Puerto Rico and Jamaica, we consider that the animals from Jamaica are different from Puerto Rico&#039;s (O. puertoricensis), and therefore constitute an undescribed species different from O. puertoricensis. Specimens assigned to O. pullus from Cuba and Puerto Rico, do not differ, either morphologically, or in their genitalia, therefore both populations should be treated as members of the same taxon. Male genitalia of O. armasi, O. puertoricensis and O. pullus are herein illustrated.

Eight new species are herein described and illustrated. Also their genitalia are illustrated, as well as some of the previously described species not illustrated by Ardoin in his original descriptions. Material from several eastern localities assigned to T. decui are not exactly identical, showing some variations at subspecific level. Although these variations are mentioned, they are not described. The same situation applies to populations assigned to the new species described from the northern part of Santa Clara (the cave complex of Caguanes). Genitalia of six of the eight new species are herein illustrated as are those of T. decui and T. poeyi . Photographs of the eight new taxa are also provided; as well as a synoptic table of the principal diagnostic characters of all taxa of the genus.

Tentative subgroups of species are suggested for the &quot;crossoea&quot; group as they occur in Rondonia. A neotype is designated for Tmolus basilides and the name synonymized with Strymon megarus. The &quot;basilides&quot; group of Johnson et al. (1990) is renamed the &quot;ziba&quot; group. Based on lectotype designations and superficial and genital differences, S. ziba. and S. thulia are elevated to specific status.

N2  - Motyxia Chamberlin is comprised of eight species of bioluminescent xystocheirine millipeds in which the gonopodal solenomere arises at different positions, from basally and subbasally on the acropodite to being fused with the companion acropodal branch and detaching proximad or near midlength. Previous synonymies of Amplocheir Chamberlin and Luminodesmus Loomis and Davenport under Motyxia are confirmed as is its assignment to the tribe Xystocheirini, which is redefined. Component species are M. kerna Chamberlin, the type species, monica Chamberlin, sequoiae (Loomis and Davenport), tularea (Chamberlin), sequoia (Chamberlin), pior Chamberlin, porrecta Causey and Tiemann, and tiemanni Causey. Motyxia sequoia is comprised of two races, the nominate and sequoia alia Causey and Tiemann; sequoia ollae Causey and Tiemann is properly a subspecies of tularea. Motyxia pior form secca is an invalid name without standing in nomenclature, and M. tejona Chamberlin, and M. expansa and exilis, both by Loomis, are placed in synonymy under M. monica, the oldest name for the southernmost species, as Polydesmue dissectus Wood is referrable to Xystocheir Cook. The bioluminescence is a continuous, neon-white glow of the entire dorsal surface including the antennae and legs. Its visibility at night suggests a warning function analogous to aposematic coloration. The phenomenon may observe a circadian rhythm, and controlled photoperiod experimentation may be productive.

N2  - The family Epipsocidae is defined, with the addition of one character not previously used. The genus Dimidistriata Li and Mockford is removed from Epipsocidae and tentatively placed in the family Dolabellopsocidae. The genus Parepipsocus Badonnel remains unplaceable to family. Eleven genera are recognized within Epipsocidae. Bertkauia Kolbe, which had been synonymized with Epipsocus, is recognized as a valid genus. Definitions of genera based on the type species and seemingly close relatives result in 38 new combinations. Epipsocus Hagen, which previously held most of the species, now serves a dual function, with 15 species in the strict sense and 15 species &#039;incertae sedis&#039; retained in it, pending further investigation. Goja Navas, previously with 2 species, now contains 10, with 8 transferred from Epipsocus. Mesepipsocus Badonnel, previously with 5 species, receives 24 more from Epipsocus and 1 from Dicropsocus. Eight species are transferred from Epipsocus to Epipsocopsis Badonnel. Notable consistency in geographic distributions of genera results from these transfers. Some evolutionary trends within the family are discussed. Epipsocus delicatus (Hagen) and E. completus Banks, which had been assigned by recent authors to the genus Pseudocaecilius Enderlein (Family Pseudocaeciliidae), are returned to the Epipsocidae and assigned to Epipsocopsis. A lectotype is designated for E. delicatus.

N2  - Prionus (Homaesthesis) simplex (Casey) was described (Casey, 1912:253) from one male specimen from Kansas with no further data. The specimen is in the United States National Museum and is illustrated by Chemsak (1996). Alexander (1958) reported P. simplex from two locations in Craig County, Oklahoma. Alexander&#039;s paper appears to be the basis for two localities shown in northeastern Oklahoma on the distribution maps given by Linsley (1962) and Chemsak (1996). The one locality shown in central Kansas on the map by Chemsak (1996) represents just a "state record" and not a specific collecting record (J. Beierl, Editor of Wolfsgarden Books, pers. comm.)

Two autapomorphic characters distinguish Wooldridgeini from the two other tribes of the subfamily Limnichinae; 1) the mesotarsus and metatarsus join their respective tibia ventrally (medially) and preapically instead of the usual apical only connection and 2) a large pore, presumed to be an opening of a prothoracic gland, is present on each hypomeron. Distinguishing characters are illustrated by scanning electron micrographs and line drawings. A key to the three tribes included in the Limnichinae is provided.

N2  - Therion Curtis (Ichneumonidae: Anomalinae) has a nearly cosmopolitan geographic distribution but has not previously been recorded from South America. In most Therion the tarsal claws are simple or have only a few inconspicuous teeth near the base. The new species described herein are distinctive, therefore, because they have the tarsal claws conspicuously pectinate over at least 0.8 the distance from base to apex. Therion ranti n.sp. from Cordoba and Mendoza Provinces of Argentina may be recognized by its almost uniformly red mesosoma and basally elevated clypeus. In Therion wileyi n.sp., from the Andean puna near La Paz in Bolivia, the mesosoma is red with extensive black coloration, including much of the propodeum, and the clypeus is weakly and symmetrically convex in profile. Therion wileyi n.sp. was reared from an unidentified noctuid moth larva infesting Chenopodium quinoa (Angiospermae: Chenopodiaceae), an important food crop in Andean South America.

These are the first from New Caledonia and bring the number to 37 species of the genus from Australia and nearby islands, all east of Wallace's Line. The new species are abdominalis, arboreus, brochus, caledonicus, concavus, cuspidis, dolichocara,gressitti, irwini, kraussi, nemoralis, nigripes. propodealis, schlingeri, scutellaris, sylvaticus, and webbi. All of these have an occipital carina, sometimes most evident ventrally. As a rule there are 2 forewing submarginal cells, but in caledonicus, dolichocara, nigripes, and propodealis there is only one such cell.

N2  - A taxonomic revision of the genus Cryptotermes occurring in the West Indies is given based on recent collections from the Greater Antilles, Lesser Antilles, and the Bahamas. Seventeen indigenous and four nonindigenous species are described from external morphology of the soldier. The imago caste is also described for all but one species. The indigenous Cryptotermes comprise twelve new species, including C. aequacornis, C. cryptognathus, C. cylindroceps, C. cymatofrons, C. darlingtonae, C.juliani, C. mangoldi, C. nitens, C.parvifrons, C. rotundiceps, C. spathifrons, and C. undulans. Five indigenous species are redescribed, including C. cavifrons Banks, C. chasei Scheffrahn, C.hemicyclius Bacchus, C.pyrodomus Bacchus, and C. rhicnocephalus Bacchus. The imagos of C.pyrodomus and C. rhicnocephalus are described for the first time. The four non-indigenous species are redescribed including C. brevis (Walker), C. domesticus (Haviland), C. dudleyi Banks, and C. havilandi (Sjostedt). A report of C. domesticus in the West Indies could not be confirmed. Distribution maps and a soldier identification key are included for all Cryptotermes in the West Indies and Florida.

N2  - Paracoccus marginatus Williams and Granara de Willink, here called the papaya mealybug, was first detected in the United States in Hollywood, Florida in 1998. By the end of 1998 it was found in four localities in the state and has since spread to nine localities in five counties. This mealybug appears to have moved through the Caribbean area since its 1994 detection in the Dominican Republic. The pest is reported to cause serious damage to tropical fruit, especially papaya, and has been detected most frequently, in Florida, on hibiscus. It is now known from Antigua, Belize, the British Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, Nevis, Puerto Rico, St. Barthelemy, St. Kitts, St. Martin, and the US Virgin Islands. Hosts include: Acacia sp.(Luguminosae), Acalypha sp.(Euphorbiaceae), Ambrosia cumanensis (Compositae), Annona squamosa (Annonaceae), Carica papaya (Caricaceae), Guazuma ulmifolia (Sterculiaccea), Hibiscus rosa-sinensis (Euphorbiaceae), Hibiscus sp. (Euphorbiaceae), Ipomoea sp. (Convolvulaceae), Manihot chloristica (Euphorbiaceae), Manihot eseulenta (Euphorbiaceae), Mimosa pigra (Lugiminosae), Parthenium hysterophorus (Compositae), Persea americana (Lauraceae), Plumeria sp. (Apocynaceae), Sida sp. (Malvaceae), Solanum melongena (Solanaceae). The species is believed to be native to Mexico and/or Central America.

N2  - A taxonomic review ofthe lebiine subtribe Pericalina in the Western Hemisphere, this paper includes a treatment of the genus-groups, a key to the genera, keys to subgenera, species groups, and species of each polybasic genus, descriptions of new species and new subgenera, new locality records for previously described species, re-rankings, and new synonymy. In total, 111 species and subspecies are treated, 26 of which are described as new. A review of the taxonomically useful mandibular structure, based on stereo-electron (SEM) photographs, requires changes in previously published names of various structures. A review of adhesive vestiture on the front tarsi of males shows 3 different types each characteristic of different taxa. In the eastern Brazilian montane genus Oreodicastes Maindron, 5 species are recognized, of which 3 are described as new (with type localities): O. aeaeus and O. minos (Campos de Jordao, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil); and O. rhadamanthus (Serra do Caraca, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil). In the wide-ranging genus Stenognathus Chaudoir, 19 species are recognized, and arranged in the following subgenera: the monobasic Prostenognathus, new subgenus (type species S. onorei, new species); the monobasic Gnathostenus new subgenus (type species S. dentifemoratus, new species); the polybasic Stenognathus (s. str.) (type species Anchomenus melanarius Dejean), with 16 species; and the monobasic Pristolomus Chaudoir (type species S. dentifer Chaudoir). Stenognathus cayennensis Buquet 1835 is a nomen dubium. The species of subgenus Stenognathus are arranged in 4 species groups: the S. stricticollis species group, with 4 species; the monospecific S. procerus species group; the S. nigropiceus species group (including Phloeotherates Bates and Ferus Chaudoir), with 6 species; and the S. melanarius species group, with 5 species. New species (with type localities) described herein: S. (Prostenognathus) onorei (West of Chiriboga, Pichincha Province, Ecuador); S. (Gnathostenus) dentifemoratus ("Colombia"); S. (sensu stricto, nigropiceus group) plaumanni (Nova Teutonia, State of Santa Catarina, Brazil); and S. (sensu stricto, nigropiceus group)jauja (Sani Beni, Jauja Province, Departamento Junin, Peru). Descriptions and new locality records are reported for the species known previously. For the principally Middle American genus Phloeoxena Chaudoir, the new monobasic subgenus Oxephloena is described: type species, P. turrialba, new species (Turrialba, Cartago Province, Costa Rica). Ochropisus Bates is included as a subgenus in Phloeoxena, and the following 5 new species (with type localities) are described: P. (O.) davidsoni (15 km. northwest of El Paraiso, State of Guerrero, Mexico); P. (O.) henryi (northeast slope of Volean Tacana, State of Chiapas, Mexico); P. (O.) nevermanni (western slopes of Volcan Irazu, Costa Rica.); P. (O.) turnbowi (near the trailhead of the Continental Divide Trail, Chiriqui Province, Panama); and P. (O.) lamuralla (Parque Nacional La Muralla, Olancho Department, Honduras). In Phloeoxena (Oenaphelox), the following 4 new species are described: P. (O.) totontepec (16.6 km south of Totontepec, State of Oaxaca, Mexico); P. (O.) brooksi (El Guisayote, 24 km east of Ocotepeque, Ocotepeque Department, Honduras); P. (O.) ashei (Parque Nacional La Muralla, 14 km north of La Union, Olancho Department, Honduras); and P. (O.) viridis (El Guisayote, 24 km east of Ocotepeque, Ocotepeque Department, Honduras). In Phloeoxena (s. str.), the following 2 new species are described: P. (P.) nitida (51.5 km south of Valle Nacional, State of Oaxaca, Mexico); and P. (P.) obscura (vicinity of Coscomatepec, State of Veracruz, Mexico). Based on study of the holotype, Phloeoxena biundata Steinheil is included in the subgenus Phloeoxena. The status of P. (P.) picta batesi Ball is changed from subspecies to species, based on new locality data indicating extensive range overlap of P. picta (sensu lato) and P. batesi. New locality records are provided for the following previously described species of Phloeoxena: P. (Tacana) herculeano Ball; P. (Ochropisus) concolor Ball (substantial range extension in western Mexico); P. (Ochropisus) caudalis Bates; P. (Oenaphelox) newtoni Ball (a second record); P. (Oenaphelox) undata Chaudoir; P. (Oenaphelox) geniculata Chaudoir; P. (Oenaphelox) signata Dejean; P. (s. str.) dealata Darlington; P. (s. str.) imitatrix Darlington; P. (s. str.) schwarzi Darlington; P. (s. str.)portoricensis Darlington; P. (s. sir.) megalops erioinorum Ball (range extension from Costa Rica to Panama; P. (s. sir.) limbicollis Bates; P. (s. sir.) nigricollis Ball; P. (s. str.) picta franiae Ball; P. (s. sir.)picta unicolor Chaudoir; P. (s. str.)picta picta Chaudoir; P. (s. str.)picta apicalis Ball; and P. (s. str.) batesi Ball. Two monobasic species and 1 dibasic species of the pantropical genus Catascopus Kirby are recognized. New synonymy is as follows: C. obscuroviridis Chevrolat 1835 = C. mexicanus Chaudoir 1877 = C. angulicollis Bates 1878; C. validus Chaudoir 1854 = C. guatemalensis Bates 1883; C. brasiliensis Dejean 1825 includes the South American C. b. brasiliensis (new status) = C. cayennensis Chaudoir 1872 and the Middle American C. b. chontalensis Bates 1878 (new status). New locality records for the 3 Middle American species, C. obscuroviridis, C. validus, and C. b. chontalensis show extensive range overlap. Nonetheless, C. validus seems to be isolated altitudinally from the other 2 species. Catascopus b. brasiliensis is a rather varied species and wide-ranging in South America, from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest to the Upper Amazon Basin, in Peru and Ecuador. The monospecific Chilean-Argentinian genus Catascopellus Straneo (type species C. crassiceps Straneo) is removed from the Somotrichus genus-group and placed in the monogeneric Catascopellus genus-group, primarily on the basis of divergence in the combination of structural details of the mouthparts and adhesive vestiture of the front tarsi of males. The Catascopellus genus-group in many of its diagnostic features is much like the Thyreopterus genus-group, but males of the 2 groups differ from one another in the adhesive vestiture of the fore tarsi. The known geographical range of C. crassiceps is extended from eastern Chile to western Argentina. The precinctive Neotropical Eurycoleus genus-group, including only Lelis Chaudoir and Eurycoleus Chaudoir, is recharacterized, with special reference to details ofthe mandibles and labium. The 4 valid species of Lelis, (with synonyms of the valid names) follow: the South American L. obtusangula (Chaudoir) 1852; the South American L. quadrisignata (Buquet) 1834 = L. polygona (Bates), 1869 = L. bifasciata Chaudoir 1869, new synonym = L. latipennis (Bates) 1869, new synonym; the South American-Middle American L. rutila (Bates) 1869 = L. viridipennis Chaudoir 1869 = L. cyanipennis Steinheil 1875, new synonym = L. insculpta (Bates) 1893, new synonym; and the Middle American L. bicolor Chaudoir 1869. Putative adelphotaxon relationships, based on structural details of adults, are: L. obtusangula (L. quadrisignata (L. rutila + L. bicolor)). Based on color pattern, the 8 species of the genus Eurycoleus Chaudoir are arranged in 2 species groups: the E. poecilopterus group with 2 species; and the E. tredecimpunctatus group, with 6 species. The species of the latter species group are arranged in 2 subgroups, the septemplagiatus subgroup, with 2 species, and the tredecimpunctatus subgroup, with 4 species, including E. erwini, new species (Estacion Sirena, Playa Sirena, Puntarenas, Costa Rica). Both species groups and both subgroups are represented in South America and Middle America by precinctive species. New locality records for Eurycoleus poecilopterus Buquet extend its range to northern Argentina, the southernmost area for the genus. The sole genus in the Western Hemisphere of the Pericalus genus-group, Copiodera Dejean, another pantropical genus, is represented by 44 species. New locality records are recorded for the following: C. elongata Putzeys; C. schaurni Chaudoir; C. megalops Bates (range extension into Middle America, from South America); C. championi Bates; C. versicolor Bates; C. nigrostriata (Reiche); C. lineata (Bates); C. transversa (Reiche); C. relucens Bates; C. festiva Dejean; C. aeneorufa Bates; C. tripartita Chaudoir; C. cupreotincta Bates; C. chalcites Bates; C. acutipennis Buquet (all recently acquired males were assigned to previously established morphs based on details of the armature of the internal sac); C. picea Dejean; C. nitidula Buquet; and C. brunnea Shpeley and Ball. A review of the classification of the Neotropical indigenous Eucheila genus-group, based on characters of newly discovered species, and on re-evaluation of relationships, indicates recognition of a single genus, Eucheila Dejean, with the following newly ranked taxa as subgenera: Hansus Ball and Shpeley (type species Hansus reichardti Ball and Shpeley); Bordoniella Mateu (type species Bordoniella lucida Mateu): Inna Putzeys (type species Inna punctata Putzeys); and Eucheila Dejean (type species Eucheila flavilabris Dejean). Pseudoinna Mateu (type species I. boliviana Mateu), described as a subgenus of Inna, is recognized as a subgenus of Eucheila. In subgenus Eucheila, a new species group is proposed: E. erwini species group, with 2 species. New species are: E. (Hansus) kiplingi (Puerto Misahuali, Napo Province, Ecuador); E. (Bordoniella) marginate. (Rio Tambopata Reserve [12°50&#039;S 069°20&#039;W], Departamento Madre de Dios, Peru); E. (Pseudoinna) mateui (Pakitza, Departamento Madre de Dios, Peru); E. (P) surinamensis (Rainville, Suriname district, Surinam); E. (Eucheila) erwini (Rio Napo Explomapocamp [03°15&#039;S 072°55&#039;W], Loreto Department, Peru); and E. (E.) pilosa (about 75 km south-southeast of Apoera, Nickerie District, Surinam). New distribution records are provided for the following species: E. (H.) reichardti (Ball and Shpeley) (range extension to Upper Amazon Basin in Peru, from Guyana in northeastern South America); E. (I.) purpurea (Ball and Shpeley); E. (I.) breviformis (Chaudoir); E.(I.)costulata (Chaudoir); E. (I.) boyeri (Solier) (range extension from mainland to Aruba, Dutch West Indies); E. (I.) nevermanni (Liebke) (range extension from Costa Rica to Panama); E. (I.) megala (Reichardt); E. (P) inpa (Ball and Shpeley) (range extension from Central to Upper Amazon Basin); E. (P) boliviana (Mateu) (range extension from Bolivia to Peru and Ecuador); E. (E.) strandi Liebke; E. (E.) cordova Ball and Shpeley (range extension from a single locality in Veracruz State, Mexico to Belize, in Middle America); E. (E.) adisi Ball and Shpeley (range extension from Central to Upper Amazon Basin, in Peru and Ecuador). Study of the mouthparts suggests that their evolution in the Pericalina of the Western Hemisphere has involved changes in form, reductions through loss or consolidation, and gains represented by additional setae. Overall, 2 basic types of mouthparts are recognizable: Type A, characteristic of the Eucheila genus-group; and Type B, characteristic of the Thyreopterus, Catascopellus, Pericalus, and Eurycoleus genus-groups. Type Aexhibits more numerous modifications than Type B, but the markedly derived features of Type A are combined with retention of plesiotypic features, suggesting that the Eucheila genus-group separated early from those genusgroups with Type B mouthparts. The basic Type B pattern has substantial modifications, useful for taxonomic recognition; both within and between genus-groups that exhibit this type of mouthparts, and probably for phylogenetic analysis. From a functional perspective, the less derived forms of mouthparts, as in, for example, the thyreopteroid Stenognatlius onorei, or the eucheiloid Eucheila marginata, indicate general predaceous feeding, involving particulate matter. The most striking modifications of the mouthparts, as seen in the subgenus Eucheila, suggest a profound change in food or feeding mechanisms, from consumption of particulate matter to consumption of liquids, or liquefied tissue. The distribution pattern of genera and species is fitted to a general model purporting to explain such patterns, in terms of plate tectonics, refuge theory, and climatic change during the Tertiary Period. Concluding remarks offer explanation of and justification for the taxonomic changes, including proposal of monobasic taxa and recognition of species based on limited material.

N2  - New records, nomenclatural changes and taxonomic notes are presented for select North American leaf beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). The following genera are newly recorded from the United States: Nesaecrepida Blake, 1964; Acallepitrix Bechyne, 1959; Margaridisa Bechyne, 1958; Parchicola Bechyne and Springlova de Bechyne, 1975; (all Galerucinae: Alticini); and Demotina Baly, 1874 (Eumolpinae). The following species are newly recorded from the United States: Neolema dorsalis (Olivier, 1791) (Criocerinae); Charidotella bifossulata Boheman, 1855 (Hispinae: Cassidini); Syphrea flavicollis (Jacoby, 1884) (Galerucinae: Alticini); and Promecosoma inflatum Lefevre, 1877, and Demotina modesta Baly, 1874 (Eumolpinae), The following new synonymies are proposed: Deloyala clavata, var. diversicollis Schaeffer, 1925, transferred from synonymy with Plagiometriona clavata (Fabricius, 1798) to synonymy with P. clavata testudinaria (Boheman, 1855); Chrysomela hybrida Say, 1824, downgraded from subspecies of Calligrapha lunata (Fabricius, 1787) to full synonym of Calligrapha lunata (Fabricius); Chrysomela casta Rogers, 1856, downgraded from subspecies of Zygogramma suturalis (Fabricius, 1775) to full synonym of Zygogrammasuturalis (Fabricius); Trirhabda gurneyi Blake, 1951, downgraded to synonym of Trirhabda caduca Horn, 1893; Scelida mimula Wilcox, 1965, downgraded to synonym of Scelida nigricomis (Jacoby, 1888); Exoracalifornica Wilcox, 1953, downgraded to synonym of Pteleon brevicornis (Jacoby, 1887); Palaeothona arizonensis Blake, 1950, downgraded to synonym of Lupraea discrepans (Schaeffer,1932); Haltica nigritula Linell, 1898, downgraded to synonym of Nesaecrepida asphaltina (Suffrian, 1868); Cryptocephalus reinhardi Sundman, 1965, downgraded to synonym of Cryptocephalus mutabilis Melsheimer, 1847. The tribes Chalepini Wiese, 1910, and Uroplatini Weise, 1910 (Hispinae), are synonymized, and both of these family-group names are recognized as nomina protecta. The family-group name Octotomites Chapuis, 1875, is recognized as a nomen oblitum, Coptocycla testudinaria Boheman, 1855, is downgraded from specific status to a subspecies of Plagiometriona clavata (Fabricius, 1798); Cassida bicolor (Fabricius, 1798) is recognized as a valid subspecies of Charidotella sexpunctata (Fabricius). The genus Hemiphrynus Horn, 1889, is removed from synonymy with Phrynocepha and reinstated as a valid genus; Rhabdopterus weisei (Schaeffer, 1920) is removed from synonymy with Rhabdopterus praetextus (Say) and reinstated as a valid species. The following new combinations are proposed: Synetocephalus wallacei (Wilcox, 1965), transferred from Pseudoluperus; Nesaecrepida infuscata (Schaeffer, 1906), transferred from Monomacra; Acallepitrix nitens (Horn, 1889), transferred from Epitrix; Margaridisa atriventris (Melsheimer, 1847), transferred from Homaltica; Parchicola iris (Olivier, 1808) and P. tibialis (Olivier, 1808), transferred from Monomacra; and Coleothorpa panochensis (Gilbert, 1981), transferred from Coscinoptera; Promecosoma arizonae (Crotch, 1873), transferred from Metaxyonycha; Tymnes chrysis (Olivier, 1808), T. oregonensis (Crotch, 1873), and T. thaleia (Blake, 1977), transferred from Colaspis. The following new replacement name is proposed: Triarius nigroflavus, for Luperodes flavoniger Blake, 1942 (not Laboissiere, 1925). The identities of Griburius equesiris (Olivier, 1808) and G. laruatus (Newman, 1840) are discussed.

N2  - This study is a contribution to the knowledge of the weevil species present in the State of Guanajuato, Mexico. During this study, 73 genera and 125 species were identified. The subfamilies best represented were Baridinae, Curculioninae and Entiminae with 24, 24 and 23 species, respectively. The genera best represented were Geraeus and Anthonomus with seven species and Conotrachelus with six. Of the 125 species identified, 18 represent new country records. Of the weevil species found in Guanajuato, 53.7% are Neotropical, 26% are Nearctic, 18.4% are cosmopolitan, and the remainder (1.9%) previously were known only from the West Indies.

N2  - Epimechus curvipes Dietz is designated as type species of the genus Epimechus Dietz. Ten additional species from western North America, including four new species, are assigned to the genus: E. aemulus Fall; E. flavirostris Fall; E. mimicus Dietz; E. adspersus Dietz; E. mobilis Fall; E. nevadicus Dietz; E. molina, new species (Arizona, Baja California Norte); E. combustus, new species (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah); E. signum, new species (Arizona, Coahuila, Colorado, New Mexico, Saskatchewan, Texas, Utah) and E. hesperius, new species (Arizona, California, Colorado, Guanajuato, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Nuevo Leon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Wyoming). These are distinguished from other Anthonomini by the short, simple tarsal claws. The names Epimechus modicus Fall, E. soriculus Dietz, and E. nanulus Fall are placed in new synonymy under E. curvipes. Lectotypes are designated for E. adspersus and E. nevadicus. Two species formerly in Epimechus are transferred the subgenus Cnemocyllus Dietz in Anthonomus Germar: E. arenicolor Fall as Anthonomus arenicolor (Fall), new combination, and E. canoides Fall as Anthonomus canoides (Fall), new combination. Adults of species of Epimechus have been collected on plants in the genera Baccharis, Chrysothamnus, Ericameria, Gutierrezia, Haplopappue, Senecio and Tetradymia (all Asteraceae).

N2  - The genus Asydates Casey (Coleoptera: Melyridae) is revised, containing three species from Arizona and California: A. explanatus Casey; A. inyoensis (Blaisdell), new combination; and A. rufiventris Casey. The monotypic genus Pseudasydates Blaisdell is placed in synonymy with Asydates Casey, syn. nov., and Asydates puncticeps Blaisdell is placed in synonymy with Asydates explanatus Casey, syn. nov. A key separating adults of Asydates species is provided, and the results of a computerized cladistic analysis of Asydates species are presented. GIS mapping of Asydates species distributions indicates that these species are nearly allopatric, with A. explanatus found in the lower Colorado River basin and adjacent deserts, A. inyoensis restricted to the Inyo and White Mountains, and A. rufiventris found in the coastal plain and coastal mountains near Santa Barbara. Geographic hypotheses of character evolution within Asydates are developed by combining the results of cladistic analysis and GIS mapping.

Both of these species and Ptomaphagus schwarzi Hatch appear to be regular and obligate inhabitants of Geomys burrows but are not host specific. Nemadus hornii Hatch, Sciodrepoides watsoni hornianus (Blanchard), Catops simplex Say, Ptomaphagus cavernicola Schwarz, Ptomaphagus consobrinus (LeConte), Ptomaphagus fisus Horn, and Ptomaphagus texanus Horn were less frequently collected and are probably facultative inhabitants of Geomys burrows, as well as nests or dens of other small mammals. Ptomaphagus nevadicus Horn is an inhabitant of burrows of Thomomys pocket gophers in western North America. A key to the species of Ptomaphagus III the southeastern Gulf Coastal Plain, from non-cave habitats, is provided to aid in their identification.

N2  - Previous treatments ofthe east-Nearctic spirobolid genus Narceus Rafinesque have overlooked the name, N. woodruffi Causey. The holotype is lost, but examinations of a non-typical male and two paratype and three non-typical females show it to be a valid species, perhaps endemic to north Florida, distinguished by its small size and the configurations of the gonopods and coxal lobes of legs 3-6 in males. Supplemental anatomical notes are presented on the non-typical male along with comparative drawings of the lobes and gonopods of N. woodruffi, N. americanus (Beauvois), and N. annularis (Rafinesque); distributions of species of Narceus in Florida are depicted on a map. Substantial size differences between ostensibly conspecific males of N. americanus in Texas and Arkansas suggest that Narceus may be more complex than the current concept of four species.

N2  - A survey of Wisconsin Scarabaeoidea (Coleoptera) conducted from literature searches, collection inventories, and three years of field work (1997-1999), yielded 177 species representing nine families, two of which, Ochodaeidae and Ceratocanthidae, represent new state family records. Fifty-six species (32% of the Wisconsin fauna) represent new state species records, having not previously been recorded from the state. Literature and collection distributional records suggest the potential for at least 33 additional species to occur in Wisconsin.

N2  - The generic and specific composition of the Nearctic jumping spiders of the subfamily Euophryinae north of Mexico is reviewed, and the biogeographic affinities of the constituent groups are diagnosed. The five North American species of Habrocestum are removed from that non-euophryine genus; four are placed in the New Genus Naphrys, type species Habrocestum acerbum Peckham & Peckham 1909, creating the following New Combinations: Naphrys acerba (Peckham & Peckham), Naphrys bufoides (Chamberlin & Ivie 1944), Naphrys pulex (Hentz 1846), and Naphrys xerophila (Richman 1981). The fifth species is not an euophryine, and becomes Chinattus parvulus (Banks 1895), New Combination. Four species placed in the genus Tylogonus, another non-euophryine genus, are removed to the New Genus Mexigonus, type species Sidusa minuta F.O.P.-Cambridge 1901, creating the following New Combinations: Mexigonus arizonensis (Banks 1904),Mexigonus dentichelis (F.O.P.-Cambridge 1901),Mexigonus minutus (F.O.P.-Cambridge), and Mexigonus morosus (Peckham & Peckham 1888). One of the two species of Nearctic Euophrys has been misplaced, and becomes Chalcoscirtus diminutus (Banks 1896), New Combination. New state records are reported for Chalcoscirtus diminutus [Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico], Mexigonus minutus [California], Naphrys acerba [New Mexico], and Pseudeuophrys erratica (Walckenaer 1826) [New York]. Of the eight known euophryine genera with Nearctic representatives, Anasaitis (one species) and Corythalia (two species) are considered Neotropical in origin, whereas Chalcoscirtus (three species), Euophrys (one species), and Talavera (one species) are considered Holarctic. The Palaearctic Pseudeuophrys erratica is introduced. The affinities of the apparently endemic Nearctic Naphrys (four species) and Mexigonus (four species) are uncertain at this time. Although not an euophryine, the presence of a species of Chinattus in eastern North America is biogeographically interesting, as the other species in the genus are Asian; it joins a diversity of taxa with this distribution.

N2  - A list is provided of 113 species of bees and their 157 known floral hosts at the Archbold Biological Station(ABS), a 2105 ha site on the Lake Wales Ridge in Highlands County in south-central Florida. This is more species than might be expected at a single site so far south in Florida, based on previous studies in the Miami area and Everglades National Park, but fewer species than would be expected in an upland area of similar size with open habitats in north Florida, the mid-Atlantic states, or the upper Midwest. The small size of the fauna might be correlated with the absence of species that require a cold period in their life cycle, those that require clay or other heavy soils, those that require mesic woodlands and those that require abundant host plants in certain groups that are poorly represented on the ABS, such as Rosaceae. The natural history of southeastern bees is not known in enough detail to ascribe these causes to the individual species that are missing from the ABS fauna. In terms of bee taxa, the relatively small diversity at this site can be mainly attributed to a very poor representation of the genus Andrena (3 species), a poor representation of the genus Lasioglossum (13 species), and a poor representation of the entire family Apidae (22 species). The bee fauna of the ABS is mostly composed of species that occur (or may be expected to occur) through much of the southeastern Coastal Plain, combined with species that are widely distributed in eastern North America. In addition to these elements, there appear to be at least a few species or populations that may be relics of the dry savannahs that stretched across southern North America in parts of the Pleistocene or in the late Pliocene. There is only one species that appears to have come up from tropical Florida or the West Indies. There is no evidence that there are plants that are dependent on single bee species at the ABS, but certain buzz-pollinated plants may rely on only a few species of Bombus. A few species of bees appear to be oligolectic; their host plants, however, are visited by a wide variety of bees and other insects. Bees at the ABS belong to four conspicuous mimetic complexes: metallic green; black with a red abdomen; black with red bands and spots; black with yellow bands and spots. Most ABS bees do not have any warning coloration that is conspicuous to human eyes. There is only one exotic bee on the site, the European honey bee. This lack of a large exotic component in the fauna contrasts with the situation in the ants, of which about one fourth are introduced. Honey bees are often extremely abundant, and possibly dominate nectar and pollen resources in ways that are disruptive to native bees. Although it is easy to observe individual honey bees displacing individual native bees on flowers, there are no data on the ecological effects of honey bees on native pollinators at the ABS. About one quarter ofthe bee species (26) are parasitic species that depend on other species to gather nectar and pollen. This proportion of parasitic species is similar to some other well-studied sites in temperate North America, and is higher than the proportion found in tropical areas.

High Lepidoptera numbers in Mexico are also due to the large influx of tropical species from the border with Guatemala, as well as Mexican endemics. In this report, the Lepidoptera families are summarized for Mexico, giving known species and what experts estimate to be the true total for each family when all have been described.

Georgiulus Hoffman is placed in synonymy under Pseudojulus; G. hubrichti Hoffman is placed under P.paynei; and A. australis Causey is placed under A. hummi. The genera are sympatric in north Florida and southern Georgia, but Pseudojulus extends northward to coastal South Carolina and south central North Carolina, and westward to Alabama west of Mobile Bay. Both genera belong to the Aniulini and possess unique features; in Pseudojulus the anterior gonopod coxae are fused into a "shelf" on the dorsal surface of the complex that extends ventrad along the caudal margin and possesses a pair of posterior median syncoxal lobes or laminas of varying lengths and configurations. Arvechambus exhibits a suite of apomorphies and is sister to the rest of the tribe collectively: the 8th sternum possesses elevated lateral lobes that overhang the sides of the gonopodal aperture; the 7th pleurotergite possesses lobes that also overlie the sides of the aperture; the anterior gonopods lack lateral syncoxal processes, the coxal lobes, much larger than in other tribal genera, arise laterad and obscure part of the telopodite in anterior view, and the telopodite is elongate rather than clavate; and the 2nd pleurotergite in females possesses lobes that overhang and effectively close the cyphopodal aperture.

A lectotype designation is published for Apion meorrhynchum Philippi and Philippi and Apion vestitum Philippi and Philippi. Apion fuegianum Enderlein and A. pingue Beguin-Billecocq are synonymized with N. meorrhynchum (Philippi and Philippi), new synonymy. Noterapionini (new tribe) is erected for Noterapion Kissinger (type genus) within Apioninae. Extension of a phylogenetic analysis of Brentidae s. lato by Wanat (2001) places Noterapion near the base of Apioninae and shows the genus sharing various symplesiomorphies with primitive apionid subfamilies from Africa and not found otherwise in the New World apionids. The weevils are associated with the southern beech, Nothofagus Blume (in Nothofagaceae, see Manos, 1997), also known from the Australasian Region. Noterapion meorrhynchurn develops in abandoned cynipid wasp leaf galls. The combination of a plant host with biogeographic significance and the possession of very primitive characters suggests that Noterapion may represent an ancient lineage dating back to the time of the Cretaceous and the breakup of Gondwana.

N2  - The genera of the tribe Brontini (Silvanidae: Brontinae) are reviewed. The tribe is considered here to be composed of 12 genera, Uleiota Latreille, Brontopriscus Sharp, and Dendrophagus SchÃ¯Â¿Â½nherr, plus nine new genera: Australodendrophagus, Australohyliota, Brontoliota, Dendrophagella, Macrohyliota, Megahyliota, Microhyliota, Parahyliota, and Protodendrophagus. Aplatamus Grouvelle is removed from the Brontini and placed in the Telephanini. Four new species are described: Protodendrophagus antipodes Thomas; Brontoliota indivisipennis Thomas; Brontoliota intermedius Thomas; and Brontoliota monteithi Thomas. Described species are assigned to genera with the following new combinations resulting: Australodendrophagus australis (Erichson); Australohyliota chilensis (Blanchard); Australohyliota macleayi (Olliff); Denrophagella capito (Pascoe); Macrohyliota truncatipennis (Heller); Macrohyliota bicolor Arrow; Macrohyliota gracilicornis (Arrow); Macrohyliota lucius (Pascoe); Macrohyliota militaris (Erichson); Macrohyliota spinicollis (Gory); Megahyliota feae (Grouvelle); Microhyliota integricollis (Fairmaire); Parahyliota africanus Grouvelle; Parahyliota alticola (Pal, Sen Gupta, and Crowson); Parahyliota atratus (Grouvelle); Parahyliota brevicollis (Arrow); Parahyliota cinamomeus (Fairmaire); Parahyliota costicollis (Reitter); Parahyliota fallax (Grouvelle); Parahyliota indicus (Arrow); Parahyliota pallidus (Arrow); Parahyliota puberulus (Reitter); Parahyliota serratus (Smith); Parahyliota serricollis (Candeze); Parahyliota siamensis (Arrow). Two new synonymies are proposed: Uleiota crenicollis Grouvelle (=Uleiota costicollis Grouvelle) and Uleiota texana Dajoz (=Uleiota dubius (Fabricius)). Uleiota truncatus Motschulsky, formerly treated as a subspecies of U. dubius (Fabricius), is elevated to a full species, new status.

Anastrepha caudata Stone 1942 is redescribed based on the holotype, the only known specimen. Its type locality is probably SÃ¯Â¿Â½o Paulo de OlivenÃ¯Â¿Â½a in Amazonas, Brazil, not the state or city of SÃ¯Â¿Â½o Paulo as previously assumed. Anastrepha hendeliana Lima 1934, new status, is removed from synonymy with A. longicauda Lima 1934 based on specimens from Brazil (Amazonas and Rondonia) and Colombia (CaquetÃ¯Â¿Â½).

For the homonyms, the following new names are proposed: Aplocnemus montbabor Mayor,newname, forA. baborensis Pic 1922; Dasytes loboensis Mayor,newname,forD. nevadensis Pic 1954; DasytesminorMayor,newname, forD.minutusCasey1895;Amalthocuspici Mayor,newname, forA. metallicus (Pic 1955); Attalus tribandipennis Mayor, new name, for A. tricoloripennis Pic 1927; Attalus ulkei Mayor, new name, forA. laevicollis(Horn1872);LaiuscephalusMayor,newname, forL.verticalisFairmaire;Sphinginopalpus mpumalangaensis Mayor new name for S. nigriceps Wittmer 1994; Sphinginopalpus rufinotus Mayor, new name, for S. rufithorax Wittmer 1994. Scelopristis Mayor new genus, is proposed for the species of Pristocelis LeConte 1862, a junior synonym of Trichochrous Motschulsky 1860; the available name Hadrocnemus Kraatz 1895 is proposed for the species of Apalochrus Erichson 1840 a senior objective synonym of Paritinus Abeille de Perrin 1891.Thefollowingnewsubjectivesynonymsare proposed: PristoscelisLeConte1862isajuniorsynonym of Trichochrous Motschulsky 1860; Anthocomus (Paremballus) Abeille de Perrin 1891 is a junior synonym of Anthocomus (Anthocomus) Erichson 1840; Anthocomus (Neotrotus) Abeille de Perrin 1891 is a juniorsynonymof Anthocomus(Celidus)MulsantandRey1867; AmanicollopsPic1908isajuniorsynonymofHadrocnemusKraatz 1895. Paratinus Abeille de Perrin 1891 is a junior objective synonym of Apalochrus Erichson 1840). New combinations forNorthAmericanspecies fromAttalus Erichson,AnthocomusErichson,Microlipus LeConteand Tanaops LeConte formalized here were suggested by Mayor (2002). The Characters indicating the close relationship of Neadasytes Hatch 1962 to Dasytastes Casey 1895, and of Paradasytes Hatch 1962 to Dasytellus Casey 1895 are discussed. Afrocolotes Wittmer 1960 and Olistherarthrus Champion 1922, listed as synonyms of Temnopsophus Horn 1872 by Evers (1989: 6), are here considered distinct genera. These changes are proposed here so that they can be included in a world catalog in preparation.

First instars are distinguished from other species of Lecanodiaspis by the arrangement of dorsal 8-shaped pores in six complete longitudinal rows and a partial row in the thoracic region and the number of labial, anal plate, and spiracular setae. Second instars are dimorphic with males possessing well developed 5-segmented legs, dorsal tubular ducts, and long hair-like setae on the venter between the antennae and on the abdominal segments. Females have fewer 8-shaped pores in transverse rows on the dorsum, as well as legs reduced to stubs and only one pair of hair-like medial setae on the venter.

N2  - A three-year survey of Wisconsin Mordellidae (Coleoptera) encompassing a compilation of data from literature records and local collections as well as field work including trapping, hand-collecting, and rearing yielded 68 species comprising 14 genera in three tribes. Sixty-three species (92% of Wisconsin fauna) represent new state species records, not previously recorded from the state in the literature. Plant-associations and state- specific temporal and spatial distribution data for larvae and adults are noted as available. Distributional records suggest 16 additional species and one additional genus are likely to occur in Wisconsin.

N2  - Labium is a primitive transantarctic genus which parasitizes ground-nesting halictid bees and until now has been known only from the Australian Region. Diagnostic features include its large exposed labrum (as long as clypeus) ; elongate mandible with upper tooth much shorter and smaller than lower tooth; slender 1st gastric tergite with spiracle distad of middle; and short, concealed ovipositor which is slender, depressed, and without notch or nodus. Labium wahli is now described from south Brazilian rain forest. It differs from the Australian species by its longer flagellum which is only slightly thickened apicad and because it has no crests at base of the notauli

N2  - Through collecting, surveys of museum collections, and search of the literature, we are able to list 181 species of Pentatomidae as occurring within the boundaries of the Republic of Honduras. Most of these, 129, around 70%, are widespread in the American tropics. Twenty-nine species are new country records, reported for Honduras for the first time. Four species of pentatomids are endemic to Honduras including a new genus and species of ochlerine (Discocephalinae) herein described. Although a few species extend from South America into Honduras (the Gondwanan element), and a few from North America extend into Honduras (the Nearctic element), the most important faunal element is one which is native to nuclear Central America.

The species of Anthonomus in the subgenus Cnemocyllus are distinguished from other Anthonomini by the combination of having vestiture of more-or-less broad, dense scales, 6 or 7 antennal funicular articles, a slender endophallic transfer apparatus and, in most, the slightly to strongly curved metatibia of the male. The tarsal claws are variable, toothed or untoothed. The names Anthonomus cycliferus (Fall), A. malkini Hatch and A. summeri Hatch are placed in new synonymy under A. jacobinus Dietz; A. cretaceus (Champion) is placed in new synonymy under A. decipiens LeConte; A. imbricus Hatch is placed in new synonymy under A. quesnelensis Sleeper; A. mannerheimi Dieckmann (A. brunnipennis Mannerheim, not Curtis) and A. subvittatus LeConte are placed in new synonymy under A. inermis (Boheman); A. minutus Hatch is placed in new synonymy under A. dorothyae Hatch. Adults of many of the species of the subgenus Cnemocyllus have been collected on plants in the family Asteraceae. The larvae of several of the species are known to develop on these plants.

N2  - A preliminary annotated checklist of the Chrysomelidae of the Baja California peninsula, Mexico is presented based on literature records and the examination of approximately 16,000 chrysomelid specimens. Seven subfamilies and 218 described species have been identified. Ninty-one species are recognized from the Baja California peninsula for the first time. Twenty-nine species are listed as endemic. An additional 128 morphospecies have been identified as undescribed or not yet associated with described species of mainland Mexico or the United States. Adult host plant associations have been identified for approximately 120 species or 35% of the leaf beetle fauna of the region. Each of the 218 described species is associated with the eight plant communities as outlined by Wiggins (1980). Two dominant subfamilies comprise 76% of the leaf beetle fauna: Galerucinae, 87 species (40%) and Cryptocephalinae, 78 species (36%). The following new combinations are proposed: Neolema californica (Heinze, 1927), transferred from Lema Fabricius, 1798; Pseudoluperus histrio (Horn, 1895), transferred from Keitheatus Wilcox, 1965, and Diachus peninsularis (Schaeffer, 1906), transferred from Triachus J. L. LeConte, 1880. Lema peninsulae Crotch, 1873, is removed from synonymy with L. balteata J. L. LeConte, 1884 and reinstated as a valid species. A replacement name is proposed: Longitarsus bajaensis Andrews and Gilbert for Longitarsus bicolor Horn, 1894.

N2  - A total of 73 species of tephritid flies has been recorded from Florida since the early 1800s. Of these, 7 species are considered to represent occasional waifs or accidental introductions from surrounding regions that are not known to have established populations in Florida; 6 are exotic pests which failed to colonize or were extirpated; and 7 species are represented only by early literature records and are considered dubious for the state. Thus, the tephritid fauna of Florida currently comprises a total of 53 species of which 1 species is precinctive to the state and considered to be endangered.

N2  - The name Araecerus fasciculatus (DeGeer 1775) is resurrected for the coffee bean weevil, with the following synonyms: Bruchus cacao Fabricius 1775, Bruchus peregrinus Herbst 1797, Bruchus capsinicola Fabricius 1798, Anthribus coffeae Fabricius 1801, Amblycerus japonicus Thunberg 1815 (probably a synonym), Anthribus alternans Germar 1824, Phloeobius griseus of Stephens 1831, not Fabricius 1792, Cratoparis parvirostris Thomson 1858, Araecerus seminarius Chevrolat 1871, and Tropideres (Rhaphitropis) mateui Cobos 1954. Lectotypes are designated for A. fasciculatus, B. capsinicola, and A. alternans. A diagnosis distinguishes Araecerus from all 650 anthribid genera and a diagnosis for the species is as complete as possible with materials studied. Some additional species of Araecerus are discussed: Bruchus crassicornis Fabricius 1798 is distinguished from A. fasciculatus and a lectotype is designated. Araecerus suturalis Boheman 1839 is diagnosed and shown to be dissimilar from the species recently reported as A. suturalis from South Africa. The identity of Araecerus suturalis of Frieser, not Boheman, is not yet clear. Araecerus sambucinus Boisduval 1835 and Trepideres [sic] fragilis Walker 1859 may be synonyms of A. fasciculatus but pertinent data are insufficient. Brachytarsus niveovariegatus Roelofs 1879 (spelled nigrovariegatus by Bovie (1906)), listed as a synonym of A. fasciculatus by Wolfrurn (1929) is removed to Anthribus Forster 1770 with Anthribus lajievorus Chao 1976 as a new synonym.

N2  - Habronyx Foerster occurs in all regions except the Afrotropical and parasitizes lepidopterous larvae (Geometridae, Noctuidae, Saturniidae, Sphingidae, Psychidae). Habronyx albifrons (Spinola) inhabits neantartic Chile and southern Argentina. It is black with a white flagellar annulus and with a strong prepectal carina on the lower half of the mesopleuron. Habronyx albifrons is redescribed and descriptions are given of two new species which belong to a group of their own: Habronyx citrinus Porter, n. sp., from central Chile; and Habronyx punensis Porter, n. sp., from the high Andean steppe of Bolivia, where it attacks noctuid larvae on Chenopodium quinoa Willd. These differ from H. albifrons because the prepectal carina is absent on the mesopleuron, being developed only on the mesosternum, and because they have the flagellum uniformly black and the gaster extensively orange. Habronyx punensis differs from H. citrinus in having a sharp carina on the front, the mesopleural punctures not reticulately confluent, the discoidella weaker and in part desclerotized.

N2  - The checkered beetle genera Parvochaetus, n. gen. and Amboakis, n. gen. are described and the genus Ellipotoma Spinola is reviewed. Four new species plus P. linearis (Gorham), which represents a new combination, comprise Parvochaetus: P. albicornis, P. froeschneri, P. fucolatus, and P. sandaracus. Amboakis, a replacement name for the junior homonym Teutonia Opitz, involves four previously described species and 20 new species. The new species are A. anapsis, A. atra, A. barinas, A. binotonis, A. cauca, A. charis, A. epiomidia, A. erythrohapsis, A. funebris, A. incondita, A. katatonis, A. linitis, A. mica, A. micula, A. prolata, A. rudis, A. taruma, A. selva, A. stenosis, and A. vesca. Four previously described species now classified under Amboakis involve new combinations; they are Epiphloeus capitatus Gorham, Epiphloeus nitidus Gorham, Phlogistosternus flavicollis Zayas, and Teutonia nova Opitz. The bitypic Ellipotoma contains E. tenuiformis Spinola and E. turmalis, n. sp. Lectotypes are designated for Epiphloeus capitatus Gorham, Apolopha linearis Gorham, Epiphloeus nitidus Gorham, and Ellipotoma tenuiformis Spinola. Parvochaetus specimens may be distinguished from Amboakis and Ellipotoma specimens by the extraordinarily slender antennal club. The expanded condition of the funicular antennomeres will separate specimens of Parvochaetus and Amboakis from those of Madoniella. Specimens of the bitypic genus Ellipotoma are very slender in body form and the elytral disk is devoid of secondary (2o) setae. These features will easily separate Ellipotoma specimens from those of Madoniella. On the basis of adult external morphology Parvochaetus and Amboakis may be conveniently organized into monophyletic species groups, 5 in Parvochaetus and 9 in Amboakis. Descriptions of the alimentary canal of Amboakis nova (Opitz) and of the stomodaeal valves of A. nova and Ellipotoma tenuiformis Spinola are provided and serve as basic data for subsequent analyses involving higher categories. The alimentary canal involves a well-differentiated stomodaeum, ventriculus, and proctodaeum. The ventricular papillae are poorly developed and there are 4 cryptonephridial Malpighian tubules. The stomodaeal valve is comprised of 4 primary lobes with the lateral lobes longer and more slender than shorter dorsal and ventral lobes; the ventral lobe is particularly broad. The male internal reproductive organs are characterized by having two pairs of accessory glands with the medial being longer than the lateral. A well-developed spermatheca and saccular bursa copulatrix are important features of the female internal organs. Species descriptions, a key to species, and biological information are included. These checkered beetles are diurnal, considerably active flyers, and are predators of lignicolous insects and particularly of bark beetles. Included is a discourse of species level and supraspecific level discontinuities. Differences in the aedeagus, antennae, body form, presence or absence of 2o setae, and arrangement of punctations on the elytral disc were important characters in the discernment of species. Forty characters of Parvochaetus, Amboakis, and Ellipotoma and their states were polarized to hypothesize intergeneric relationships and intrageneric relationships of Parvochaetus and Amboakis. Hennigian principles of phylogenetic analysis were implemented to prepare two trees. The predominant distribution of Parvochaetus, Amboakis, and Ellipotoma taxa in South America suggests that the progenitor of these genera may have existed on that continent with subsequent dispersal and vicariant events distributing species throughout Middle America and onto islands of the Greater Antilles. Pre-Tertiary South American diversification produced 3 ancestral stocks, each of which fostered lineages that migrated northward via the proto-Antillean Archipelago across the isthmanian closure of the late Tertiary. These temporal frameworks, paleographic dispersals, and vicariant events would explain the presence of relatively primitive, and derived Amboakis elements in Mexico

N2  - The beetle fauna of the island of Dominica is summarized. It is presently known to contain 269 genera, and 361 species (in 42 families), of which 347 are named at a species level. Of these, 62 species are endemic to the island. The other naturally occurring species number 262, and another 23 species are of such wide distribution that they have probably been accidentally introduced and distributed, at least in part, by human activities. Undoubtedly, the actual numbers of species on Dominica are many times higher than now reported. This highlights the poor level of knowledge of the beetles of Dominica and the Lesser Antilles in general. Of the species known to occur elsewhere, the largest numbers are shared with neighboring Guadeloupe (201), and then with South America (126), Puerto Rico (113), Cuba (107), and Mexico-Central America (108). The Antillean island chain probably represents the main avenue of natural overwater dispersal via intermediate stepping-stone islands. The distributional patterns of the species shared with Dominica and elsewhere in the Caribbean suggest stages in a dynamic taxon cycle of species origin, range expansion, distribution contraction, and re-speciation.

N2  - Generic placement of Nearctic species of Ochodaeinae has lagged behind changes in generic concepts in the group. In order to place Nearctic species into the appropriate genus-level taxa, several nomenclatural changes are made. The new generic name Xenochodaeus is proposed for species with an elongate, subparallel sulcus on the propygidium and a longitudinally impressed mentum. The genus contains 6 species. Xenochodaeus americanus (Westwood), new combination, is valid and is removed from synonymy with X. musculus (Say), new combination. A neotype is designated for Odontaeus musculus. Ochodaeus opacus LeConte is synonymized under X. americanus. Other new combinations include Xenochodaeus luscinus (Howden), X. planifrons (Schaeffer), X. simplex (LeConte), and X. ulkei (Horn). The new generic name Cucochodaeus is proposed for species having the propygidial sulcus absent, stridulatory peg absent, and possessing 9 antennomeres. The genus contains 1 species, C. sparsus (LeConte), new combination. Ochodaeus mandibularis Linell is placed into synonymy with C. sparsus. Ochodaeus gnatho Fall is transferred to the genus Codocera Eschscholtz, resulting in C. gnatho (Fall), new combination. Two new combinations result from Nearctic species transferred to Neochodaeus Nikolajev: N. repandus (Fall) and N. striatus (LeConte). Three Nearctic species are transferred to Parochodaeus Nikolajev, resulting in new combinations: Parochodaeus californicus (Horn), P. duplex (LeConte), and P. peninsularis (Horn). A lectotype is designated for Ochodaeus kansanus Fall, and that same specimen is designated as the neotype of Ochodaeus duplex (LeConte), objectively synonymizing O. kansanus with O. duplex. A checklist of Nearctic species and key to Nearctic genera are provided.

N2  - Six new genera are erected as follows: in the Issini, Argepara gen. n. (type species: Hysteropterum semipellucidum Melichar, 1906), Aztecus gen. n. (type species: Hysteropterum montezuma Kirkaldy, 1913), Incasa gen. n. (type species: Hysteropterum riobambae Schmidt, 1910), Bumaya gen. n. (type species: Bumaya knorozovi sp. n.); and in the Colpopterini, Caudibeccus, gen. n. (type species: Colpoptera carlota Myers, 1928) and Jamaha gen. n. (type species: Poeciloptera elevans Walker, 1858). Four new generic synomymies are proposed: Prothona Caldwell, 1945 and Plummerana Caldwell, 1945 are placed in synonymy under Proteinissus Fowler, 1904. Thionissa Metcalf, 1938 is placed in synonymy under Dracela Signoret, 1861. Hesperophara Kirkaldy, 1904 is placed in synonymy under Colpoptera Burmeister, 1835. Twenty-three new combinations resulting from generic synonymies or transfer of species into new genera are: Argepara lyra (Berg, 1883), Argepara semipellucida (Melichar, 1906), Aztecus auroriferus (Caldwell, 1945), Aztecus erratus (Caldwell, 1945), Aztecus mexicanus (Kirkaldy, 1909), Aztecus montezuma (Kirkaldy, 1913), Aztecus sierrae (Fowler, 1904), Aztecus viridatus (Caldwell, 1945), Caudibeccus carlota (Myers, 1928), Caudibeccus lucaris (Fennah, 1955), Caudibeccus meleagris (Fennah, 1955), Caudibeccus punctatus (Metcalf, 1954), Colpoptera rustica (Fabricius, 1803), Dracela acuta (Metcalf, 1938), Incasa riobambae (Schmidt, 1910), Jamaha chrysops (Fennah, 1955), Jamaha elevans (Walker 1858), Paralixes fowleri (Melichar, 1906), Proteinissus isolatus (Caldwell, 1945), Proteinissus pentagonatus (Caldwell, 1945), Proteinissus punctatus (Caldwell, 1945), Proteinissus reticulatus (Caldwell, 1945), Proteinissus viridus (Caldwell, 1945). Three new species are described: Bumaya knorozovi sp. n. from Belize and Mexico, Traxus kasparyani sp. n. from Mexico, and Caudibeccus emeljanovi sp. n. from Cuba. The description of T. kasparyani represents the first Mexican country record for the genus Traxus Metcalf. The species Hysteropterum acanthum Caldwell, 1945 is placed in synonymy under Aztecus montezuma (Kirkaldy, 1913). Colpoptera sinuata Burmeister, 1835 is redescribed. New country records are presented for A. semipellucida from Argentina, A. lyra from Paraguay and Uruguay, D. acuta from Ecuador, and D. annulipes Signoret, 1861 from Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador. Keys to the species of the genera Aztecus gen. n., Argepara gen. n., Traxus Metcalf, and Dracela Signoret are given. An ant association is recorded for the first time for A. lyra.

An annotated catalog and information about the origin and distributional patterns are also provided. Thirty-nine species of bees occur in Puerto Rico and adjacent islands. This fauna is composed of four elements: exclusive Puerto Rican endemics (26.5%); Antillean endemics occurring on multiple islands (76.5%); continental species that have also colonized the Antilles (23.5%); and species introduced through human activity (12.8%). Thebee fauna was both low in its diversity and showed the highest level of disharmony in relation to other faunas of the Greater Antilles. A lectotype is here designated for Agapostemon krugii Wolcott, 1936.

N2  - The Tetragonoderus (Peronoscelis) quadriguttatus assemblage is a postulated monophyletic part of the intersectus complex. This assemblage is characterized against a background that includes review of a classification of the genus and comparison, in the form of a key, to other unrelated Western Hemisphere genera that share elongate tibial spurs with Tetragonoderus Dejean. The principal, easily observed feature that unites the three members (T. laevigatus Chaudoir, 1876; T. deuvei, new species (type locality: Cuijaba, Mato Grosso, Brazil), and T. quadriguttatus Dejean) of the quadriguttatus assemblage is the four-spotted elytra (two spots per elytron). These species are treated in detail, including key, synonymy (as required), comparisons, description (external and male genitalic features), habitat (if known), locality data, and geographical range map. Also, T. subfasciatus Putzeys, 1846, the elytral color pattern of whose members may be confused with the spotted pattern of the quadriguttatus assemblage, is treated similarly. The following new synonymies were established: T. quadriguttatus Dejean 1829 = T. columbicus Steinheil 1875 = T. lacordairei Chaudoir 1876 = T. tetragrammus Chaudoir 1876; and T. laevigatus Chaudoir 1876 = T. chaudoiri Liebke 1928 (replacement name for the junior homonym, T. unicolor Chaudoir, 1876). Lectotypes are designated for T. unicolor Chaudoir, T. lacordairei Chaudoir, and T. subfasciatus Putzeys. A neotype is designated for T. quadriguttatus Dejean. New distribution records in the West Indies for T. quadriguttatus are recorded for the islands of Grand Cayman, Jamaica and Hispaniola. These records may be the result of recent natural overseas dispersal from northern South America, or they may be the result of human-mediated accidental introduction, or a combination of both. The southern Floridian (Nearctic) records for T. laevigatus probably represent a recent accidental introduction through commerce, followed by dispersal through flights of adults.

N2  - Classificatory changes are made for some taxa of New World Melolonthinae based on the examination of specimens (including type specimens) and a reevaluation of some of the characters used to justify previous classification decisions. Blepharotoma angustata (Blanchard) (new combination) is transferred from the genus Aplodema Blanchard. The Neotropical members of the genus Heteronyx Guerin-Meneville are transferred to the genus Blepharotoma resulting in the following new combinations: Blepharotoma boliviana (Moser), Blepharotoma corumbana (Moser), Blepharotoma cuyabana (Moser), Blepharotoma heynei (Moser), and Blepharotoma schencklingi (Moser). The genus Blepharotoma is transferred from the tribe Liparetrini to the tribe Sericoidini. The genus Aplodema and the junior synonym Haplodema Harold are transferred from the tribe Liparetrini to the tribe Sericoidini and synonymized with the genus Sericoides Guerin-Meneville. Sericoides magellanica (Blanchard) (new combination) is transferred from the genus Aplodema and placed as a senior synonym of Apterodema acuticollis Fairmaire (new synonymy). Ampliodactylus (new genus) is described for two southern South American species: Ampliodactylus marmoratus (Curtis) (new combination) and Ampliodactylus vestitus (Philippi) (new combination). The genus Chremastodus Solier is placed in synonymy with the genus Macrodactylus Dejean (Macrodactylini) and Chremastodus pubescens Solier is placed as a junior synonym of Macrodactylus chilensis Solier (new synonymy).

Label data indicate that both species are associated with semi- cultivated betel palm (Areca catechu L., Arecaceae) and human mediated dispersal is suggested to have influenced their present-day distribution. Herein, we provide a diagnosis for Platytenes and redescribe its type species, P. varius Pascoe. We also describe P. occultus Setliff and Larson, a new species from the Solomon Islands. New host and locality records are provided, including the first records of the genus occurring on Ambon Island, the Bismarck Archipelago, D'Entrecasteaux Islands, and many previously unreported localities on New Guinea.

N2  - Thirteen species of skippers (six newly described; Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae: Hesperiinae: Hesperiini) from higher elevations of Mexico and Central America are reviewed. These are included in four genera (one newly described), some with proposed new combinations. Onespa Steinhauser, 1974, originally described as monotypic, is shown to include three species in addition to its type species, Onespa nubis Steinhauser, 1974. One of these, Atrytone gala Godman, 1900, that has been misplaced in several genera since its description, represents a new combination. The other two species, distributed in montane habitats in northwestern Mexico and in Costa Rica, are described as new. Buzyges Godman, 1900, distributed in Mexico and Central America and also formerly considered monotypic, is shown to embrace four species. Besides the type species, Buzyges idothea Godman, 1900, two species long placed in Poanes Scudder, 1872, Pamphila rolla Mabille, 1883, and Poanes benito Freeman, 1979, are included as new combinations. Another species, known only from Costa Rica, is described as new. These are united by several superficial characters, but especially by genital morphology of both sexes. Librita Evans, 1955, was described to include three species of which one, Librita raspa Evans, 1955, was subsequently removed. Augiades heras Godman, 1900 is here also removed from Librita and placed in a new genus with three previously undescribed species. This completes the disintegration of Librita, which is now monotypic. The four genera, although exhibiting similarities suggesting potential alliance, differ in their unique combinations of several superficial and genital traits from each other and other hesperiine skippers.

N2  - Geographic variation and subspecific taxonomy of United States populations of the tiger beetle Cicindela obsoleta Say are reviewed. Study of primary types and 1,424 museum specimens indicates that four subspecific entities are present in the U.S., for which the valid names are C. o. obsoleta Say, C. o. santaclarae Bates, C. o. vulturina LeConte, and C. o. neojuvenilis Vogt. All four subspecies are illustrated, including many color variants. ArcView Geographic Information System (GIS) computer software is used to study the distribution of these subspecies in the United States. Cicindela o. obsoleta and C. o. santaclarae are only partially allopatric, with extensive areas in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas where their distributions overlap. Specimens intermediate in their elytral markings between C. o. obsoleta and C. o. santaclarae are reported from localities in New Mexico and Texas where these two subspecies co-occur. In contrast, C. o. vulturina and C. o. neojuvenilis are largely allopatric and show little intergradation with the C. o. obsoleta - C. o. santaclarae complex. It has been suggested recently that disjunct (but as yet unnamed) populations of C. o. vulturina in Missouri and Arkansas may represent a separate subspecies of C. obsoleta. However, the color and elytral pattern characteristics which have been interpreted as diagnostic features of these disjunct populations are also found in many Texas populations of C. o. vulturina, suggesting that the Arkansas and Missouri populations do not merit recognition as a separate subspecies on the basis of these characters alone.

It is also the fourth known amber species, the second Miocene fossil species, the second fossil species in the subfamily Syndesinae, and the first species (fossil or extant) of Lucanidae from the entire Caribbean. It is especially interesting because it is a member of the Australasian genus Syndesus MacLeay. Other such disjunct Dominican amber insect fossils are also discussed.

N2  - The fauna of Phanaeini of the northeast of Brazil was investigated through fieldwork in the States of Ceará, Maranhão and Piauí, and through study of preserved material from other states. Seven species of Phanaeini are newly recorded from these three states. Of these, two species are also new records for the northeast region: Phanaeus melibaeus Blanchard and an unidentified Dendropaemon Perty species. A total of 13 new state records are given for eight of the 15 species of Phanaeini recorded from the northeast to date, including three new state genus records. A key is provided for identification of all species. Detailed distributional information is presented together with habitat and bait preferences and other ecological data for each species. The diversity and distribution of the tribe in the northeast is discussed in the context of regional biotopes and wider geographic ranges. The fauna is shown to be more diverse than previously believed, containing both endemic and widespread elements occurring in species assemblages that differ according to habitat type and elevation, leading to substantial complementarity of diversity amongst the main biogeographic provinces and biotopes of the region.

N2  - First discovered in 1934 and described as a variety of Cicindela abdominalis Fabricius (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae), the form floridana, to our knowledge, has not been recollected until we discovered it in 2007, south of the presumed type locality. From our examination of the type specimen, eight paratypes and 40 specimens from the new locality and additional study, we reinterpreted its status to be a full species. This interpretation is based on distinctive and consistent differences from the closely related Cicindelidia scabrosa (Schaupp). These differences include morphology (maculation, color and elytral microsculpture), distribution, habitat, and seasonality. We present here a more detailed description of this species within the genus Cicindelidia Rivalier, following Rivalier and Wiesner becoming Cicindelidia floridana (Cartwright) new combination.

N2  - Saba Island (Caribbean Netherlands) is one of the northernmost islands of the Lesser Antilles. It is only 13 square kilometers but contains a wide variety of potential spider habitats including dry, moist, and elfin forests. As part of a collaborative effort between Conservation International and Saba Conservation Foundation, during a several week period in March and May 2008 we briefly surveyed the island for spiders and other arthropods. This survey, the first for spiders of Saba, resulted in the identification of 18 families and 76 spider species, including six new species that will be described elsewhere and may be endemic to Saba. The species richness of Saba’s spider fauna is considerably higher than that reported from other small Caribbean islands. We conclude this is probably a combined result of undersampling and lower habitat diversity on these other islands.

N2  - Among the four oriental genera of the tribe Helluonini, Omphra Dejean (Coleoptera: Carabidae), is unique for its endemism to the Indian subcontinent and aptery. High intraspecies variability in morphological characters and limited diagnostic information makes species differentiation of the genus Omphra a complicated task. The present study provides a description of a new species, Omphra drumonti n. sp. from the Western Ghats, redescriptions and a key to the species of Omphra, details of intraspecies variation, discussion of relationships between taxa and distributional patterns of the genus. Based on the distributional patterns in the Indian subcontinent and flightlessness of the genus, inability to cross the physical barrier of the Ganges&ndash;Brahmaputra delta between north and peninsular India is indicated as the reason for its absence in the northeastern Indian subcontinent and endemism to the lower Indian subcontinent.

Coupled with the published locality of E. leachii in Phillips Co., at the southern extremity of the Ridge, the only known occurrences of both the genus and species in Arkansas and west of the Mississippi River are in this physiographic feature. The Arkansas population is geographically peripheral but anatomically intermediate between the two recognized subspecies, E. l. leachii and E. l. fraternus Hoffman, 1978, and we do not assign it to a race. Molecular investigations seem necessary to resolve relationships in the &ldquo;E. leachii complex.&rdquo;

N2  - The Caribbean Islands (or the West Indies) are recognized as one of the leading global biodiversity hot spots. This is based on data on species, genus, and family diversity for vascular plants and non-marine vertebrates. This paper presents data on genus level endemicity for the most speciose (but less well publicised) group of terrestrial animals: the beetles, with 205 genera (in 25 families) now recognized as being endemic (restricted) to the West Indies. The predominant families with endemic genera are Cerambycidae (41), Chrysomelidae (28), Curculionidae (26), and Staphylinidae (25). This high level of beetle generic endemicity can be extrapolated to suggest that a total of about 700 genera of all insects could be endemic to the West Indies. This far surpasses the total of 269 endemic genera of all plants and non-marine vertebrates, and reinforces the biodiversity richness of the insect fauna of the West Indies.Las islas del Caribe (o Indias Occidentales) son reconocidas como uno de los principales hotspots de la biodiversidad global. Esto se basa en datos sobre la diversidad de especies, g&eacute;neros y familias de plantas vasculares y vertebrados no-marinos. Este trabajo presenta datos sobre la endemicidad a nivel gen&eacute;rico para el m&aacute;s especioso (pero menos popularizado) grupo de animales terrestres: los escarabajos, con 205 g&eacute;neros (en 25 familias) reconocidos al presente como end&eacute;micos (restringidos) a las Indias Occidentales. Las familias predominantes en g&eacute;neros end&eacute;micos son Cerambycidae (41), Chrysomelidae (28), Curculionidae (26) y Staphylinidae (25). Este alto nivel de endemicidad gen&eacute;rica en los escarabajos puede extrapolarse a sugerir que alrededor de 700 g&eacute;neros pudieran ser end&eacute;micos entre todos los insectos de las Indias Occidentales. Esto sobrepasa ampliamente el total de 269 g&eacute;neros end&eacute;micos de plantas y vertebrados no-marinos y refuerza la riqueza en biodiversidad de la fauna de insectos en las Indias Occidentales.

N2  - Bactrocera latifrons (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae) infests fruits and vegetables of a number of different plant species, with host plants primarily found in the plant families Solanaceae and Cucurbitaceae. Although B. latifrons is of primarily Asian distribution (e.g., Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Burma, China [Fujian, Yunnan, Hong Kong, Hainan], Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Brunei), its range has expanded through introductions into Hawaii, Okinawa, Tanzania, and Kenya, and poses a threat of introduction into other countries where it does not presently occur. As with other tephritid fruit fly species, establishment of B. latifrons can have significant economic consequences, including damage and loss of food production, as well as requirements for implementation of costly quarantine treatments to permit export of commodities susceptible to infestation by B. latifrons. In order to avoid these adverse economic consequences, one needs to prevent the entry, establishment and spread of B. latifrons into a new habitat. To successfully achieve this, an accurate knowledge of the fly’s host plants is essential. Cognizant of this need, we prepared, and present here, a worldwide list of host plants for B. latifrons, with annotations on reported laboratory and field infestation data. Overall, a total of 59 plant species from 14 plant families are identified as hosts of B. latifrons, based on reported field infestation data.

N2  - Retournement or turning of the aedeagus about its longitudinal axis through about 180o during development is known in Chrysomeloidea (Coleoptera). This change in the orientation of the organ may be observed during the postembryonic development. This change produces certain morphological effects. By observing these morphological features in the imago the retournement may be inferred. Such morphological features in Curculionidae (Coleoptera) are here recorded. From this it has been inferred not only that retournement of the aedeagus is included in the ontogeny of curculionids, but also that the change of orientation of the organ occurs by the same mechanism as in Chrysomeloidea. These inferences attest the notion of a close phyletic relationship between the superfamilies Curculionoidea and Chrysomeloidea.

In Uleiota debilis (LeConte), allogrooming recipients were either stationary or moved away during the acts, without solicitation or facilitation. In Nausibius major Zimmermann, allogrooming was much more extensive and the individual being groomed appeared to facilitate the process by immobility or by changes in posture, there were no recognizable sexual overtones, no solicitations, and no avoidance movements. Gregarious behaviors of some other silvanid beetles are reviewed.

N2  - Published claims in 1887-1903 that the mole cricket Neocurtilla hexadactyla (Perty) occurs in Puerto Rico all seem to be derived from a misidentification made by Agustin Stahl, a medical practitioner and collector of natural history objects, published in 1882. That species does not seem now to occur in Puerto Rico and almost certainly never did. However, the opportunity still exists for it to colonize by wind-assisted flight from islands to the southeast just as we believe did the mole cricket Scapteriscus didactylus (Latreille) as an immigrant. Stahl evidently mistook the latter for the former. According to some subsequent authors, he also stated that it (the mole cricket now believed to be S. didactylus) arrived in the port of Mayaguez in a cargo of guano about 1850 from Peru and thus colonized Puerto Rico. We found no verification for that story, and we doubt it. The first detection of the presence of S. didactylus in Puerto Rico may have been by a French expedition in 1797, but this species may have been present much earlier. Two other species of Scapteriscus were later detected in Puerto Rico. One, S. abbreviatus Scudder, was detected in 1917 and likely arrived as a contaminant of ship ballast some time earlier, perhaps at the port of Mayaguez. The other, S. imitatus Nickle and Castner, was detected about 1940 and seems to have been introduced inadvertently, as a result of mistaken identity. In broad terms, S. didactylus, S. abbreviatus, and S. imitatus are adventive species (meaning they arrived from somewhere else and are not native) in Puerto Rico. The vernacular name changa in Puerto Rico is owned by S. didactylus, which is called West Indian mole cricket in the English-speaking Caribbean. Historical accounts suggest that populations of S. didactylus and of two pest Phyllophaga spp. (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) surged after 1876/1877 and declined after 1920. This coincidence suggests that the cause may have been the same. The cause of the rise might conceivably have been introduction of the mongoose Herpestes javanicus (E. Geoffroy St. Hilaire) in 1877 (because it may have destroyed vertebrate predators) and the cause of the decline might conceivably have been introduction of the toad Bufo marinus L. in 1920, because it is a predator of Phyllophaga and Scapteriscus.

N2  - The naturalist Edward Newman did not provide an etymology for the mecopteran Merope tuber when he described it in 1838. In 1872 Asa Fitch asserted that the genus was named after Merope one of the Pleiades sisters of Greek mythology; however, he provided no reason for his assumption. We researched several etymological alternatives. We concur with Fitch and conclude that Newman did indeed name the genus Merope after the dullest of the Pleiades sisters.

N2  - Three distinct tibial types are recognized within the Rhyparini (Scarabaeidae, Aphodiinae). Based on this, generic limits for the species of Termitodius Wasmann are reevaluated, with the Old World members being transferred to Termitodiellus Nakane. The resulting new combinations are: Termitodiellus besucheti (Paulian), Termitodiellus hammondi (Krikken and Huijbregts), Termitodiellus interruptus (Krikken and Huijbregts), Termitodiellus luzonensis (Howden), Termitodiellus monticola (Krikken and Huijbregts). New World members of Termitodius are split into two genera: Termitodius Wasmann and Aschnarhyparus Makhan. Aschnarhyparus soesilae Makhan is here relegated to a junior synonym of Termitodius peregrinus Hinton, new synonymy, with the resulting new combination being Aschnarhyparus peregrinus (Hinton). A full description of Aschnarhyparus is presented, and Termitodiellus and Termitodius are diagnosed.

N2  - A revision of the generic classification of the tribe Macrodactylini is provided using morphological characters of adults. The revision is based on a taxonomic analysis of 80 genera historically placed in the tribe and a cladistic analysis of 32 genera conforming to the new tribal definition. Synapomorphies for the newly defined Macrodactylini include: the length of the fifth ventrite longer than the fourth ventrite when viewed ventrally, fifth ventrite lacking a complete suture between the tergite and sternite, and the metathoracic tibial spurs (if present) offset, allowing the metatarsus to move past them. Thirty-two genera constitute the newly defined Macrodactylini: Agaocnemis Moser, Alvarinus Blanchard, Ancistrosoma Curtis, Anomonyx Saylor, Anoplosiagum Blanchard, Astaenosiagum Martinez, Barybas Blanchard, Calodactylus Blanchard, Ceraspis Le Peletier and Serville, Ceratolontha Arrow, Chariodactylus Moser, Chariodema Blanchard, Chremastodus Solier, Clavipalpus Laporte, Ctenotis Burmeister, Dasyus Le Peletier and Serville, Dicrania Le Peletier and Serville, Gama Blanchard, Gastrohoplus Moser, Hercitis Burmeister, Hieritis Burmeister, Isonychus Mannerheim, Issacaris Fairmaire, Macrodactylus Dejean, Manodactylus Moser, Manopus Laporte, Oedichira Burmeister, Pectinosoma Arrow, Plectris Le Peletier and Serville, Pristerophora Harold, Rhinaspis Perty, and Schizochelus Blanchard. Sixteen genera are removed or their removal is confirmed from the historical Macrodactylini: Coenonycha Horn, Dichelonyx Harris, and Gymnopyge Linell (to Dichelonychini), Homalochilus Blanchard, Homoliogenys Gutierrez, Liogenys Guerin-Meneville, and Pacuvia Curtis (to Diplotaxini), Diphycerus Deyrolle and Fairmaire (to Diphycerini), Hyperius Deyrolle and Fairmaire (to Melolonthini), Apterodemidea Gutierrez (to Sericoidini), Blepharotoma Blanchard (to Liparetrini ), Diaphylla Erichson (removed from Macrodactylini, and currently unplaced into existing melolonthine tribes), Hilarianus Blanchard, Manonychus Moser, Pseudoisonychus Frey (removed from Macrodactylini, and currently unplaced into existing melolonthine tribes) and Zabacana Saylor (to Epectinaspis (Rutelinae)). Nine new generic synonyms are proposed: Corminus Burmeister, junior synonym of Alvarinus Blanchard; Ctilocephala Burmeister, Eubarybas Gutierrez, and Pseudohercitis Moser, each a junior synonym of Barybas Blanchard; Byrasba Harold, Rhinaspoides Moser, and Ulomenes Blanchard, each a junior synonym of Rhinaspis Perty; Demodema Blanchard, a junior synonym of Plectris Le Peletier and Serville; and Pachylotoma Blanchard, junior synonym of Gama Blanchard. Eight previously proposed synonyms are confirmed: Amphicrania Burmeister, junior synonym of Clavipalpus Laporte; Chlaeobia Blanchard a junior synonym of Phyllophaga Harris; Dioplia Burmeister, junior synonym of Calodactylus Blanchard; Faula Blanchard junior synonym of Ceraspis Le Peletier and Serville; Dejeania Blanchard, preoccupied name and junior synonym of Dichelomorpha Burmeister; Harpodactyla Burmeister, junior synonym of Gama Blanchard; and Microcrania Burmeister, junior synonym of Barybas Blanchard. The removal of Philochloenia (junior synonym of Dichelonyx) is noted. Fifteen genera remain incertae sedis due to lack of adequate study material or insufficient information on their possible removal from Macrodactylini: Acanthosternum Philippi (junior synonym of Modialis, Smith and Evans 2005), Anomalochilus Blanchard, Astaenoplia Martinez, Aulanota Moser, Canestera Saylor, Dichelomorpha Burmeister, Diphydactylus Thomson, Hadrocerus Guerin-Meneville, Hamatoplectris Frey, Mallotarsus Blanchard, Metaceraspis Frey, Paulosawaya Martinez and D&#039;Andretta, Pseudodicrania Gutierrez, Pseudoleuretra Martinez and D&#039;Andretta and Xenoceraspis Arrow. A diagnosis for the thirtytwo genera comprising the Macrodactylini is presented and key characters are illustrated. A key to the genera and hypothesized phylogeny of Macrodactylini is provided.

Their relative abundance and phenology there are given. Taxonomic comments and comparisons with published information are made. Bungalotis lactos Evans, 1952, new status, is considered a species separate from Bungalotis borax Evans, 1952. New genera Nicephellus and Euriphellus are proposed for Eudamus nicephorus Hewitson, 1876, and Papilio euribates Stoll, 1782, respectively, removing both from Dyscophellus and creating new combinations. Discophellus porsena Bell, 1934, reinstated status, is raised from synonymy to a full species of Dyscophellus. The subspecies of Dyscophellus ramusis (Stoll, 1781), as presently recognized, are probably good species; Dyscophellus ramon Evans, 1952, new status, is considered a full species. Pseudonascus, new genus, is proposed for Papilio paulliniae Sepp, [1842], removing this species from Nascus and creating a new combination. Two new species, Bungalotis aureus from Ecuador and Dyscophellus mielkei from Rondonia, Brazil, are described.

N2  - We provide the first species checklist of Mecoptera indigenous to Florida, based upon preliminary data gathered primarily from specimens housed in the Florida State Collection of Arthropods. There are 11 described and one undescribed species of mecopterans, representing three families, inhabiting the state of Florida. These include the recently discovered meropeid (earwigfly), Merope tuber Newman, four species of bittacids (hangingflies), represented by the genus Bittacus Latreille, and 7 species (one undescribed) of panorpids (scorpionflies), represented by the genus Panorpa Linnaeus. We are not certain if one of these, Bittacus texanus Banks, is indigenous, represents a nonindigenous occurrence, or is simply erroneous. Two of the species on our list, Bittacus stigmaterus Say and Panorpa venosa Westwood, represent first state records and one species, Panorpa floridana Byers, is endemic. Six of the species which have been recorded in Florida, M. tuber, Bittacus punctiger Westwood, Panorpa rufa Gray, Panorpa pachymera Byers, Panorpa lugubris Swederus and P. venosa, represent them southernmost records for these species in the continental United States. Perceived diversity and abundance of mecopteran species in Florida are limited by climate, biogeography, and collection bias.

Four species currently listed in Araneus Clerck 1757 (Araneidae) are re-affirmed as synonyms [Araneus lineaacutus (Urquhart 1887) = Zealaranea crassa (Walckenaer 1842), Araneus powelli (Urquhart 1894) = Novaranea laevigata (Urquhart 1891), Araneus sublutius (Urquhart 1892b) = Zealaranea trinotata (Urquhart 1890), Araneus ventricosellus (Roewer 1942) = Eriophora heroine (L. Koch 1871)]. An old record of Araneus brisbanae (L. Koch 1867b) (Araneidae) from New Zealand is a misidentification of Eriophora decorosa Urquhart 1894. The family Philodromidae, the genera Dictyna Sundevall 1833 (Dictynidae) and Linyphia Latreille 1804 (Linyphiidae), as well as Tharpyna munda L. Koch 1875 (Thomisidae) and Araneus brisbanae (Araneidae) are absent from New Zealand.

N2  - The pyrgine genus Porphyrogenes Watson, 1893 (Hesperiidae) is discussed, especially as it occurs in central Rondonia, Brazil. Of eleven species of Porphyrogenes found in Rondonia, four (P. specularis, P. convexus, P. sparus, and P. spadix) are described as new species. Biological details of the genus are discussed. An additional five new species of Porphyrogenes (P. spina, P. sporta, P. splendidus, P. simulator, and P. speciosus) are described from elsewhere. Porphyrogenes cervinus (Plotz, 1883), new synonym of Porphyrogenes ferruginea (Plotz, 1883), reinstated status, is raised from a subspecies of Porphyrogenes despecta (Butler, 1870) to species-level. Porphyrogenes omphale (Butler, 1871), reinstated status, is not synonymous with Porphyrogenes passalus (Herrich-Schaffer, 1869) and becomes a species-level taxon for which no subspecies are recognized; P. passalus was described from a female with no known male. Porphyrogenes sula Williams and Bell, 1940, reinstated status, is raised from synonymy with Porphyrogenes zohra (Moschler, 1879) to species-level. Porphyrogenes stresa Evans, 1952, new status, is raised from a subspecies of P. zohra to species-level. Porphyrogenes immaculata (Skinner, 1920), new synonymy, was described from a male, which we believe is the male of Porphyrogenes sororcula (Mabille and Boullet, 1912). Porphyrogenes suva Evans, 1952, new synonymy, formerly considered a full species, was described from a male which we believe is the male of, and thus synonymous with, Porphyrogenes probus (Moschler, 1877). Porphyrogenes virgatus (Mabille, 1888) and Porphyrogenes eudemus (Mabille, 1888), considered synonyms of P. zohra and Porphyrogenes vulpecula (Plotz, 1882), respectively, without justification by Evans (1952), are removed from those synonymies and retained, along with P. passalus, as females without confirmed affinities. Lectotypes are here designated for Phareas ferruginea Plotz, 1883; Augiades despecta Butler, 1870; Telegonus omphale Butler, 1871; Eudamus pausias Hewitson, 1867; Telegonus probus Moschler, 1877; Telemiades vulpecula Plotz, 1882; Eudamus passalus Herrich-Schaffer, 1869; Thymele virgatus Mabille, 1888; and Thymele eudemus Mabille, 1888. A neotype is designated for Phareas cervinus Plotz, 1883, that being the lectotype of Phareas ferruginea. Types of all taxa in the genus are illustrated. Three named and five unnamed phenotypes of females, not reconciled with males, are identified and described. Twenty-six species are now recognized, making this one of the largest hesperiid genera in the neotropics.

N2  - The Oryctini (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae) is a large tribe of worldwide distribution with approximately 26 genera and 230 species. Fourteen genera and 113 species are found in the Neotropical region. Knowledge of the tribe in the Neotropics is fragmentary, necessitating further studies that address taxonomy, biology, and geographical distribution patterns. This study surveyed the Oryctini of the Brazilian Amazon. The composition of the group in the study area consisted of 7 genera, 18 species and 2 subspecies found in 7 states, 91 municipal districts, and approximately 167 specific localities. States with larger number of species are Amazonas and Para, with 17 and 13 species respectively. Heterogomphus eteocles Burmeister, Heterogomphus aidoneus (Perty), Heterogomphus telamon Burmeister, Megaceras crassum Prell, and Megaceras laevipenne Prell are reported for the first time from the study area. Megaceras laevipenne is reported for the first time from Brazil. The taxonomy, descriptions, distribution maps, and biological and ecological data are provided for all species. A character analysis is provided as well as an identification key for all oryctine species that occur in the Brazilian Amazon.

N2  - The origins of the Cuban bee fauna are reviewed. This fauna began to form 40 million years ago during the Proto Antilles period, through ancestors that arrived in successive invasions from adjacent continental areas. The composition of the Antillean fauna has evolved continuously over millions of years until the present time. The native bee fauna of Cuba is represented by 89 species, contained in 29 genera and 4 families. The number of genera represented per family is as follows: Colletidae (3), Halictidae (8), Megachilidae (4), and Apidae (14). The Cuban apifauna contains four principal groups with distinct biogeographic histories: endemic species of Cuba (43.8%); endemic species of the Antilles shared among multiple islands (33.1%); continental species whose distribution includes the Antilles (16.8%); and species introduced through human activity (6.3%). An analysis of the distributions of Cuban bee species reveals that areas of highest species endemism coincide with the main mountainous nuclei of the East, Center and West. These were: the Sierra Maestra mountain range (with 25 species), Nipe-Sagua-Baracoa (15), the Mountain range of Guaniguanico (14) and the Massif of Guamuaya (14). The distribution of the bees in the Cuban Archipelago was not uniform, possibly due to the ecological conditions of the respective habitats, the diversity and presence of specific food plants, and interspecific competition. The endemism of bees in Greater Antilles is considered high keeping in mind the mobility of the group, as observed not only in Cuba (43.8%) but also Jamaica (50%), Hispaniola (45.6%), and in Puerto Rico and adjacent islands (26.5%).

N2  - We document the presence of Larra bicolor Fabricius (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) in 46 of Florida&#039;s 67 counties. The species is represented by two stocks. The first (released in 1981) originated in Pará, Brazil, but was obtained from Puerto Rico, and became established in Broward County in southern Florida. The second (released in 1988) originated in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, and became established in Alachua County in northern Florida. The Bolivian stock, aided by additional satellite releases from Alachua County, is now widely distributed. The species probably occupies all counties in central and northern Florida, but may yet be absent from some southern counties. Introduction was made for classical biological control of invasive mole crickets.

N2  - The beetle fauna of the island of Barbados is summarized. It is now known to contain 202 genera, and 254 species (in 40 families), of which 232 are named at the species level. Undoubtedly, the actual numbers of species on Barbados are much higher than now known. Nine species are possibly endemic to the island, 15 have been intentionally introduced, and 51 have probably been accidentally introduced through human activity. The remaining 157 named species may occur naturally as a result of natural over-water dispersal processes. These species mostly have a wide distribution in the Antilles and Latin America. The total named fauna is thus about 72% naturally occurring, and 28% the result of human-aided dispersal.

Twelve new species and three previously described species are included in the revision. Keys to New World genera, species of the genus Aegidinus, and distribution maps are provided. Phylogenetic analyses of the world genera of the Orphninae were conducted using 30 adult, morphological characters from representatives of 13 of the 14 genera and three out-group taxa. The subfamily Orphninae is a strongly supported monophyletic group (bootstrap support 88-90%) with respect to the chosen out-group. Characters that support the Orphninae are: mandibles not sickle shaped, molar surface on the mandibles present, lacinia present, and stridulatory comb present. Separate Old and New World lineages are also supported by the phylogeny, when two genera, Goniorphnus Arrow and Stenosternus Karsch, are excluded from the analysis. The new species described are: Aegidinus cornutus Colby, A. crypticus Colby, A. howdenorum Colby, A. howeae Colby, A. oreibates Colby, A. petrovi Colby, A. simulatus Colby, A. sunidgea Colby, A. teamscaraborum Colby, A. tricornis Colby, A. unicus Colby, and A. venezuelensis Colby.

N2  - Recent extensive and intensive field work by the team of M. A. Ivie on the Lesser Antillean island of Montserrat suggests that a mean of 827 beetle species may be expected on that island. This datum makes possible the generation of hypotheses of the probable beetle species diversity on other islands of the Lesser Antilles as a function of the areas of the islands. Figures are given for the presently known, estimated total, and estimated number of unknown species for each principal island. This predicts that many hundreds (if not thou- sands) of beetle species remain to be discovered. This is of importance to land management and conservation interests on these rapidly changing and ecologically fragile islands.

N2  - The pleasing fungus beetle fauna (Coleoptera: Erotylidae: Erotylinae) of the West Indies is reviewed. Keys to adults of all genera and species, descriptions, illustrations, and distribution maps are presented. Representative larvae for most genera are also diagnosed and illustrated. Four new genera are described: Altisessor (type species Altisessor ater, new species), Antillengis (type species Oocyanus brunnipes Kuhnt 1910), Cubyrus (type species Ischyrus sapphirus Skelley 1998b), and Notaepytus (type species Ischyrus flavitarsis Lacordaire 1842). Within Dacne Latreille 1796, a new subgenus is created: Ameridacne (type species Dacne brodzinskyi Skelley 1997a). Seventeen new species are described: Altisessor ater, Altisessor centralis, Altisessor hottensis, Altisessor oriens, Altisessor viridis, Antillengis epochthidius, Notaepytus baorucoensis, Notaepytus cubanacan, Notaepytus cyanoros, Notaepytus cyclosignatus, Notaepytus decoregens, Notaepytus elateroides, Notaepytus elongatus, Notaepytus ignotensis, Notaepytus inversus, Notaepytus lavegaensis, and Notaepytus neibaensis. Most species previously placed in Epytus Dejean 1836 (= Oocyanus Hope 1841) are transferred to Notaepytus resulting in the following five new combinations: Notaepytus flavitarsis (Lacordaire 1842), Notaepytus fulvitarsis (Lacordaire 1842), Notaepytus haitensis (Curran 1944), Notaepytus modestus (Olivier 1807), and Notaepytus tarsalis (Lacordaire 1842). The species Oocyanus gundlachi Zayas 1988 is transferred to Altisessor, resulting in Altisessor gundlachi (Zayas) new combination. These changes restrict Epytus to a single species, Epytus cyaneus (Duponchel 1825). Three species previously synonymized under other taxa are reinstated as valid species: Oocyanus tarsatus Lacordaire 1842 new status, Brachysphaenus (Oogaster) suturalis Lacordaire 1842 new status, and Oocyanus brunnipes Kuhnt 1910 new status. They are transferred into different genera resulting in three new combinations: Notaepytus tarsatus (Lacordaire), Iphiclus (Neoogaster) suturalis (Lacordaire), and Antillengis brunnipes (Kuhnt). Three additional new combinations presented are Cubyrus sapphirus (Skelley), Dacne (Ameridacne) brodzinskyi (Skelley) and Dacne (Ameridacne) ducke (Skelley). To stabilize nomenclature, lectotypes are designated for the following six species: Brachysphaenus suturalis Lacordaire 1842, Erotylus modestus Olivier 1807, Ischyrus flavitarsis Lacordaire 1842, Ischyrus tarsalis Lacordaire 1842, Galleruca guadeloupensis Fabricius 1792, and Oocyanus tarsatus Lacordaire 1842. Additionally, the lectotype of Galleruca guadeloupensis Fabricius is here designated as the neotype of E. marginatus Olivier 1792, thus fixing the identity of both names by creating an objective synonym.

N2  - A taxonomic overview for the fritillary genus Speyeria Scudder (= Argynnis Fabricius) and its placement within the Heliconiinae (Nymphalidae) is presented. Taxonomic accounts, type images, and relevant literature for the 25 subspecies within the Speyeria atlantis (Edwards) and Speyeria hesperis (Edwards) complexes and the 16 nominate Speyeria species are included. Errors in nomenclature are identified, taxonomic, life history, and distributional information are updated, and type locality information is discussed. Images of primary type specimens for all 16 Speyeria species and the 25 subspecies in the atlantis - hesperis complexes appear together in color here for the first time. One new combination of a species-subspecies is created: Speyeria hesperis hanseni Emmel, Emmel, and Matoon, 1998, new combination, which was previously Speyeria atlantis hanseni Emmel, Emmel, and Matoon.

(Cyclanthaceae) is reported as a new plant family and genus host for two species of Spaethiella Barber and Bridwell. Calathea G. Mey (Marantaceae) is reported as the first host record for Aslamidium capense (Herbst) and Calathea lutea Schult. and Calathea majestica (Linden) H. Kenn. are reported as the first host records for Aslamidium semicirculare (Olivier). Immature stages of Demotispa elaeicola (Aslam) are reported for the first time; larvae are external folivores and both larvae and pupae are solitary and lack exuvio-fecal shields. The adults and larvae of D. elaeicola feed by rasping palm fruits, a rare feeding pattern in Cassidinae.

N2  - An annotated list is presented for 81 species of lady beetles (Coccinellidae: Coleoptera) that occur in the state of Iowa, U.S.A., based on literature searches and a review of over 3500 specimens in institutional and private collections. The list includes new state records for Scymnus tenebrosus Mulsant, Diomus debilis (LeConte), Hyperaspis lateralis Mulsant, Hyperaspis deludens Gordon, Epilachna borealis (F.), and Subcoccinella vigintiquatuorpunctata (L.), as well as county records for the non-native species, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas). Collection records are discussed for Nephaspis oculatus (Blatchley), Hyperaspidius militaris (LeConte), Coccinella californica Mannerheim, and S. vigintiquatuorpunctata, which have Iowa records that are disjunct from their larger geographic distributions in North America. I also discuss collection records and the need for additional collecting of coccinellids in Iowa, especially Adalia bipunctata (Schneider), Coccinella transversoguttata richardsoni Brown, and Coccinella novemnotata Herbst, which were once common and widespread but have declined drastically over much of North America, including Iowa.

N2  - Two species of Xyloryctes occur in the United States: X. jamaicensis (Drury) and X. thestalus Bates. Identification and distribution of these species has long been confused but is reviewed and clarified here. Xyloryctes jamaicensis occurs only in the eastern half of the U.S. and not in the southwestern U.S. as previously thought, while X. thestalus occurs in Guatemala and southern Mexico northwards to the southwestern United States. This hypothesis is corroborated by biogeographical and host plant data. Three new synonyms are listed for X. thestalus: X. faunus Casey 1915, X. hebes Casey 1915, and X. thestalus borealis Endrödi. The decline of Fraxinus spp., the food plant of Xyloryctes species, as a result of damage caused by the introduced emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire; Buprestidae) in the United States might portend a similar decline for Xyloryctes species in North America.

N2  - The published beetle fauna of the island of St. Lucia is summarized. It contains 135 genera, and 175 species in 25 families. Four species are accidentally introduced by human activities. Twenty three species are endemic (restricted) to the island. Twenty seven species on St. Lucia are shared only with other islands of the Lesser Antilles, and 22 species are widespread Antilles endemics. The remaining 56.6% of the fauna is otherwise mostly one which is widely distributed in the Antilles and the Neotropics. This suggests that it is mostly an immigrant fauna originating in the continental Neotropics. Undoubtedly, the actual numbers of species on St. Lucia are many times higher than now reported and may originally have been as high as around 1400 species. Of the St. Lucia species known to occur on other islands, the largest numbers are shared with Guadeloupe (102), St. Vincent (79), and Martinique (55).

N2  - Adults, and in some species larvae, of several members of Belonuchus Nordmann (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Staphylininae) and a few related genera seem to be to various degrees consistently associated with flower bracts of the genus Heliconia (Zingiberales: Heliconiaceae). They are predators and eat various dipterous and lepidopterous larvae in that habitat. Adults of at least Belonuchus cephalotes (Sharp) and Odontolinus fasciatus Sharp are able to immerse completely in water to capture larvae and/or pupae of mosquitoes (Culicidae). Adults and larvae of Belonuchus satyrus Erichson, and adults of B. cacao Blackwelder and B. rufipennis (F.) were found in water-filled flower bracts of Heliconia bihai (L.) L. in northern, lowland Venezuela. The bracts also contained mosquito larvae and semiaquatic coleopterous (Chrysomelidae: Hispinae), lepidopterous (Crambidae: Pyraustinae) and dipterous (Syrphidae, Stratiomyidae, Psychodidae, Richardiidae) larvae, and Annelida. In feeding trials, B. satyrus adults and larvae did not feed on hispine larvae or annelids, but did feed on all the lepidopterous and dipterous larvae available to them; adults dragged larvae and pupae of the mosquito genus Toxorhynchites Theobald from shallow water and thus seemed to be the top predators of the food pyramid within bracts. Records are compiled of association of Belonuchus and relatives with Heliconia bracts in the neotropics. We correct the names used for Heliconia spp. by earlier entomological authors working in Venezuela. Their &#039;Heliconia caribaea Lamarck&#039; is H. bihai (L.) L. and their &#039;H. aurea Rodríguez&#039; is H. bihai cv. Aurea.

During surveys for insect floral visitors in the Skukuza Ranger District of Kruger National Park, South Africa, we encountered adults of Aphelochroa sanguinalis on flowers of two tree species, Acacia grandicornuta Gerstner and Acacia tortilis (Forsskal) Hayne (Fabaceae). These two tree species flower in the early rainy season (November-December) and have small white flowers in small round ball-shaped clusters. Adults of Aphelochroa sanguinalis were not found on flowers of 14 other tree species with different floral structures which were flowering at the same time as Acacia grandicornuta and Acacia tortilis. Predatory, reproductive, and defensive behaviors (including the presence of a chemical defense) are described for Aphelochroa sanguinalis based on field and laboratory observations.

N2  - Hiltonius carpinus carpinus Chamberlin, 1943 (Spirobolida: Spirobolidae), is authoritatively recorded from the United States for the first time; it is known only from southern/southeastern Arizona but should be expected in adjoining counties of New Mexico. The northernmost locality is the Pinaleno Mountains, Graham County, and its distribution extends to southern Mexico; the other subspecies, H. c. vulcan (Chamberlin, 1953), occurs in Guatemala. The range of H. c. carpinus includes the type locality of the enigmatic H. fossulifer (Pocock, 1908), lending credence to prior suggestions that the names are synonymous. Three new Mexican states - Durango, Jalisco, and Nuevo León - are documented for H. c. carpinus.

N2  - Specimens of Megacopta cribraria (Fabricius) were collected in northern Georgia in late October 2009, where they were invading homes in large numbers. This is the first known occurrence of this species and the family Plataspidae in the New World. Megacopta cribraria was previously known from Asia and Australia. A key is provided to separate Plataspidae from other families of Pentatomoidea in America North of Mexico. A diagnosis and figures are provided to facilitate recognition of M. cribraria. Reported host plants and other aspects of the biology of this species are reviewed. Megacopta cribraria is considered a pest of numerous legumes in Asia, has the potential to provide biological control of kudzu, Pueraria montana var. lobata (Willd.) Ohwi, (Fabaceae) and likely will continue to be a household pest in the vicinity of kudzu fields as well as become a pest of North American legume crops.

N2  - Localities are documented for the milliped Abacion texense (Loomis, 1837) (Callipodida: Abacionidae) whose distribution forms both the northern and southern ordinal limits in the Western Hemisphere. The westernmost component of Abacion Rafinesque, 1820, A. texense is the only milliped species whose range spans the Mississippi and Pecos rivers and the Rio Grande. Distribution extremes are in Hennepin County (Co.), Minnesota, in the north; Terrell and Potter cos., Texas, in the west; Alcorn Co., Mississippi, in the east; and southwestern Tamaulipas, Mexico, in the south. Occurrences are projected for southeastern South Dakota, northwestern Alabama, and the southwestern periphery of Tennessee. The type series of A. texense consists solely of the male holotype, so a neotype will be needed if this individual is ever lost, because no paratypes were officially designated.

Keys presented help to identify supraspecific and species taxa, all of which are illustrated and diagnosed. Lectotypes are designated for Phanaeus ignecinctus Felsche and Phanaeus ohausi Felsche. Coprophanaeus corythus (Harold), formerly regarded as a subspecies of C. telamon (Erichson), assumes species status. Coprophanaeus magnoi Arnaud, described as a subspecies of C. milon (Blanchard), is raised to species status.

N2  - A comprehensive revision of the Subfamily Parandrinae (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae) from the Hawaiian, Australasian, Oriental, and Japanese regions is presented. Seven (7) new genera are described: Komiyandra, Melanesiandra, Papuandra, Storeyandra, Hawaiiandra, Caledonandra, and Malukandra. All known, indigenous species from these regions are assigned to new genera resulting in the following new combinations: Komiyandra janus (Bates, 1875), K. shibatai (Hayashi, 1963), K. formosana (Miwa and Mitono, 1939), K. lanyuana (Hayashi, 1981), Melanesiandra striatifrons (Fairmaire, 1879), M. solomonensis (Arigony, 1983), Caledonandra austrocaledonica (Montrouzier, 1861), C. passandroides (Thomson, 1867), Hawaiiandra puncticeps (Sharp, 1878), Malukandra heterostyla (Lameere, 1902), Storeyandra frenchi (Blackburn, 1895), and Papuandra araucariae (Gressitt, 1959). Thirty-one (31) new species are described: Komiyandra javana, K. nayani, K. ohbayashii, K. luzonica, K. philippinensis, K. mindanao, K. mehli, K. vivesi, K. lombokia, K. sulawesiana, K. irianjayana, K. menieri, K. sangihe, K. mindoro, K. niisatoi, K. drumonti, K. cabigasi, K. koni, K. johkii, K. poggii, K. uenoi, Melanesiandra bougainvillensis, M. birai, Papuandra gressitti, P. weigeli, P. queenslandensis, P. norfolkensis, P. rothschildi, P. oberthueri, Malukandra jayawijayana and M. hornabrooki. A lectotype is designated for Parandra janus Bates, 1875. Komiyandra janus (Bates, 1875) is excluded from nearly all previously reported locations, even one location given in the original description, and is now only known from Sulawesi. A paralectotype of Parandra janus Bates, 1875, is designated as a paratype for Komiyandra menieri, new species. Komiyandra formosana is excluded from the Japanese (Ryukyu Is.) fauna. Parandra vitiensis Nonfried, 1894, is again placed in synonymy with P. striatifrons Fairmaire (now Melanesiandra striatifrons). A neotype is designated for Parandra austrocaledonica Montrouzier, 1861. A lectotype is designated for Parandra janus Bates, 1875. The lectotype of Parandra gabonica Thomson, 1858, designated by Quentin and Villiers (1975) is considered invalid. Papuandra araucariae (Gressitt, 1959) is excluded from the fauna of Norfolk Island. The African species Stenandra kolbei (Lameere, 1903) is reported for the first time from Asia (N. Vietnam). Keys are presented to separate worldwide genera of Parandrini and all species within the study regions. Illustrations are provided for all species including many special characters to differentiate genera and species.

N2  - Orthosiphon stamineus Bentham, a medicinal plant in the family Lamiaceae, is used to make a well known herbal tea in many countries including Malaysia. Since its establishment as an important cash crop, the herb has been relatively free from any serious insect problems until recently. In Selangor, Malaysia we observed the herb heavily infested by the lace bug Cochlochila bullita Stal (Heteroptera: Tingidae). This is the first record of its occurrence in Malaysia and also the first record on the host plant, O. stamineus. The lace bug damages the host plant by piercing and sucking young leaves and shoots, resulting in the curling and drying of the leaves and shoots. The infestation pattern and survival of C. bullita on O. stamineus indicates this lace bug has the potential to be a serious pest of this medicinal plant.

Male specimens of Sonoma tolulae (LeConte) were collected from the type locality and this species is redescribed. These species bring the total diversity of the genus to 43 species. The genus is divided into four species groups based on characters of the male genitalia. Sonoma corticina Casey was not included in the genus when it was described, thus it cannot be the type species of the genus. We here designate Sonoma tolulae (LeConte) as the type species of the genus Sonoma. A key is provided that will allow discrimination of all eastern species.

N2  - This paper summarizes the information published on the beetle fauna of the island of St. Vincent (excluding the Grenadine islands). The fauna contains 62 families, with 371 genera, and 536 species. The families with the largest number of species are Staphylinidae (128), Curculionidae (54), Chrysomelidae (47), Scarabaeidae (31), Tenebrionidae (30), and Cerambycidae (29). At least 17 species (3.17%) were probably accidentally introduced to the island by human activities. One hundred four species (19.40%) are endemic (restricted) to the island and likely speciated on the island. One hundred twenty species (22.39%) are shared only with other islands of the Lesser Antilles (Lesser Antillean endemics), and 41 species (7.65%) are more widespread Antilles endemics. The remaining 254 species (47.38%) in the fauna are otherwise mostly widely distributed in the Antilles and the Neotropical Region. The St. Vincent beetle fauna has thus mostly originated elsewhere than on St. Vincent and is largely an immigrant fauna from other islands of the West Indies or the continental Neotropics. Of the St. Vincent species known to occur on other islands, the largest numbers are shared with (north to south) Guadeloupe (206), Dominica (115), Martinique (76), St. Lucia (87) and Grenada (298). Undoubtedly, the real number of species on St. Vincent is higher than now reported and may actually be around 1200 or more species.

N2  - Eight new state records and the three newly described species are the subject of this publication. Whiteflies (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha: Aleyrodidae: Aleyrodinae) were collected from 2003 through 2009 within the Las Vegas area of Clark County, Nevada to determine the occurrence of newly established species and host range and distribution. Prior to 2003 the following ten whiteflies were known to be established in Nevada: Aleuroglandulus subtilis Bondar, Aleuroplatus berbericolus Quaintance and Baker, Aleyrodes spiraeoides Quaintance, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), Dialeurodes citri (Ashmead), Siphoninus phillyreae (Haliday), Tetraleurodes mori (Quaintance), Trialeurodes abutiloneus (Haldeman), Trialeurodes packardi (Morrill), and Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood). Based on collections made after 2003, eleven additional whitefly species were found in Nevada. Of these the following eight were described species from California and other western U.S. states: Aleuroparadoxus arctostaphyli Russell, Aleuroplatus gelatinosus (Cockerell), Aleuropleurocelus ceanothi (Sampson), Aleuropleurocelus nigrans (Bemis), Tetraleurodes quercicola Nakahara, Trialeurodes corollis (Penny), Trialeurodes eriodictyonis Russell, and Trialeurodes glacialis (Bemis). Three new species are described and illustrated: Aleuropleurocelus nevadensis Dooley sp. nov., Tetraleurodes quercophyllae Dooley sp. nov., and Trialeurodes pseudoblongifoliae Dooley sp. nov.

N2  - This paper summarizes the published information on the beetle fauna of the northern Leeward Islands (Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda, Nevis, Saba, St. Barthélemy, St. Eustatius, St. Kitts, St. Martin-St. Maarten, and smaller associated islands, excluding Montserrat). These islands are generally smaller, lower, and drier than the remaining Leeward and Windward islands of the Lesser Antilles island arc. The fauna contains 26 families, with 155 genera, and 218 species. The families with the largest number of recorded species are Staphylinidae (36), Cerambycidae (28), Scarabaeidae (25), Tenebrionidae (23), Curculionidae (18), and Carabidae (15). At least 7 species (3.2% of the fauna) were probably introduced to the island by human activities. Sixteen species (7.3%) are endemic (restricted) to a single paleo-island bank and likely speciated there. Twenty nine species (13.3%) are shared only with other islands of the Lesser Antilles (Lesser Antillean endemics), and 43 species (19.7%) are more widespread Antilles endemics. The remaining 123 species (56.4%) in the fauna are otherwise mostly widely distributed in the Antilles and the Neotropical Region. The local beetle fauna is largely an immigrant fauna and has mostly originated elsewhere than on the islands of the northern Leewards. Summary data on total species endemicity of the entire Lesser Antilles indicate the presence of at least 1278 endemic beetle species, which is a density of about 20.7 species per 100 km2. This is now equivalent to that of the endemic vascular plants of the Caribbean islands. This truly makes the Caribbean islands a biodiversity hotspot for beetles. For the northern Leewards, it is evident that the beetle diversity is markedly understudied, and that the actual number of species is many times higher than now known.

N2  - The biogeographic significance of Diplopoda is substantiated by 50 maps documenting indigenous occurrences of the 16 orders, the three Spirostreptida s. l. suborders Cambalidea, Epinannolenidea, Spirostreptidea and all higher taxa including Diplopoda itself. The class is indigenous to all continents except Antarctica and islands/archipelagos in all temperate and tropical seas and oceans except the Arctic; it ranges from Kodiak Island and the northern Alaskan Panhandle, United States (USA), southern Hudson Bay, Canada, and near or north of the Arctic Circle in Iceland, continental Scandinavia, and Siberia to southern mainland Argentina, the southern tips of Africa and Tasmania, and Campbell Island, subantarctic New Zealand. The vast, global distribution is interrupted by sizeable, poorly- or unsampled areas including the Great Basin, USA; the Atacama Desert region of Chile and neighboring countries; southern South American islands; the central Kalahari and Sahara deserts; the Gobi Desert, Mongolia, and all of north-central and western China; from north of the Caspian Sea, Russia, to central Kazakhstan; and the Outback of central Australia. Five Arabian countries lack both samples and published records of indigenous diplopods Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates as do Turks and Caicos, in the New World, and Mauritania and possibly Egypt, Africa. New records, including the first for Chilognatha from Botswana and the first specific localities from Northern Territory, Australia, are cited in the Appendix. Increased emphasis on mappings in taxonomic research is warranted along with investigations of insular species swarms that constitute a microcosm of the early evolution of the class. The largest species swarm in the Diplopoda is Diplopoda itself! Four taxa Glomerida, Platydesmida, Julida, and Callipodida occur exclusively in former Laurasian Territory, and seven Glomeridesmida, Sphaerotheriida, Siphonophorida, Spirobolida, Epinannolenidea, Spirostreptidea, and Stemmiulida all absent from Europe, are primarily southern/Gondwanan except for secondary dispersals in Mexico/Central America by all but Sphaerotheriida, which are absent from the New World. Siphoniulida and Siphonocryptida, known from only two and four areas, respectively, are declining towards extinction; the former may constitute a relictual intermediate between Colobognatha and Eugnatha. Polyxenida, Polyzoniida, Chordeumatida, and Polydesmida occur on nearly all continents, while Cambalidea, extinct in Europe, inhabit North/Central America and southeast Asia with an isolated area in Iran. Southeast Asia, from southern China to Sumatra, harbors all 16 orders plus Cambalidea and Spirostreptidea. Southern taxa were passively transported to Asia beginning in the Silurian on terranes that rifted from the proto-Australia area of the Gondwana deriving from breakup of the supercontinent Pannotia (hereafter Gondwana I); they drifted northwards and accreted to Siberia+Kazakhstania/Euramerica, and later the proto-Laurasia part of Pangaea, from the Permian to the Jurassic. Laurasian taxa could not penetrate southeastern Asia until those terranes had accreted and the region was available for colonization; before this, they evolved, differentiated, and dispersed east/southeastward from source areas in Euramerica, as evidenced by detached faunal remnants in present-day Central Asia and the Himalayas. Southeastern Asia is thus a mixing area for northern and southern diplopods as is Mexico/Central America, which Gondwanan forms entered in the Late Carboniferous, ~ 306 ma, when Euramerica collided with the proto-South America/Africa region of Gondwana I, thereby forming Western Pangaea. Closure of the Panama Portal in the Pliocene, ~ 5 ma, allowed northward dispersals of South American forms but is too recent to account for occurrences throughout the Central American land bridge and even into the USA, though it probably explains northward spread of Epinannolenidea and the polydesmidan family Paradoxosomatidae to Costa Rica. Occurrence of the latter in Dominica, Lesser Antilles, is regarded as indigenous rather than introduced and probably represents occurrence in the Proto-Antillean area before it rifted from northern South America in the Cretaceous/ Paleocene, ~ 66 ma. As the earliest Paleozoic fossil is from Scottish Silurian deposits, an operative hypothesis explaining early diplopod evolution requires origin far enough before then for major dichotomies to have taken place and for ancestral forms to have dispersed and become established relatively simultaneously on both Gondwana I and the northern micro-continents (Baltica, Laurentia, and Siberia). Only one source area meets these requirements, the Avalonia terrane of Gondwana I before it rifted in the early Ordovician (~ 480 ma) and drifted to and combined with Baltica in the mid-Ordovician (~ 450 ma); 10 my later, Baltica+Avalonia merged with Laurentia to form Euramerica. Presence on Avalonia and neighboring parts of Gondwana I prior to rifting mandates at least Mid- to Late Cambrian origin ( Polydesmida > Siphoniulida > Siphonocryptida > Spirostreptida s. l./Cambalidea > Chordeumatida ≥ Polyzoniida > Glomeridesmida ≥ Sphaerotheriida > Epinannolenidea > Stemmiulida ≃ Siphonophorida > Spirobolida > Spirostreptidea > Glomerida ≃ Platydesmida > Callipodida > Julida.

N2  - Five new species of anilline ground beetles (Carabidae: Trechinae: Bembidiini) are described from the Appalachian Mountains and Piedmont Plateau of eastern United States. Two species, Anillinus unicoi n. sp. (from the Unicoi Mountains, North Carolina) and A. carltoni n. sp. (from the Great Smoky Mountains, North Carolina/ Tennessee), inhabit the crests of adjacent mountain ranges, and share similarities with A. moseleyae Sokolov and Carlton. These three comprise a high-altitude group of species in the region. The third species A. chilhowee n. sp. is one of the smallest representatives of the loweae-group of species. It differs from its relatives in characters of male genitalia and inhabits the isolated Chilhowee Mountain ridge between Ocoee and Hiwassee Rivers (Polk County, Tennessee). The fourth and fifth species possess complex arrays of spines on the internal sac of the aedeagus, similar to A. valentinei (Jeannel) from caves of Alabama. In the case of A. smokiensis n. sp. (Gregory Cave, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee), the aedeagal similarity suggests a close relationship with A. valentinei. Anillinus chandleri n. sp. from the Piedmont Plateau (Sumter National Forest, South Carolina) is similar to A. cornelli Sokolov and Carlton, also described from the Carolina Piedmont region. Keys are provided for the new species, where possible.

N2  - Curculionoidea (Coleoptera) of the West Indian island of Dominica are composed of 111 genera and 214 species and subspecies. Some of the species listed are morphospecies, or are known to be undescribed, but all are identified at least to genus. Previously the fauna was recorded as 31 species. Numbers presented herein represent a seven-fold increase in species diversity. Furthermore, the widespread nature of many species demonstrates that the supposedly endemic faunas of many West Indian islands may be based on collecting biases or a lack of people capable of providing species level identifications.

N2  - This paper summarizes the published information on the beetle fauna of the island of Martinique, in the Lesser Antilles. The fauna is known to contain 42 families, with 201 genera, and 270 species. The families with the largest numbers of species are Cerambycidae (57), Curculionidae (43), Scarabaeidae (42), Tenebrionidae (18), and Staphylinidae (17). At least 15species (5.5%) were probably accidentally introduced to the island by human activities. Forty six species (17.0%) are endemic (restricted) to the island and likely speciated on the island. Sixty seven species (24.8%) are shared only with other islands of the Lesser Antilles (Lesser Antillean endemics), and 26 species (9.6%) are more widespread Antilles endemics. The remaining 116 species (42.8%) in the fauna are otherwise mostly widely distributed in the Antilles and the Neotropical Region. The Martinique beetle fauna has mostly originated elsewhere than on Martinique and is largely an immigrant fauna from other islands of the West Indies or the continental Neotropics. The numbers of Martinique species shared with other larger islands of the Lesser Antilles are (north to south) Montserrat (73), Guadeloupe (175), Dominica (98), St. Lucia (68), St. Vincent (93), and Grenada (88). Undoubtedly, the real number of species on Martinique is much higher than now reported and may actually be around 1600 or more species.

N2  - Three new species of the caddisfly genus Goera Stephens (Trichoptera: Goeridae) are described from the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Goera neboissi sp. n., G. jolanda sp. n., and G. higleri sp. n. were found to be related to G. skiasma Neboiss, which is the only previously recorded species from Sulawesi. These species share the following combination of characters: an upright IXth segment; the absence of the median dorsal process of tergum X; a long, mesal process of the inferior appendage with a subbasal projection; and, the absence of parameres.

N2  - The taxonomy of the African and Madagascan species of the tiger beetle genus Chaetodera Jeannel 1946 (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) is reviewed based on studies of primary types and additional museum specimens. Six species are recognized: C. andriana (Alluaud 1900), C. antatsima (Alluaud 1902), C. blanchardi (Fairmaire 1882), C. maheva (Künckel d’Herculais 1887), C. perrieri (Fairmaire 1897), and C. regalis (Dejean 1831). All species are illustrated, including color variants, and a key to species and maps of species distributions are provided. A hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships is proposed for the nine worldwide species of the genus Chaetodera based on computerized parsimony analysis of a matrix containing data on 16 adult morphological characteristics.

N2  - The taxonomically neglected milliped order Glomeridesmida and family Glomeridesmidae (infraclass Pentazonia, superorder Limacomorpha) inhabit 21, rather than seven, regions of the world, being newly recorded from Thailand; Cambodia; the Republics of Palau, the Philippines, and Vanuatu; New Britain, Bismarck Archipelago; the Island of New Guinea (both West Papua [formerly Irian Jaya], Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea); and Sulawesi and Borneo, Indonesia. Occurrence in Fiji is confirmed with two additional samples, and discovery is predicted in southern China, Myanmar, and perhaps Madagascar. Coupled with published localities, these records suggest subcontinuous (super)ordinal and familial ranges extending some 12,480 km (7,800 mi) southeastward from northwestern Thailand to Fiji. Though infrequently encountered, the taxa may actually be diverse and abundant within this area, which encompasses all of the Indochina and Malay peninsulas, the Philippines, Palau, the Island of Borneo and Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon and Santa Cruz Islands, Vanuatu, and Fiji; it excludes Taiwan, Australia, New Caledonia, and the Loyalty Islands. The paucity of preserved individuals probably results from their dark pigmentations and minute sizes, adults being <6.5 mm long; Berlese extractions and sieved litter techniques are recommended over hand collecting. Glomeridesmida are much more continuous, widespread, and abundant in the "east" than previously believed and clearly do not comprise a minor, insignificant taxon. The first glomeridesmidan photos are published.

Es una de las pocas reservas en México creada para la protección de la selva tropical caducifolia (seca) y sistemas asociados. Cinco especies de ciempiés han sido registradas previamente para la Reserva: Cormocephalus impressus Porat, 1876; Dendrothereua linceci (Wood, 1867); Ectonocryptoides quadrimeropus Shelley y Mercurio, 2005; Scolopendra polymorpha (Wood, 1861) y Scolopendra viridis Say, 1821. A partir de julio de 2010 se inició con el primer estudio formal de la fauna de ciempiés en la Reserva. Después de un año de muestreos, ocho morfoespecies de ciempiés se han determinado para la Reserva: Cryptops (Haplocryptops) cf. acapulcensis Verhoeff, 1934; Cryptops sp.; Rhysida immarginata (Porat, 1876); Scolopendra morsitans Linnaeus, 1758; Polycricus sp.; Sogona sp.; Orphnaeus sp.; y Straberax sp. Esta es la primera vez que Cryptops (Haplocryptops) cf. acapulcensis es encontrada en otra localidad distinta de su localidad tipo. Estudios previos han determinado el papel de los ciempiés como parte de la dieta de mamíferos y componente de la fauna del suelo. The Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve is located on the Pacific coast of the state of Jalisco in Mexico. The Reserve was founded in 1993 and covers 13142 hectares. It is one of the few reserves in Mexico created for the protection of the tropical deciduous (dry) forest and associated ecosystems. Five centipede species have hitherto been reported from the Reserve: Cormocephalus impressus Porat, 1876; Dendrothereua linceci (Wood, 1867); Ectonocryptoides quadrimeropus Shelley and Mercurio, 2005; Scolopendra polymorpha (Wood, 1861) and Scolopendra viridis Say, 1821. The first formal study on the centipede fauna in the Reserve commenced in July 2010. After one year of sampling, eight morphospecies were found in the Reserve, namely Cryptops (Haplocryptops) cf. acapulcensis Verhoeff, 1934; Cryptops sp.; Rhysida immarginata (Porat, 1876); Scolopendra morsitans Linnaeus, 1758; Polycricus sp.; Sogona sp.; Orphnaeus sp.; and Straberax sp. This is the first time Cryptops (Haplocryptops) cf. acapulcensis has been collected at a location other than its type locality. Previous studies have determined the role of the centipedes as part of mammals´s diets and as component of the soil fauna.

This is the first known mainland species of this previously Antillean genus. Sclerotized rods in the apical segment of the ovipositor of Chalcosicya Blake and related genera are shown to be useful systematic characters within the eumolpine tribe Adoxini. Relationships with other genera suggest that Chalcosicya belongs to a clade derived from ancestors with a western Tethyian distribution.

Bielas esclerotizadas en el segmento apical del ovipositor en Chalcosicya y en géneros relacionados se ven como characteres filogeneticos útiles dentro del tribo Adoxini. Relaciones con otros géneros sugieren que Chalcosicya pertence a un clado derivado de ancestros con una distribución del Tethys oeste.

N2  - The diplopod orders Callipodida and Polydesmida, and their respective families Abacionidae and Xystodesmidae, are initially recorded from South Dakota as is Polydesmidae from North Dakota. Other new records of indigenous taxa include Abacion Rafinesque, 1820/A. texense (Loomis, 1937) and Pleuroloma/P. flavipes, both by Rafinesque, 1820, from South Dakota, and Pseudopolydesmus Attems, 1898/P. serratus (Say, 1821) from Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Carolina, and the District of Columbia. New records of Aniulus garius Chamberlin, 1912, A.

L. Koch, 1847), are newly recorded from the Dakotas. The distribution of P. serratus, which extends from Maine to South Carolina and the Florida panhandle, west to Texas, and north to Fargo, North Dakota is described and discussed. This distribution exhibits a prominent southeastern lacuna which we hypothesize suggests replacement by younger, more successful species, as postulated for a similar distributional gap in Scytonotus granulatus (Say, 1821).

N2  - Based on two “uni-ocellate” females, the world’s first introductions of the milliped order Stemmiulida are recorded from Florida, United States (US). One individual was collected in 1976 in Gainesville, Alachua County (Co.)., in northcentral peninsular Florida, and the other was taken in 1991 some 408 km (255 mi) to the south-southeast in Pompano Beach, Broward Co. The absence of further individuals and additional samples suggests that the introductions did not result in viable populations, and stemmiulidans are not presently established in the state; the Gainesville site was reinvestigated in 2012 without finding additional specimens. New records from Mexico include the first from Chiapas, Oaxaca, Tabasco, Yucatan, San Luis Potosí, and Tamaulipas states, with the northernmost ordinal locality now becoming Rancho del Cielo, northwest of Gómez Farias, in the last. A northward range expansion of about 460 km (288 mi) from the previous limit, Xalapa, Veracruz, the site lies a mere 40 km (25 mi) south of the Tropic of Cancer and only some 320 km (200 mi) south of the Rio Grande and the US border at McAllen, Hidalgo Co., Texas. Indigenous Stemmiulida are not expected in the forested Rio Grande Valley of southernmost Texas, but their occurrence in the adjoining Mexican state renders such a discovery more plausible than before.

N2  - Surveys for adult Cylindera (s. str.) lunalonga (Schaupp) (Coleoptera: Carabidae: Cicindelinae) were conducted between 2001 and 2011 at over 80 sites throughout the species’ historic range in the San Joaquin Valley and Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Previously considered extirpated from the Valley, these surveys resulted in finding adults at 18 sites, several with large populations (>50 individuals). As suggested by historic records, our studies confirmed that the Valley populations of Cy. lunalonga occur in what were historically wetland sites, but are now lowland agricultural croplands. Adults were always associated with wet, muddy soil within and along the edges of irrigation ditches. A comparison of morphology, behavior, habitat, and conservation is made with the only known extant Sierra Nevada population.

N2  - Larvae of thirty one species of antlions (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae) belonging to eleven genera live in the protection of cave mouths or large rock overhangs in Australia. New taxa proposed here include the following three new genera: Australeon, Newleon, Speleon. The following twelve new species are described: Froggattisca kakadu; Froggattisca rennerensis; Newleon fragilis; Speleon cavernicolus; Speleon pilliga; Speleon yallingup; Stenoleon xanthopsis; Xantholeon cavernicolus; Xantholeon kakadu; Xantholeon newi; Xantholeon pallens; Xantholeon pentlandensis. Two cave species are transferred into a new genus becoming new combinations: Australeon illustris (Gerstaecker), Australeon manselli (New and Matsura). The small non-cave species previously placed in Stenoleon Tillyard are transferred to Bandidus Navás, becoming B. gradostriatus (New), B. copleyensis (New), B. grandithecus (New), and B. navasi (New), new combinations. All known species of six genera (Stenoleon Tillyard, Xantholeon Tillyard, Eophanes Banks and three new genera) are known only in cave mouths. Also, species of Heoclisis Navás, Froggattisca Esben Petersen, Glenoleon Banks, Heoclisis Navás and Myrmeleon Linnaeus contain species living in cave mouths. Two main types of caves are found in Australia; those with loose organic material and those with loose inorganic material. The cave habitat is divided into four zones and several subzones. Many species are restricted to one zone or another but species of Stenoleon may overlap zones. Discussions of the species and some of their biological requirements are provided. One new parasite record is given, an undetermined species of Echthrobacella Girault (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) reared from the larvae of Speleon yallingup Miller and Stange. Diagnoses or descriptions are given for all of these cave species including distributional data. Keys to the cave mouth inhabiting antlions of Australia (adults and larvae) are provided including a revised key to the Xantholeon Tillyard. Se documentan treinta uno especies en once géneros de Myrmeleontidae que viven en las entradas de cuevas en Australia y representan mas especies que en cualquier otra parte del mundo. Se describen tres genéros nuevos, Australeon, Newleon, y Speleon y doce especies nuevas: Froggattisca kakadu; Froggattisca rennerensis; Newleon fragilis; Speleon cavernicolus; Speleon pilliga; Speleon yallingup; Stenoleon xanthopsis; Xantholeon cavernicolus; Xantholeon kakadu; Xantholeon newi; Xantholeon pallens y Xantholeon pentlandensis. Dos especies son transferidas en un nueva género resultando en dos combinaciones nuevas: Australeon illustris (Gerstaecker) y Australeon manselli (New and Matsura). Tambien, cuatro especies en el género Stenoleon Tillyard son transferidas al género Bandidus Navas, resultando en cuatro combinaciones nuevas: B. gradostriatus (New), B. copleyensis (New), B. grandithecus (New) y B. navasi (New). Hay dos tipos de cuevas en Australia, unas con detritus orgánicos y otras con detritus principalmente inorgánicas. En algunas cuevas existen cuatro principales zonas de habitación. Todas las especies de cinco géneros (Eophanes Banks, Stenoleon Tillyard, Xantholeon Banks y tres nuevos géneros) están restringidas a las cuevas.

N2  - Surveys during the summer of 2004 and August 2009 on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, USA resulted in collection of 1064 adult spiders representing 84 species. Barcoding of spiders collected in 2009 resulted in DNA barcode data for 212 specimens representing 63 species. DNA barcode data were then used to facilitate the identification of otherwise unidentifiable juvenile and female specimens as well as to investigate phylogenetically four lineages with large branch lengths between specimens. Using morphological and DNA barcode identifications provided a more complete list of identified specimens than was possible using morphological data alone.

N2  - Coleoptera species composition and succession in downed woody debris habitats are poorly known in eastern North America. A photoeclector emergence chamber was used to concentrate Coleoptera that emerged from various decay classes of fine and coarse woody debris (FWD and CWD, respectively) collected in primary and secondary forest sites in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee, USA. A total of 5673 adult beetle specimens, representing 305 lowest identifiable taxa within 227 genera and 51 families, was collected. One hundred fifteen species (38%) were represented by single individuals. Many more specimens and species were collected from CWD (4129 and 247, respectively) than from FWD (1544 and 162, respectively), but species richness accumulation curves were not significantly different. Many more specimens but an equal number of species were collected from primary forest (3347 and 207, respectively) than from secondary forest (2326 and 207, respectively). Species accumulation curves indicated higher richness in secondary forests. Based on a subset of 71 species represented by 10 or more specimens, 27 species were associated with fresh fine woody debris, 11 species with weathered fine woody debris, four with coarse woody debris decay class I, 14 with coarse woody debris decay class II, and eight with coarse woody debris decay class III–IV. Sixteen species were associated with secondary forests, whereas 28 species were associated with primary forests. Coarse woody debris decay class II taken in primary forests had highest absolute species richness with 156 species. In coarse woody debris species overlap decreased with increased difference in decay indicating faunal succession. Published works related to the study of the ecology of downed woody material are briefly summarized. Recommendations on developing a database of legacy trees for future researchers are given. Notes on the biology and photographs of the 71 species represented by 10 or more specimens are given to provide an atlas of eastern U.S. beetle species most commonly encountered in these habitats.

N2  - The insect fauna within inflorescences of Heliconia bourgaeana Petersen (Zingiberales: Heliconiaceae) was evaluated in Parque Metlac, Fortín de las Flores, Veracruz, Mexico between May and October 1995. Floral bracts were present in May and some persisted to October, despite much destruction in August by a grackle, Quiscalus mexicanus (JF Gmelin) (Icteridae). Flowers were abundant in the bracts in May-June, after which their number declined as fruits matured. Insects that fed on the flowers were most abundant in May-June; several of them could be pollinators; the immature stages of most of these insects were absent from Heliconia Linnaeus. The floral bracts contained water enriched by decomposition of the flowers, and this provided nutrition for aquatic organisms. Syrphid larvae (Diptera) contributed the largest biomass among the aquatic insects, and their distribution among bracts was more uniform in time than that of other aquatic insects. Larvae of Culicidae and Psychodidae (Diptera) were more variable in density and were more abundant after decomposition of the flowers. The most abundant aquatic predators of culicid larvae were larvae of Toxorhynchites Theobald (Culicidae). The most abundant amphibious predators of dipterous larvae were adults of four species of Platydracus Thomson (Staphylinidae), one of them yet undescribed. To capture its prey, the Platydracus adult would immerse its head and thorax, with open mandibles, to snap at passing dipterous larvae. La fauna insectil asociada con las inflorescencias de Heliconia bourgaeana Petersen (Zingiberales: Heliconiaceae) fue evaluada en el Parque Metlac, Fortín de las Flores, Ver., México entre mayo y octubre de 1995. Las brácteas florales estuvieron presentes en mayo y persistieron hasta octubre, aunque con mucha destrucción a partir de agosto debido a la acción del zanate mexicano (Quiscalus mexicanus (JF Gmelin), Icteridae). Las flores en las brácteas fueron abundantes en mayo y junio, después de lo cual su número se redujo conforme aumento el tamaño de los frutos, los cuales maduraron en octubre. Los insectos adultos que se alimentaron en las flores fueron más abundantes en mayo y julio; varios de ellos podrían actuar como polinizadores. Los estados inmaduros de la mayoría de estos insectos no fueron encontrados en Heliconia Linnaeus. Las brácteas florales contuvieron agua enriquecida por la descomposición de las flores, lo cual provey de nutrimentos para algunos de los organismos acuáticos. Las larvas de la familia Syrphidae (Diptera) constituyeron la mayor biomasa de las larvas de insectos y su distribución fue notablemente uniforme entre las brácteas en cada espiga floral y a lo largo del periodo de observación. Las larvas de las familias Culicidae y Psychodidae (Diptera) fueron más variables en su densidad, y más abundantes después de la descomposición de las flores. Los depredadores acuáticos de las larvas de Culicidae más abundantes fueron larvas de Toxorhynchites Theobald (Culicidae). Los depredadores anfibios más abundantes de las larvas de dípteros fueron cuatro especies de Platydracus Thomson (Staphylinidae), una de ellas aun no descrita. Para capturar su presa, un estafilínido sumerge su cabeza y su tórax, con mandíbulas abiertas, en el agua e intenta capturar las larvas de dípteros.

N2  - This report contains the first inclusive phylogenetic analysis and taxonomic structure for the genera presently included within the scarabaeid tribe Dynastini. The study was based upon morphological, biogeographic and molecular data and yielded direct support for the recognition of three subtribes in the Dynastini: Dynastina MacLeay, New Status (Dynastes Kirby, Augosoma Burmeister, Megasoma Kirby, Golofa Hope), Xylotrupina Hope, New Status (Xylotrupes Hope, Allomyrina Arrow, Trypoxylus Minck, Xyloscaptes Prell) and Chalcosomina Rowland and Miller, New Subtribe (Chalcosoma Hope, Haploscapanes Arrow, Beckius Dechambre, Eupatorus Burmeister, Pachyoryctes Arrow). The results provide indirect but significant support for the origin of the tribe Dynastini to be of an age no later than the early Late Cretaceous. Molecular and morphological evidence suggests that Eupatorus as constituted in current taxonomic literature is not monophyletic, and taxonomic alternatives are discussed to address this deficiency. A plausible explanation is also provided for the perplexing use by F. W. Hope of the family-group names Xylotrupidae and Dynastidae.

N2  - The community within extremely decayed downed coarse woody debris, here referred to as decay class V (CWD5), has never been systematically sampled. The presumption has been that rotten wood is eventually overrun by surrounding soil and litter inhabitants. Leaf litter and CWD5 were sampled for Coleoptera with a sifting/ Berlese technique at three primary and three secondary forest sites in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee, USA, during fall 2006 and spring 2007. A total of 4261 adult beetle specimens, representing 216 lowest identifiable taxa within 159 genera and 28 families, were collected. Sixty-six species (31%) were represented by single individuals. Many more specimens (3471) and species (170) were collected from leaf litter than from CWD5 (790 and 111, respectively) but species accumulation curves showed that species richness was not significantly different between the two habitats. Eight species were significantly associated with CWD5, and 40 species were significantly associated with leaf litter. Species richness was significantly higher in secondary forest than primary forest, but more species were significantly associated with primary than secondary forest. Species richness was significantly higher in spring than fall. Notes on the biology and photographs of the 59 species represented by 10 or more specimens are given to provide an atlas of common eastern U.S. beetle species found in these habitats. Overall CWD5 is a distinct but overlooked habitat that may harbor numerous undescribed species or species considered rare.

N2  - Collection methods and/or habitats sampled influence how many and which species are captured during entomological surveys. Here we compare Coleoptera catches among three survey activities, each using a single collection method, at the same study sites in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA. Activities included: short-term flight intercept trapping (FITs); sifting/Berlese funneling of leaf litter and extremely decayed downed coarse woody debris; and using emergence chambers containing coarse woody debris of various decay classes. In total, 2472 adult beetle specimens, representing 217 lowest identifiable taxa within 164 genera and 42 families, were collected during the FIT survey. Each survey activity yielded more than 2000 specimens, and a combined total of 413 species was collected. A combination of all surveys yielded the highest species richness when normalized for number of specimens indicating that variation of habitat and/or collection method significantly increases species richness. Of single surveys the FIT survey had the highest absolute species richness (217) and the highest richness when normalized for number of specimens. Species overlap among survey activities was low (Sorensen’s quotient of similarity was 0.20–0.27), which showed that each was about equally dissimilar from all others. Overlap of catch between FITs and emergence chambers was too low to justify substitution of emergence surveys with the FIT survey protocol used when attempting to collect saproxylic Coleoptera.

N2  - Beetles of the genus Paederus sensu stricto Fabricius, 1775 (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) are often noticed because of their potency in inducing a dermal lesion, so-called linear dermatitis. This genus, which is placed in the tribe Paederini and subfamily Paederinae of Staphylinidae, currently comprises 490 species worldwide. Our study presents a short review of the former records of Paederus spp. in Iran plus some unpublished data. Field collections were done during March-October yearly (1997-2007) in northern and southern Iran and April-June from central, eastern, western and north-western Iran (2008-2009). The present study adds four species to the Iranian fauna of the genus Paederus, which are P. brevipennis Lacordaire, 1835, P. basalis Bernhauer, 1914, P. pubescens Cameron, 1914 and P. schoenherri Czwalina, 1899. Paederus brevipennis and P. schoenherri are the first members of the subgenus Harpopaederus Scheerpeltz, 1957, ever reported from Iran. Considering previous reports, museum-deposited materials and our findings, 14 species and subspecies of the genus Paederus, which are grouped in five subgenera, occur in Iran. These subgenera are Eopaederus Scheerpeltz, Harpopaederus Scheerpeltz, Heteropaederus Scheerpeltz, Paederus Fabricius and Poederomorphus des Cottes; however P. duplex spectabilis Bernhauer, 1913 is not yet attributed to any of the 13 so-far defined subgenera.

N2  - La tribu Oryctini (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) comprende un grupo de escarabajos Dynastinae con distribución mundial, compuesta por 26 géneros y aproximadamente 230 especies, de los cuales 14 géneros y aproximadamente135 especies se encuentran distribuidas en la región Neotropical. Las especies se distribuyen tanto en los bosques tropicales secos como en las selvas pluviales, con un rango altitudinal que va desde el nivel del mar a los 2600 m. Algunas especies se alimentan de materia orgánica o frutos dulces en descomposición, otros barrenan los tallos de las plantas vivas, razón por la cual son considerados plagas de varios cultivos de interés económico. El conocimiento actual de la tribu en el Neotrópico es escaso, siendo necesarios estudios que contribuyan a aclarar aspectos relacionados con la taxonomía, filogenia y patrones de distribución geográfica de la especies. Este trabajo da a conocer la composición, diversidad y distribución de la tribu Oryctini en Colombia. En el país, la diversidad del grupo está representada por 7 géneros y 32 especies, registradas en 29 departamentos y aproximadamente 628 localidades. Se registra por primera vez para Colombia Heterogomphus curvicornis Prell, Megaceras jason (Fabricius) y Podischnus oberthueri Sternberg. Para cada especie se proporcionan descripciones y mapas de distribución. Se presenta una clave en ingles y español para las especies de Orcytini de Colombia y una lista de chequeo de las especies registradas para el país. The Oryctini (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) are dynastine scarab beetles with a worldwide distribution consisting of 26 genera and about 230 species, of which 14 genera and 135 species are distributed in the Neotropical region. The species of this tribe occur in habitats ranging from temperate and tropical dry forests to rain forests and cloud forests from sea level to 2600 m in elevation. Some species feed on organic matter or decaying fruits while others bore into the stems of living plants, in which case they occasionally reach pest status. Knowledge of the tribe in the Neotropics is still fragmentary, necessitating further studies that address taxonomy, phylogeny, and geographical distribution patterns of the species. This study surveyed the Oryctini of Colombia. In Colombia there are 7 genera and 32 species, found in 29 departments, 330 municipal districts and approximately 628 specific localities. Heterogomphus curvicornis Prell, Megaceras jason (Fabricius), and Podischnus oberthueri Sternberg are reported for the first time from Colombia. Taxonomic descriptions and distribution maps are provided for all species. An identification key, in Spanish and English, is provided for all oryctine species that occur in Colombia. A checklist of the oryctine beetles of the Colombia is provided.

N2  - The purpose of this paper is to reassess the taxonomy of Phanaeus MacLeay (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) to accommodate new taxa and changes in taxonomic opinion since the publication of Edmonds’ 1994 revision of the genus. The two subgenera and 13 species groups established by Edmonds (1994) remain unchanged. A revised set of keys with accompanying comments and illustrations separates 54 recognized valid species. Seven recently described valid species are incorporated into the revised classification: Phanaeus blackalleri Delgado-Castillo, 1991; P. bordoni Arnaud, 1996; P. changdiazi Kohlmann and Solís, 2001; P. lecourti Arnaud, 2000; P. martinezorum Arnaud, 2000; P. yecoraensis Edmonds, 2004; and P. zapotecus Edmonds, 2006. The new name Phanaeus sororibispinus Edmonds and Zidek replaces Phanaeus alvarengai Arnaud, 1984, a primary junior homonym of P. alvarengai Pereira and d’Andretta, 1955. Three subspecies recognized in 1994 are elevated to species rank, new status: Phanaeus texensis Edmonds, 1994; P. pilatei Harold, 1863; and P. guatemalensis Harold, 1871. Phanaeus obliquans Bates, 1887 is removed from synonymy and given new status as a valid species. Twelve new junior subjective synonyms (bold) are recognized: P. tridens balthasari Arnaud, 2002 (of P. tridens Castelnau, 1840); P. dzidoi Arnaud, 2000 (of P. palaeno Blanchard, 1843); P. genieri Arnaud, 2002 (of P. amethystinus Harold, 1863); P. prasinus jolyi Arnaud, 2001 (of P. prasinus Harold, 1868); P. kirbyi ledezmai Arnaud, 2002 (of P. kirbyi Vigors, 1825); P. achilles lydiae Arnaud, 2000 (of P. achilles Boheman, 1858); P. chalcomelas grossii Arnaud, 2001 (of P. chalcomelas [Perty, 1830]); P pyrois malyi Arnaud, 2002 (of P. pyrois Bates, 1887); P. tridens moroni Arnaud, 2001 (of P. tridens Castenau, 1840); P. lecourti peruanus Arnaud, 2000 (of P. lecourti Arnaud, 2000); P. endymion porioni Arnaud, 2001 (of P. endymion Harold, 1863); P. pseudofurcosus Balthasar, 1939 (of P. tridens Castelnau, 1840); and P. prasinus trinidadensis Arnaud, 2001 (of P. prasinus Harold, 1868). “Phanaeus viridicollis” Olsoufieff, 1924 (sensu Arnaud 2002) is an unavailable name here considered a color variant of P. pyrois Bates, 1887.

N2  - We review the variegated mud-loving beetle fauna of the southeastern United States (Coleoptera: Heteroceridae), with an emphasis on Mississippi and Alabama. A key is presented to all species known to occur in the southeastern US, and includes several extra-limital species. Descriptions, illustrations and distribution maps are presented for each species. One new species, Tropicus nigrellus, is described and a lectotype is designated for Heterocerus schwarzi Horn. Our molecular data suggest that many previously recognized generic concepts are unnatural. As a result, the following generic synonymies are proposed: Culmus Pacheco 1964, Damfius Pacheco 1964, Efflagitatus Pacheco 1964, Erus Pacheco 1964, Filiolus Pacheco 1964, Gradus Pacheco 1964, Lanternarius Pacheco 1964, Lapsus Pacheco 1964, Neoheterocerus Pacheco 1964, Olmedous Pacheco 1964 and Peditatus Pacheco 1964 are synonyms of Heterocerus Fabricius; the genera Centariatus Pacheco 1964, Explorator Pacheco 1964, and Microaugyles Pacheco 1964 are synonyms of Augyles Schiödte. New combinations proposed and used in this paper include: Augyles auromicans (Kiesenwetter 1851, Heterocerus), Heterocerus parrotus (Pacheco 1964, Lanternarius), Heterocerus sandersoni (Pacheco 1964, Neoheterocerus) and Heterocerus selanderi (Pacheco 1964, Efflagitatus), Heterocerus texanus (Pacheco 1964, Peditatus). Other new combinations for North American species formed as a result of these generic reconfigurations, but not used in this paper, include: Heterocerus inciertus (Pacheco 1964, Damfius), Heterocerus longilobulus (Pacheco 1964, Neoheterocerus), Heterocerus sinuosus (Pacheco 1964, Lanternarius), Augyles canadensis (Fall 1920, Heterocerus), Augyles compactus (Fall 1937, Heterocerus), Augyles moleculus (Fall 1920, Heterocerus) and Augyles mundulus (Fall 1920, Heterocerus). New combinations for South American species suggested by molecular data, all originally described in the genus Efflagitatus, include: Heterocerus boliviensis (Pacheco 1964), Heterocerus freudei (Pacheco 1973), Heterocerus furmidus (Pacheco 1964), Heterocerus ingeniosus (Pacheco 1964), Heterocerus meridianus (Pacheco 1975), Heterocerus reticulatus (Pacheco 1964), Heterocerus solitarius (Pacheco 1973), Heterocerus splendidus (Pacheco 1964), Heterocerus tortuosus (Pacheco 1973), Heterocerus woodruffi (Pacheco 1975). No new combinations involving synonymy within the genera Culmus, Erus, Filiolus, Gradus, Lapsus, and Olmedous were proposed because all included species were originally described as Heterocerus.

However, based on museum insect specimens, the introduction of H. axyridis in Colombia occurred in 1989 or earlier, making it the second oldest record of the species in South America after the deliberate releases of the species in Argentina in 1986. Currently in Colombia, H. axyridis is well established and is here recorded from the States of Antioquia, Caldas, Cauca, Cundinamarca, Nariño, Tolima and Valle del Cauca.

N2  - Retournement or turning of the aedeagus about its longitudinal axis through about 180o during development is known in Chrysomeloidea (Coleoptera). This change in the orientation of the organ may be observed during the postembryonic development. This change produces certain morphological effects. By observing these morphological features in the imago the retournement may be inferred. Such morphological features in Curculionidae (Coleoptera) are here recorded. From this it has been inferred not only that retournement of the aedeagus is included in the ontogeny of curculionids, but also that the change of orientation of the organ occurs by the same mechanism as in Chrysomeloidea. These inferences attest the notion of a close phyletic relationship between the superfamilies Curculionoidea and Chrysomeloidea.

N2  - We describe the rediscovery of the Florida scorpionfly, Panorpa floridana Byers (Mecoptera: Panorpidae), at Gold Head Branch State Park, Clay County, Florida, based upon a single, living, adult specimen photographed on 4 November 2010. The hardcopy photographic prints and electronic digital images of this panorpid are the first vouchers for P. floridana in 28 years, the only observation of a living specimen, and the sixth individual known of this seemingly rare Florida endemic.

N2  - Coastal species are under considerable threat from recreational activities and climate change. The tiger beetle Cicindela hirticollis Say (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) was recorded historically from 30 locations along the shores of New York City and Long Island, New York. We conducted surveys for extant populations of this species at 40 sites from 1989 to 2010. Adults of C. hirticollis were found at 13 beaches. Only four sites had 40 or more adults of C. hirticollis active at the time the beach was surveyed. No beetles were detected on the large coastal beaches that were formerly occupied by this species. Many coastal beaches of New York receive heavy human foot and vehicle traffic and are therefore unlikely to provide suitable habitat for C. hirticollis without a shift in beach management that recognizes the potential of some beaches as wilderness systems capable of supporting the full array of beach-dependent species.

N2  - Seventy-nine Cerambycidae and two Vesperidae species not previously recorded from Bolivia are listed along with the department where they were collected, and are thus added to the known fauna. An additional 22 species from existing publications, but whose Bolivian distribution is not recorded in the 2013 version of Bezark and Monné (2013), are listed separately to assist inclusion in this important reference. These records, along with the 60 new species described (through February, 2013) since Wappes et al. (2011), brings the total number of Cerambycidae and, closely related families Disteniidae, Oxypeltidae and Vesperidae, to 1,717 species known from Bolivia. New departmental records for another 254 species are listed. Color illustrations for 80 of the 81 species newly recorded from Bolivia are provided. Among the new records for Bolivia is Lathroeus oreoderoides Thomson, 1864 previously known only from South America without exact locality, hence this is its first recorded distribution. A male of Myzomorphus Dejean, 1835 collected at the same time and locality as a female Myzomorphus amabilis (Tippmann, 1960) is likely the previously unknown male of the species. Both sexes are illustrated.

N2  - The Neotropical members of the genus Aesalus Fabricius (Coleoptera: Lucanidae: Aesalinae) are transferred to a new genus, Trogellus, due to their morphological dissimilarity and molecular divergence from the Old World species of Aesalus, and the new genus is revised. A neotype is designated for A. trogoides Albers and a lectotype for A. neotropicalis Bates. Aesalus smithi Bates is placed into synonymy with Aesalus trogoides, new synonymy. Two new combinations result from the transfer of species formerly in Aesalus: Trogellus trogoides from Mexico and Trogellus neotropicalis from Guatemala. In addition to the two known species, eight new species are described: T. catrachitus, T. chapinitus, T. hawksi, T. herrmanni, T. maesi, T. narizotus, T. ticiticus, and T. trifinius. This brings the total number of species of Central American aesalines to ten. A phylogeny of Aesalini based on two gene regions of ribosomal DNA is presented. Due to clear morphological differences and large molecular divergence between species groups, two additional new subgenera of Trogellus are proposed: Mayaesalus and Trogoides.

Sipha maydis was discovered in California in 2007 and now has been found in Georgia. The genus also includes two native species: Sipha agropyronensis (Gillette) and Sipha flava (Forbes). Sipha maydis can be distinguished easily from all the other species in the genus that occur in North America because it is black. All the species except S. agropyronensis have been implicated in damage to crop plants. A key to the apterae and alatae of Sipha found in North America is included.

N2  - Cupido comyntas (Godart), the eastern tailed-blue, is a legume-feeding caterpillar native to North America. One of its three subspecies, Cupido comyntas comyntas (Godart), is distributed over the eastern half of the United States and southeastern Canada. This subspecies was recorded for the first time feeding on cultivated soybean. Caterpillars fed upon soybean at various developmental stages, ranging from seedlings to podded plants, in several fields within a 5-km radius in Brookings County, South Dakota, from July 1 – 25, 2013. Feeding was confined to leaves, and no pod damage was observed. The caterpillars occurred at relatively low densities that were unlikely to have affected yield of soybean crops. An early maturity soybean line, H007Y12, had a lower incidence of C. comyntas comyntas caterpillars than a relatively later maturity line, H19Y11. Butterflies of C. comyntas comyntas were observed feeding from soybean flowers on multiple dates in July and early August. As the geographic distribution of C. comyntas comyntas considerably overlaps the area where soybean is grown, entomologists should watch for and document any additional infestation of soybean by these caterpillars.

Based on records of arrival in various parts of the West Indies and the species’ inability to fly, this suggestion seems reasonable. Scapteriscus imitatus apparently was released in Puerto Rico as a result of mistaken identification (introduction – arriving with assistance from humans – although inadvertent), and has not expanded its range in the West Indies. Although the principal mode of dispersal for the other two species also has been suggested to be ship ballast, we present an alternative based on flight which would seem at least equally as plausible. We suggest that S. didactylus could have dispersed by flight from South America through the Lesser Antilles; likewise N. hexadactyla probably from the Yucatan Peninsula to Cuba, and from South America northward through the Lesser Antilles, in at least some localities assisted by wind. Our zoogeographical alternative, if correct, means that the natural range expansions of these latter two species began very long ago and without human assistance – they were not introduced recently to the West Indies.

N2  - Chromosomes of four rare and localized Caribbean Prioninae (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) species were analysed. All have 26, XY karyotypes. Those of Solenoptera canaliculata (Solenopterini) from Guadeloupe nearby islands Les Saintes and Marie-Galante and S. quadrilineata from Martinique look similar. They have a single pair of sub-metacentric autosomes. The karyotype of S. touroulti from St. Lucia has three sub-metacentric pairs. It appears closer to that of Hovorodon maxillosum (Mallodontini) from Marie-Galante which has ten sub-metacentric pairs. The CO1 gene sequence, taking two European species Aegosoma scabricorne (Prioninae: Aegosomatini) and Ergates faber (Prioninae: Ergatini) as external groups was analysed in S. canaliculata and S. quadrilineata. In spite of their karyotype similarity, their CO1 genes differ by a strong accumulation of mutations. Thus, either chromosomal or genetic data confirm the species status of the three closely related Solenoptera species. Ten different CO1 haplotypes are found among the 21 specimens of S. canaliculata studied from les Saintes and Marie-Galante. Both different haplotypes were found in each island and identical haplotypes were found in different islands. Hence, the gene flow was not interrupted. Biogeographical parameters favor the hypothesis that repeated passages between islands were made possible by floating trunks, principally from Les Saintes to Marie-Galante.

N2  - Tynommatidae, n. stat., elevated from Tynommatinae, is established as a schizopetalidean family encompassing the western North American callipodidans previously assigned to the Mediterranean Schizopetalidae. It is considered a valid taxon despite somewhat anatomically dissimilar subfamilies, and Colactidinae, Texophoninae, Diactidinae, and Aspidiophoninae constitute tribal elevations and additional new statuses. With a subbasal telopodal prefemoral process, Diactis hedini, n. sp., requires rediagnoses of all three diactidine genera, Diactis Loomis, 1937, and Florea and Caliactis, both by Shelley, 1996, and suggests that telopodal branches ‘B’ in congeners and Florea represent distal relocations of the process along the stem. Similarities in the sizes and shapes of the pleurotergal carinae suggest a sister-group relationship with the other, and partly sympatric, New World family, Abacionidae, which is supported by gonopodal similarities between Colactidinae and Abacion Rafi nesque, 1820. The Western Interior Seaway of the Cretaceous Period, Mesozoic Era, ~141–66 million years ago, appears to have fueled divergence by isolating “proto-abacionid stock” in “Appalachia,” the Eastern North American land mass, which has subsequently spread well into previously inundated areas. The allopatric position of Texophoninae, on the Gulf Coast of south Texas around 1,136 km (710 mi) east of the most proximate familial records, is attributed to this waterway, which eradicated faunal linkages with “proto-Tynommatidae” in “Laramidia,” the Western North American land mass. Texophoninae probably survived the Cretaceous on insular refugia; however, it is rarely encountered anymore and seems destined for imminent extinction. Representatives of the east-Asian families, Caspiopetalidae, Paracortinidae, and Sinocallipodidae, also possess demarcated pleurotergal crests and, implausible though it seems, may share ancestry with the North American taxa vis-à-vis the “Asiamerica” and or “Boreotropic” concepts.

N2  - Sundapyrochroa, a new genus of pyrochroine Pyrochroidae, is described from three Sunda Shelf species most recently assigned to Pseudopyrochroa Pic: Sundapyrochroa atricolor (Pic), comb. nov., recorded from Peninsular Malaysia, Sundapyrochroa nigripennis (Pic), comb. nov., recorded from Peninsular Malaysia, and Sundapyrochroa sumatrensis (Pic), comb. nov., recorded from Borneo (Malaysia: Sabah) and Sumatra (Indonesia). Schizotus rotundicollis Pic, syn. nov., is proposed as a junior synonym of S. sumatrensis. No evidence could be found to support subspecifi c categories for S. nigripennis, thus, Pseudopyrochroa nigripennis notaticeps Pic, syn. nov., is proposed as a junior synonym of S. nigripennis. Gross anatomy of the cranium (female, male), antennae (female, male), and genitalia (male) are both diagnostic and enigmatic, suggesting no clear relationships with other pyrochroine genera.

N2  - Pinnaspis chamaecyparidis Takagi, Pinnaspis hikosana Takagi and Pinnaspis uniloba (Kuwana), occurring on Chamaecyparis obtusa Endl., Styrax japonica S. et Z. and Cleyera japonica Thunb. are newly documented in the Korean fauna of armored scales (Diaspididae). The characters of these species are here redescribed with illustrative photographs and information on distribution and hosts along with a dichotomous key to the species of Pinnaspis for correct species identification. In addition, the paper discusses the current status of Pinnaspis buxi (Bouché) and Pinnaspis strachani (Cooley) which are known as native armored scale insects of Korea by analyzing information on the result of the survey.

N2  - The Guadeloupe Archipelago, the French overseas Département de Guadeloupe, is a geographically associated group of islands and a natural biogeographic unit. The islands have been available for terrestrial colonization since the late Tertiary. From the viewpoint of beetle systematics and biodiversity, this is the most important set of islands of the Lesser Antilles because more species have been described or recorded from Guadeloupe than any other island or group in the Lesser Antilles. We present a summary of the 1338 beetle species recorded in the literature from the archipelago, in 60 families, and 719 genera. The families with the largest numbers of species are Curculionidae (420), Staphylinidae (153), Chrysomelidae (75), Cerambycidae (69), Scarabaeidae (64), and Tenebrionidae (59). Four hundred eighty two species are known only from one or more islands of the Guadeloupe group and likely speciated there. Guadeloupe is the type locality for an additional 59 species. At least 61 species have been accidentally introduced by human activities. A total of 261 species are known only from the Lesser Antilles including Guadeloupe. The remaining species are naturally more widespread in the Lesser Antilles, or the West Indies, and elsewhere in the New World. The actual number of species on the Guadeloupe Archipelago is estimated to be around 1850 or more species

N2  - The Virgin Islands (except St. Croix) are geologically part of the Puerto Rico Bank and biologically related to Puerto Rico, but their cockroaches (Dictyoptera: Blattaria) were not yet as well studied as those on Puerto Rico. To elucidate the number of species, life history, range distribution, and seasonal abundance of these cockroaches, we have conducted a quantitative study since June 2000 using a Malaise trap on Guana Island, British Virgin Islands, in addition to other conventional collecting methods. We found 21 species: Blattella germanica (Linnaeus), Cariblatta antiguensis (Saussure and Zehntner), Cariblatta sp. 2, Cariblatta sp. 3, Colapteroblatta sp. 1, Eurycotis improcera Rehn, Eurycotis sp. 2, Euthlastoblatta facies (Walker), Hemiblabera brunneri (Saussure), Nyctibora lutzi Rehn and Hebard, Panchlora sagax Rehn and Hebard, Periplaneta americana (Linnaeus), P. australasiae (Fabricius), Plectoptera infulata Rehn and Hebard, P. rhabdota Rehn and Hebard, Plectoptera sp. 3, Pycnoscelus surinamensis (Linnaeus), Symploce pararufi collis Roth, S. rufi collis (Fabricius), polyphagid sp. 1 (Compsodes sp. 1), and polyphagid sp. 2. Among them, nine are new records for the Virgin Islands and fi ve for Guana Island. In addition, Euthlastoblatta diaphana (Fabricius), Nyctibora noctivaga Rehn, Panchlora nivea (Linnaeus), P. viridis (Fabricius), and Rhyparobia maderae (Fabricius) were recorded historically but were not rediscovered. As a result, the number of species is increased from 17 to 26 for the Virgin Islands, and from 10 to 15 for Guana Island. Overall, only fi ve species are edifi carian and likely introduced. Nymphs of polyphagid sp. 2 and Euthlastoblatta facies are reported for the fi rst time as dwellers in termite runways. Only eight species came to the Malaise trap; their phenology illustrates close but not necessarily synchronic relationship with both the timing and amount of rainfall. Monthly abundance showed spring and fall highs and summer and winter lows. Yearly abundance reached lows when annual rainfall decreased below a threshold average of 2.0 mm per day. Seasonality and response to drought varied among species. This paper lays a foundation for further research on diversity of cockroaches from the Virgin Islands and their relationships with those from Puerto Rico.

N2  - The endemic Floridian milliped genus, Floridobolus Causey, 1957, more closely related to tylobolinines in the western United States (US), Mexico, and Guatemala than syntopic spirobolines, is incorporated into Spirobolidae (Spirobolida: Spirobolidea). With taxonomic priority by one year, its monotypic family is reduced to Floridobolinae, n. stat., comprising Floridobolini and Tylobolini, n. stats., the counterpart to Spirobolinae, comprising Spirobolini and Aztecolini, n. tribe; relationships are Floridobolini + (Tylobolini + (Aztecolini + Spirobolini)). Like F. penneri Causey, 1957, 208 km (130 mi) to the south in the Lake Wales Ridge, Polk and Highlands counties (cos.), F. orini n. sp., inhabits “Big Scrub” environments in the Ocala National Forest, Marion Co. Biogeographic reconstructions, compatible with broader hypotheses on the class’ evolutionary history, indicate that, from a presumptive source area in northern Mexico where the subfamilies overlap, spirobolid stock penetrated the “proto-US” four times, once per tribe, before the Western Interior Seaway developed in the Cretaceous Period, Mesozoic Era. Three expansions headed northeastward into future “Appalachia,” from which taxa spread southward as the Seaway receded. Floridobolini, the fi rst invader, had to be in “proto-Georgia” and positioned to penetrate Florida when the sand dunes that comprise the “Central Highlands” emerged from the sea in the Oligocene (Cenozoic), ~25 mya. As sea levels rose and fell, the dunes fragmented into islands and the subcontinuous Floridobolus population was partitioned. The southernmost became F. penneri; F. orini inhabited a northern island; and a graduate student is investigating other insular remnants for additional species. Shortly after Floridobolini began spreading, Hiltonius/ Tylobolini arose and expanded both southward to Guatemala and northwestward to California; Tylobolus Cook, 1904, diverged in the latter area and dispersed northward to Washington and eastward to Utah/Arizona. The third invader, and the second to disperse northeastward, was Aztecolini, which probably eradicated Floridobolini from some of its established range and was partitioned into Mexican (Aztecolus Chamberlin, 1943) and US (Chicobolus Chamberlin, 1947) taxa by the Seaway. The fi nal invader, Spirobolini, dispersed northwestward and northeastward to both the Pacifi c and Atlantic coasts; instead of Trans-Beringia, we prefer penetration of the Asian part of “Asiamerica,” when it temporarily formed during the Cretaceous, to explain the Mongolian fossil genus, Gobiulus Dzik, 1975, herein assigned to Tylobolini, and the occurrence of Spirobolus Brandt, 1833, in China and Taiwan today. In the east, Narceus Rafi nesque, 1820, spread across Appalachia, eradicated most remaining populations of Floridobolus and Chicobolus, and expanded to Maine and Québec after retreat of the Wisconsin glaciation. Chicobolus and Narceus also penetrated earliest Florida; the former established itself in the Central Highlands, spread through the widening peninsula as sea levels fell, and remained on insular refugia when waters rose. Apparently fueled by the different Floridian environments, Narceus underwent time-consuming speciation; consequently, Floridobolus and Chicobolus still survive on the peninsula, and an allopatric population of the latter inhabits coastal South Carolina. However, N. gordanus (Chamberlin, 1943) occurs syntopically with both in peninsular Florida and may be actively eradicating them from their last stronghold. Trigoniulus niger, takahasii, and segmentatus, all by Takakuwa, 1940, are removed from Spirobolidae and returned toTrigoniulidae (Trigoniulidea). New records in the Appendix include the fi rst of Aztecolus from Durango and Jalisco, Mexico.

N2  - A gomphid male from west-central Wisconsin (Eau Claire County, North Fork Eau Claire River, 11 June 1994, K. J. Tennessen leg) with characters that are intermediate between Ophiogomphus carolus Needham, 1897 and Ophiogomphus rupinsulensis (Walsh), 1862 is described and illustrated. The specimen appears to be a hybrid based on intermediate character states of 1) color pattern (slightly closer to O. carolus), 2) hamule morphology (shaped slightly more like those of O. carolus), and 3) anal appendage morphology (slightly more like those of O. rupinsulensis).

N2  - Three female callipodidan samples from northern Pakistan are assigned to Bollmania kohalana (Attems, 1936) (Caspiopetalidae), the only ordinal representative documented from the country; a new record of Kaschmiriosoma loebli Jeekel, 2003 (Polydesmida: Paradoxosomatidae), is also provided. Localities are summarized for the 14 Pakistani, 6 Kashmirian, and 5 Bangladeshi diplopods. The last include one unidentifi able female of Zephronia Gray, 1832 (Sphaerotheriida: Zephroniidae), and two adventive species, Trachyjulus calvus (Pocock, 1893) (Spirostreptida: Cambalopsidae) and Asiomorpha coarctata (Saussure, 1860) (Polydesmida: Paradoxosomatidae); all constitute new country records. Two obscurely documented Bangladeshi diplopods are Gonoplectus cautus (Attems, 1936) (Spirostreptida: Harpagophoridae), and Trichopeltis watsoni Pocock, 1895 (Polydesmida: Cryptodesmidae). The Pakistani polydesmidan, Quasidesmus puschtun Golovatch, 1991, is transferred from Pyrgodesmidae to Cryptodesmidae.

N2  - Multiple sources of confusion surround the identity of Ochodaeus grandiceps Fairmaire, 1897, from Sichuan, China (Coleoptera: Ochodaeidae). Herein the type specimen is illustrated to solve these taxonomic issues. Examination of the holotype indicates that the species must be transferred to the genus Nothochodaeus Nikolajev, 2005, resulting in a new combination. The genus Mimochodaeus Nikolajev, 2009, based on a misidentifi cation of O. grandiceps as its purported type species, is discussed. Finally, Cuban specimens had been treated erroneously as belonging to O. grandiceps, and so the species had remained undescribed. A new species, Parochodaeus perdidus, is described to accommodate them.

The gonopods differ from those in the El Dorado Co. population in having shorter/acuminate prefemoral processes and blade-like, rather than spatulate, processes “B” that angle away from the solenomere instead of overhanging it. Additionally, a strong distomedial prefemoral lobe, absent from the El Dorado population, arises from the stem in Placer Co. males.

N2  - Past concepts and synonymies of Anadenobolus monilicornis (Porat, 1876) (Spirobolida: Rhinocricidae), including the implied synonymy of Rhinocricus ectus Chamberlin, 1920, are consolidated into a formal account with the fi rst illustrations of the holotype. Prior to 1492, A. monilicornis was probably indigenous to an unknown number of southern Antillean islands, but through modern commerce, man has introduced it to Florida, Bermuda, Barbados, the Cayman Islands, and Jamaica, and probably repeatedly (re)introduced conspecifi c material to all the Lesser Antilles, resulting in subcontinuous gene pool mixing and reticulate evolution. A broad species concept is necessary to encompass the multitudinous variants, some of which have been recognized as species; only one true Caribbean species of Anadenobolus Silvestri, 1897, may exist, for which arboreus (Saussure, 1859) is the oldest name. The distribution of A. monilicornis presently extends from Bermuda and southern coastal Florida through the Greater and Lesser Antilles (excepting Cuba) to eastern coastal Venezuela and central Suriname, with outlier populations in Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and Tampa Bay and the eastern Floridian panhandle; excepting Barbados, the indigenous range may have extended from Hispaniola through the same area. Introductions into Manitoba, Canada, and North Carolina, USA, have not yielded viable populations. Localities are newly recorded from St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands.
