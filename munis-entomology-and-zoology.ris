N2  - This study was carried out on Ahır Mountain (Kahraman Maraş, Turkey), in the  Mediterranean Region between April and October of 2004 and 2005. In this region, there is  not any work about ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) so far. A total of 24 ground  beetles species were recorded in the pitfall traps. Among them, Calathus (Calathus)  libanensis pluriseriatus Putzeys, 1873 and Calathus (Calathus) syriacus Chaudoir, 1863  were the most abundant species. Separately, habitat selection (grassland, forest edge and  forest interior) of all species, diversity, monthly distribution and chorotypes, ecology of these  species are given in this study. It was recorded that the diversity of ground beetles was  significantly higher in the forest edge and grassland than in the forest interior. There was no  significant difference in the diversity of ground beetles of the grassland and the forest edge in  Ahır Mountain.

N2  - The biology of weevil species, Larinus onopordi (F.) living on globe thistle  Echinops sphaerocephalus L. was described for the first time. The species is univoltine,  adults overwinter under hiding object as aggregated. Eggs are inserted into the flowerhead;  L. onopordi deposited eggs superficially, 1-23 (3.76) eggs each capitulum may be occur in  one flowerhead, larvae develop in capitulum eating and destroying the seeds. In late  summer, larvae complete their growth; prepare pupal case 1-4 (0.84) case in each  flowerhead and pupation occurs in here. New generation adults emerge from flowerhead  after waiting several days. Thus, this weevil has one generation per year in northeatern  Turkey. A braconid wasp, Bracon facialis Thom. (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) reared from  the pupal stage of L. onopordi.

N2  - Although widespread in European fir forests, Choristoneura murinana  (Hübner) was not known in Asia Minor until 2000. Owing to the serious damage caused by  this budworm in the Lakes District to stands of Abies cilicica Carr., this study was launched  on its distribution, morphology, biology and injury. Forewings of the C. murinana adults are yellowish-beige colored. The mean wingspan  between forewings was 22.8±1.7 mm (mean ± standard deviation) in female and 18.5±1.6  mm (mean±SD) in male adults. The main flying period of C. murinana lasts from the mid of  June to the end of July. The moth is univoltine and overwinters in larval stage. C. murinana  has a total of 6 larval instars, with greyish-light green mature larvae. Pupation takes place  among the last needles they feed on. C. murinana causes serious damage to fresh shoots,  buds and needles, especially when the larvae molt to third stage in the second half of April.  Spring feeding of the larvae causes more damage than summer and autumn feeding.

As a result of the investigation, in all methods  other than leaf disk method during larva instar, depending on the rising rate of  concentration of these extracts prolonged larvae and pupae instar, causing a high death rate  of larvae and pupae during instar, malformed larvae and pupae occured, decreased number  of adults from pupae, and led health females to lay fewer eggs. In disk method antifeed  effect was observed in larvae and adults. In dipping methods in adults, it was determined  that females laid much fewer eggs than the control individuals and that less larvae occured.

Species distributions within Turkey are presented as a catalogue of  provincial records. Seventeen species are here recorded for the first time from the  southwestern Anatolian region. The presence of the three following species in Turkey is  confirmed: Dytiscus semisulcatus MULLER, Eretes griseus (FABRICIUS), Hydaticus  ponticus SHARP. Several species known previously from only a few localities in Turkey  have been shown to have much wider distributions in the country. In accordance with the  present study and literature data 49 species of Dytiscidae and 3 species of Noteridae are  known from the southwestern Anatolian region.

N2  - The taxonomic status of the generic names of European Travuniidae is  studied. Although the generic name Abasola Strand, 1928 is widely used, Travunia  Absolon, 1920 is a valid replacement name for Absolonia Roewer, 1915, junior homonym  of Absolonia Börner, 1901 (Collembola), while Abasola is a superfluous replacement  name for the same. Type species of Travunia is Absolonia troglodytes Roewer, 1915.  Travunia anophthalma Absolon, 1920 is an objective synonym of Absolonia troglodytes  Roewer, 1915. The authorship of Dinaria is Roewer, 1935 (who first provided a formal  proposal of the generic name as such), not Hadi, 1932 (who cited this as a nomen  nudum). Type species of Dinaria is Travunia vjetrenicae Hadi, 1932. Peltonychia  Roewer, 1935 and Kratochviliola Roewer, 1935 are unavailable names, being published  after 1930 without an explicit designation of a type species among the species originally  included. Since it was based on an unavailable name, Peltonychiinae Kratochvíl, 1958 is  also unavailable. The authorship of Peltonychia must be credited to Martens, 1978 (who  first gave a diagnosis and designated a type species), but the available generic name  Hadziana Roewer, 1935, currently under the synonymy of Peltonychia, has priority and  must be used instead of it, with Hadziana postumicola Roewer, 1935 as type species. The  correct name of a superfamily including the Travuniidae and the Triaenonychidae should  be Triaenonychoidea, not Travunioidea. The following new combinations are made:  Abasola sarea Roewer, 1935, is newly combined as Hadziana sarea; Phalangodes  navarica Simon, 1879 (currently Kratochviliola navarica) is newly combined as  Hadziana navarica; Abasola hofferi ?ilhavı, 1937 is newly combined as Travunia  hofferi; Phalangodes claviger Simon, 1879 (currently Peltonychia clavigera) is newly  combined as Hadziana clavigera; Peltonychia gabria Roewer, 1935 is newly combined as  Hadziana gabria; Scotolemon leprieurii Lucas, 1860 (currently Peltonychia leprieurii) is  newly combined as Hadziana leprieurii; Scotolemon piochardi Simon, 1872 (currently  Peltonychia piochardi) is newly combined as Hadziana piochardi and Peltonychia tenuis  Roewer, 1935 is newly combined as Hadziana tenuis.

N2  - The common looper caterpillar, Buzura suppressaria and the red slug  caterpillar, Eterusia magnifica are serious defoliators of tea bushes (Camellia sinensis) of  the Terai and Dooars areas of Darjeeling and N.E. India. While the former species prefers  young leaves, the latter feeds on more mature leaves. This study aims to find the  difference of the nutritional indices for the two folivores, such as relative consumption  rate (RCR), relative growth rate (RGR), gross growth efficiency (ECI), net growth  efficiency (ECD) and approximate digestibility (AD) and relate the same with their  maintenance cost and production index (body mass). B. suppressaria has an edge over  Et. magnifica as far as RCR and AD values are concerned. However, Et. magnifica could  make up for the poor food quality (as they feed on mature tea leaves) by increasing their  feeding period and better food conversion efficiencies. Higher value of AD in B.  suppressaria may be due to higher quantity of the digestive enzymes in the midgut of this  caterpillar. Significant differences in the activities of amylase, protease and lipase could  be detected at salivary and midgut levels in the two folivores. The adaptive strategies in  exploiting the different qualities of leaves, from two hampers of tea bushes is important  for optimal food utilization by the two folivores with niche segregation.

N2  - Studying insect digestive enzyme is important for understanding the function  of their digestive systems. Today, many attentions are focused on plant enzyme inhibitors  and their application in producing transgenic plants. Determining the properties of all  digestive enzyme is the first step that should be observed. Enzyme was active at 25 to 50°C  and its considerable activities were observed at 35 to 50°C. However, the highest level of  activity occurred at 45°C. So, the optimum temperature for the enzyme activity was 45°C.  Optimum pH for enzyme activity was 5. The amylase activity in anterior and posterior lobes  and accessory gland of the salivary glands complex were 0.578, 1.545 and 0.405 U/mg  protein, respectively, and were significantly different at P<0.01. The effects of the mineral  compounds on adults? á-amylase activity were significant (P<0.01). Copper chloride,  ammonium sulfate, sodium nitrate, magnesium chloride, magnesium nitrate (all at  concentrations of 1 and 3 mM) and ammonium phosphate (1 mM) significantly inhibited the  á-amylase activity in E. integriceps.

N2  - The behavioral response of Chilocorus bipustulatus L. to variation in eunymus  scale, Unaspis eunymi Comstock density at different patches was examined under  laboratory conditions (27 ± 2°C, 70 ± 5 % of RH, 16L: 8D). Different densities of eunymus  female scales were set on Eunymus japonicus leaves under a stereomicroscope and were  placed in plastic containers. Plastic containers were arranged randomly equidistant from  one another in the cage. The experimental procedure involved introducing different number  of female predator separately in the center of the cage. The patterns of percentage of time  spent on each patch, revealed a tendency for aggregation on the patches of high prey  densities. Predators spent proportionately more time on high density patches than on low  ones. The proportion of predators found in each patch also indicated aggregation of  predators in high density patches. The values of aggregation index for 1 to 16 female  predators were all greater than zero showing the concentration of the predator in patches  with high prey densities. The percentage of prey eaten was variable in different prey patch  densities, showing a density dependence tendency. It was found in this reseach that  Chilocorus bipustulatus aggregated in high density patches of its prey, but the pattern of  predation, was variable at different patch densities of the prey. Density dependent pattern of  predation has been shown to suppress pest population and even contribute to population  stability.

N2  - The present study was undertaken to recognize the types of hemocytes of P.  demoleus by electron microscopy. Six types were identified: prohemocytes (PR),  plasmatocytes (PL), granulocytes (GR), spherulocytes (SP), adipohemocytes (AD),  oenocytoids (OE), with two additional types, vermicytes (VE) and podocytes (PO), having  debatable identities. The PRs were mostly rounded small cells with characteristically large  and filling nucleus showing an uneven surface due to the presence of vaguely concentric and  elevated circles by SEM. The PLs were polymorphic but largely spindle?shaped. The GRs  were rounded to ovoid with relatively small and eccentric nucleus. The SPs were also  rounded to ovoid with cytoplasm appearing lobulated. The ADs were rounded to elongate  with cytoplasm containing lipid droplets. The OEs were rounded, and mostly large. The PL  and GR remained relatively high and SP, AD and OE low throughout the postembryonic  development. The VEs, were greatly elongated and narrow cells with pointed ends. The POs  were flat cells with three or more cytoplasmic arms projecting from a central body. These  later cells appear for a limited period only in the early pupa. The THC steadily decreases  during the developmental stages, attains its peak in the late 5th (prepupa) instar and steeply  declines in the pupa.

N2  - The predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot is an economically  important species in integrated mite pest management and biological control of spider mites  in many countries throughout the world. For optimal biological mite management, it is  important to know if acaricides have adverse undesirable effects on the predatory mites. The  toxic effects of hexythiazox (Nisorun®, EC 10%), fenpyroximate (Ortus®, SC 5%) and  abamectin (Vertimec®, EC 1.8%) on P. persimilis were evaluated. The acaricides were  applied on detached bean leaves using a Potter Tower spray which deposited 2 mg spray  solution per cm2. Percent predator mortality was evaluated from the protonymph up to the  adult stage including first five days of the oviposition period. The results showed that the  total effect values of all concentrations of hexythiazox were below the lower threshold thus it  could be considered a harmless acaricide to this predatory mite. In contrast, the total effect  of all concentrations of fenpyroximate, and field, as well as, one half the field concentration  of abamectin were found toxic to predatory mite and above upper threshold.

N2  - Differences in feeding position consequently affect the benefits of  myrmecophily for different aphid species. Tending also seems to be associated with  differences in the honeydew quality and quantity of the aphids. This study yielded 16 ant  species associated with 19 aphid species. The most encountered ant species that associated  with many aphid species were Camponotus aethiops (Latreille), Camponotus piceus  (Leach), Formica glauca Ruzsky, Lasius paralienus Seifert, Crematogaster sordidula  (Nylander). On the other hand, the ant species that associated with only 1 aphid species  were Aphis chloris Koch, Aphis euphorbiae Kaltenbach, Aphis fabae ssp. circiiacanthoidis  Scopoli, Aphis gossypii Glover, Aphis nasturtii Kaltenbach, Aphis verbasci Schrank,  Brachcaudus helicrysi (Kaltenbach), Hyadaphis foeniculi (Passerini), Hydaphias hofmanni  Börner and Protaphis terricola Rondani. The results indicated that the ant-aphid  interaction is important on biological control.

N2  - Population density and spatial distribution pattern of Tetranychus urticae  Koch on seven soybean varieties including: Williams, Tellar, Zane, Sahar, Dpx, L17, Sari and  one genotype, Ks3494, were determined in Tehran region, during 2007. The mean  population density of the T. urticae per leaf on L17 variety (14.15) was significantly more  than other varieties and the genotype of soybean. The lower density of the mite population  was observed on Zane and Ks3494 (6.1 and 4.65 mite per leaf, respectively). Spatial  distribution pattern of T. urticae was determined on these varieties of soybean using Index  of dispersion, Regression models (Taylor and Iwao), Morisita's coefficient and Lloyd's mean  crowding. The index of dispersion, Morisita's index and Lloyd's mean crowding indicated an  aggregated pattern for spatial distribution of this mite in all soybean varieties and the  genotype. The spatial distribution pattern of this pest using Taylor's power law and Iwao's  patchiness in most cases was aggregated and in few cases random. It could be concluded  that different varieties of soybean can affect bionomics of T. urticae.

N2  - In this study, the vertical distributions of soil mites were investigated at five  sampling areas. In the sampling areas 3277 individuals belonging to four orders were  obtained. The amount of the orders are as follows: 83.5% Oribatida, 13.9% Gamasida, 2.2%  Actinedida, 0.4% Acaridida. It was determined that the maximum population density was in  the litter (34%) and the minimum population density was at the depth of 10-15cm (14%).  The soil mites abundance and seasonal differences (P<0.001), depth (P<0.001), different  plant species (P<0.001) were statistically significant. These results are discussed and  recommendations for future work are proposed.

N2  - Investigations on the distribution and the infestation ratio of Ceratitis capitata  on pome and stone fruits were carried out between 2000-2002 in Isparta and Burdur  provinces, Turkey. The localities and the crops that the adults of the pest were captured by  traps as follows: Isparta: Peach: Tepeli, Yukarıgökdere, Gönen; peach and apple:  Büyükgökçeli, Yazısöğüt and Sav; Burdur: peach, pear, apple and quince: Gündoğdu, apple:  Karapınar, peach: Kuruçay and Düğer. The pest was not found in any other localities  surveyed. Emerging period of the adults was coinciding with the harvest time. Therefore  there was no damage and hence no economic loss on the harvested fruits. On the other  hand, fruits could not be picked from the 50 % of the ungrafted peach plants and 40 % of the  fruits left on the trees after harvest were found to be infested with C. capitata larvae. This  ratio was determined to be 80-100 % on the fallen fruits. It was determined with this study  that Golden apple was suitable host for laying eggs, developing larvae and also forming  generations for C. capitata in laboratory conditions. It was put forward with this study that,  as the adult population increases on the fruit maturing period no economic damage occurs if  the fruits are harvested on time without any delay. It was also determined that, it is better  to pick and eradicate the left peach, apple and pear fruits on trees and fallen ones which  serve as infection sources in order to reduce the adult population.

N2  - Rice striped stem borer is a cosmopolitan pest that widely distributed in  different regions of northen Iran and spraying with diazinon is the most common procedure  to control this pest. We evaluated comparative physiological effects of diazinon spraying on  the three populations of Chilo suppresalis collected from Gourabzarmikh (Go),  Sheikhmahale (Sh) and Rasht (Ra) in Iran. The determination of physiological effects of  diazinon, activity levels of some enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase, alanin  aminotransferase, a-amylase, ATPase and lactate dehydrogenase was evaluated. Results  showed that aspartate aminotransferase and alanin aminotransferase didn't have significant  difference. Activity level of a-amylase, ATPase, LDH also demonstrated significantly  different so that Go population was at a higher activity level of these enzyme than the other  two populations. Glucose and protein amount showed a significant difference and their  amount in Go population was higher than Sh and Ra populations. It is inferred that diazinon  treatment decreased activity levels of several enzymes, ATPases, LDH and a-amylase, that  had a significant effect on metabolism of nutrients in insect's body. This parameter could be  used instead of mortality percent for efficiency of chemicals that would decrease times of  spraying and prevent resistance to insecticides, environmental pollution and non-targent  toxicity.

The reliable sample size (number of leaves) with maximum variation of 5.33% was about 130. Index of dispersion, regression models (Taylor and Iwao), Morisita?s index and Lloyd?s mean crowding to mean were used to estimate spatial distribution pattern of these mites. The results indicated that the highest population density of C. irani, B. rubrioculus and Z. mali was in 19th August (13.45 per leaf), 9th August (0.615 per leaf) and 9th August (1.161 per leaf), respectively. Index of dispersion, regression models (Taylor and Iwao), Morisita?s index and Lloyd?s mean crowding to mean showed an aggregated distribution for all species. The linear regression between predator and preys population densities showed a density-dependant predation by Z. mali on C. irani and B. rubrioculus. Spatial distribution parameters of tetranychoid mites and their predator can be used to outline a sampling program, estimate population density of these mites and efficiency of the predator for using in orchards IPM

N2  - Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) is one of the most important pests in northern forests of Iran. For better understanding of the interaction between the pest and plant, the biochemical traits of larval body including glucose, cholesterol, protein, urea and also activity levels of alanin and aspartate amino transferase (ALT & AST) were measured in the 4th instar larvae fed by different clones of Populus deltoiedes, P. euramerican and P. caspica. Larval feeding on different clones of poplar caused considerable biochemical changes in their body. The results showed that glucose fluctuated in the body of these larvae from 35 to 93.3 mg/dl and its highest amount was observed in the larvae fed by P. e. triplo. Feeding on the leaves of P. deltoiedes caused cholesterol enhancement and in all the treatments ALT and AST activity levels followed the same pattern and AST was always higher than ALT. A considerable correlation was shown between these two enzymes while their activity levels were lower in the larvae fed on P. euramerican and P. caspica. Data outlined a negative correlation between glucose and other compounds in a way that if the metabolism was in the favor of carbohydrates, proteins and sterols decreased.

N2  - The resistance mechanisms to oxydemeton-methyl were surveyed in two Iranian strains of the two spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch. Bioassay was carried out on two strains, collected from Tehran and Rasht using a dipping method. The results of bioassay indicated that resistance ratio was 20.47 for resistant strain. The activity of esterase and glutathione S¬ transferase in resistant and susceptible strains showed that one of resistance mechanisms to oxydemeton-methyl was esterase-based resistance and glutathione S-transferase. The esterase activity of the resistant strain was 2.5 and 2.14-fold higher than those of the susceptible strain for &#945;-naphtyl acetate (&#945;-NA) and &#946;-naphtyl acetate (&#946;-NA) respectively. The kinetic characteristics acetylcholinesterase (AChE) showed that the AChE of resistant strain had lower affinity to artificial substrates; acetylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine than that of susceptible strain. I50 of oxydemeton-methyl for resistant and susceptible strains were 2.68×10 M and 7.79×10 M respectively. The results suggested that AChE of resistant is insensitive to oxydemeton-methyl and ratio of AChE insensitivity of resistant to susceptible strain were 3.49 and 7.8-fold to oxydemeton-methyl and paraoxon, respectively.

N2  - Olive psyllid Euphyllura olivina Costa is the most important pest of olive trees in Tarom region. The results of recent investigations on controlling overwintering adults of olive psyllid using emulsifible oil instead of summer insecticides spraying, show very precise control and farmers apply these successfully in  their gardens. In order to study the  effects of oil spraying in winter and autumn and also its feasible phytotoxicity on olive trees.This study carried out as a factorial experiment in completely randomized design block considering oil dosage and time of spraying as factors. The results showed no significant differences between oil treatments but there was a significant difference among different times of spraying. Therefore with the progress of  the season, sensitivity of overwintering adults of olive psyllid and also the percentage of control  increased. Survey of 50 fruits weight indicated that 3% oil treatment decreased yield and caused phytotoxicity during November, December and March. According to this study, early March application of 2% oil is the best choice to control olive psyllid and  3% oil  in February or 1% oil in March are recommended as alternatives

N2  - Olive leaf worm, as a quarantine pest in Iran, was reported in olive orchards in Roudbar city for the first time in August 1999. This insect is dispersed in Italy, Spain, Greece, west Asia, North Africa, Portugal, Sweden, Poland, Japan and tropical regions in America. The most important damage of the pest occurs on young trees, nurseries and shoots of old trees. The young larva of the pest feed beneath the leaves and as they grow larger, they consume entire leaves and buds. The he second generation, if they are abundant, feed on fruits and seeds as well. In order to control this important pest, it certain biological aspects were studied under constant laboratory conditions at 27 °C, 65% relative humidity and 16 hours photoperiod during 1999 in Agricultural Research Center of Zandjan province using caged individual 2- year old potted olive trees of yellow cultivator. According to the results the mean developmental time, from the egg through the adult stages, lasted for 34.9 days. The average generation time, under above-mentioned conditions, was estimated to be 38 days so that it could produce 9 generations per year. The sex ratio was shown to be 1: 1.12 (male: female). The percentage mortality of immature stages appeared to be 49.45%. The mean fecundity of females was 385 (with a range of 212 - 419) with adult longevity of 14.1 (range: 8 - 26) and 12.3 days (range: 7 and max 21) for male and female individuals, respectively

N2  - A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of flubendiamide as an IPM component for the management of brinjal shoot and fruit borer and eight IPM packages were evaluated. Among the different IPM packages, package 6 (mechanical control + potash @100 kg/ha + field sanitation in combination with flubendiamide 24WG applied at 5% level of shoot and fruit infestation) showed the better performance by reducing 80.63% fruit infestation over control  and produced the highest number of healthy and total fruits/plant (25.0 and 27.20, respectively). The same package also increased 108.83% healthy fruit yield and decreased 74.13% infested fruit yield over control. The highest benefit cost ratio (5.53) was recorded in IPM package 2 (Potash @100 kg/ha + flubendiamide 24WG applied at 5% level of fruit infestation), where 9 sprays were required. The BCR of 4.12 and 4.00 was obtained in IPM package 6 and package 5 with 8 and 5 sprays, respectively. The results of this study suggested that application of flubendiamide at 5% level of fruit infestation in combination with mechanical control + potash @ 100 kg/ha + field sanitation may be used for the management of brinjal shoot and fruit borer.

Different stages of Aphis fabae and its host plant were used.  Average preadult period of male and female adult parasitoids were 13.18 ± 0.28 and 13.68 ± 0.27 days, respectively.  There were no significant differences between male and female wasps longevity ( P>0.05). There was a significant difference between preadult period of female  and male parasitoids on different life stages of Aphis fabae ( P < 0.05). Diet affected significantly the female parasitoid longevity (P<0.05).  Longevity was longer when the females were fed on 30% honey solution and the shortest when they had no access to host plant, host, water and honey solution. Sex ratio changed towards males as temperature increased. Data analysis revealed that female parasitoids prefer  Aphis fabae over Aphis craccivora Koch and Aphis nerri for oviposition ( P< 0.05). The lowest oviposition preference was shown for Aphis nerri. Mean lifetime fertility of Lysiphlebus fabarum  was 122 ± 27.28 offsprings/ female on Aphis fabae.   The intrinsic rate of increase(rm), mean generation time, doubling time and rate of increase per week (RW ) were   0.28, 16.31 days, 2.47 days, and 7.11, respectively.

N2  - In order to identify and determine of ¥á-amylase expressing in various developmental stages of Eurygaster maura, a series of biochemical and enzymatic experiments was carried out. For this goal midgut ¥á-amylase was isolated and characterized. Enzyme samples from midguts of adults were prepared by the method of Cohen with slight modifications. The ¥á-amylase activity was assayed by the dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) procedure, using 1% soluble starch as substrate. Then absorbance was read at 540 nm by spectrophotometer. Amylase activity was detected in the midgut of the insects which were collected from wheat fields during spring.  Amylase activity in the midgut of feeding insects was 0.083 U/insect. ¥á-amylase activity was detected in the various  nymphal stage. The results show that ¥á-amylase activity in the immature stages increase constantly up to the third-instar. There were no significant differences of enzyme activity between third, fourth, fifth nymphal stages and adults (0.0071 - 0.0083 (U/insect)). ¥á-amylase activity  in first-nymphal stage was 0.0046 U/insect. Optimum temperature for the enzyme activity was determined to be between 30 to 40 ¢ªC. Optimum pH value for amylase was 6.5-7.

N2  - The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, is very polyphagous and considered a serious pest world-wide. The divers host plant species may have been the different effects of this pest; we therefore compared population growth parameters of T. urticae reared on three commonly grown and important legumes in Iran (soybean, cowpea and bean). The life table parameters were estimated at 25 ± 1oC, 60 ± 10% RH, and a photoperiod of 18:6 h (L: D). Egg hatchability, development time and survival to adult stage were similar among cultivars, but we detected significant variation in fecundity and longevity, resulting in large differences for population growth parameters such as the intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm), net reproductive rate (R0), finite rate of increase (ë) and doubling time (DT). Soybean was the most favorable host for two-spotted spider mites with rm = 0.296 (offsprings/female/day), followed by cowpea (0.242) and bean (0.230). The slowest population growth was observed on the bean species with rm = 0.214. These findings indicate that the choice of host plant species will affect how fast spider mite populations reach damaging levels in a culture.

N2  - The calling behaviour of virgin female of carob moth, Ectomyelois ceratoniae (Zeller) (Lep.:Pyralidae) was studied at three different constant temperatures under laboratory conditions. Most virgin females called during the first and fewer during second scotophase after emergence, regardless of the temperature. Moths maintained at 30°C started calling significantly later in the scotophase than those maintained at 20 or 25°C. At all temperature regimes, the mean onset time of calling (MOTC) advanced from about 453rd to 345th minute after the onset of the scotophase, and the mean time spent calling (MTSC) increased by >30 minutes over the 8 days. Cohorts of females were also observed at two different periods in middle summer-late summer (early August and early September 2006) in the field to examine the effect of fluctuating abiotic conditions (temperature, wind velocity) and age on calling behaviour. All females started calling from eclosion day on. Calling started from the 370 to 280 minutes of scotophase depending on the age of the females and the mean time spent calling (MTSC) increased by >100 minutes over the 8 days. Age-related changes in the mean onset time of calling and the mean time spent calling were much less evident under field conditions, due to the inhibitory effects of low temperatures and high winds on female calling activity

N2  - Hypolixus truncatulus (F.) has been observed as a major pest of cultivated amaranthus viz., Amaranthus caudatus L. in the Jammu region whose leaves are used as greens and seeds for medicinal purposes. Maximum of 49 specimens at different stages of development were recorded (±SE) from a single plant. Weevils were found to breed from April to November and overwinter in soil or inside the debris of harvested plants. Adults defoliate the plants while larvae feed on internal tissues of the stem and branches to form irregular zigzag tunnels resulting in galls. Infestation varies from 34.96 to 82.3% with an average of 62.52% ±21.4. Mating normally lasts for one and half an hour. Female after 20-40 minutes of copulation commences laying eggs singly in the excavated hole in the stem, branches, petiole or midrib of the leaves. Incubation varies between 3-6 days with an average of 4.2±0.36 days. Larva when taken out of the stem or branch shows a typical C-shaped curvature. Larval period ranges from 42-45 days with an average of 43.6±0.45 days. Pupal period ranges from 12-15 days with an average of 13.5±0.43 days. Total life cycle takes 58-64 days with a mean of 61.10±0.71 days. At least three overlapping generations were observed from April to November

With this aim, the heparinized blood samples obtained from two non-smoking individuals with no history of exposure to any toxic agent.  The water soluble extracts containing all body parts were sterilized and added to the culture tubes at different concentrations (10-100 mg/L). SCEs were visualized by a combination of Fluorescent and Giemsa (FPG) techniques. In comparison to control sets, the treatments of different concentrations of water soluble insect extracts did not elevate (p<0.05) the frequencies of SCEs. Furthermore, the present findings revealed that human blood cultures may be a useful in vitro system for evaluating the mutagenic potential of edible insect species

N2  - The Sunn pest, Eurygaster integriceps, a key constraint on increasing wheat production in the wide area, causes severe damage to the vegetative growth stage of wheat in the early season. In this study, the effects of selected biopesticides and insect growth regulators were investigated to open a new gate for pesticide application against this major pest of wheat fiels. Five concentrations of different chemicals were used for toxicity and evaluation of LC50 values along with a control treated with acetone. Comparison of  LC50 values showed that A. annua extract, B. bassiana secondary metabolites and Buprofezin were more effective than  pyriproxyfen and metoxyphenozide because of lower amount of  LC50. Comparison of mortality percentage of this chemicals demonstrated the significant differences and the most percentage (100%) was observed in A. annua extract, B. bassiana secondary metabolites and Buprofezin treatments. Elucidation of the mode of action of chemicals is of practical importance for insect control because it may give useful information on the appropriate formulation types. This study has further confirmed the insecticidal potential of metabolic compound produced by A. annua, B. bassiana, pyriproxyfen, metoxyphenozide and buprefezin. In the future we can expect additional development and more advanced final adjustment of the insecticides and application techniques and obtaining new knowledge about physical-chemical properties that determine their destiny in the environment and in biological systems

N2  - Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) from two populations (Tehran and Shiraz) of the sunn pest Eurygaster integriceps Puton (Heteroptera: Scutellaridae) were characterized through in vitro colorimetric assays. GSTs showed higher activity peaks at pH 5-6. The Km-values for GSTs were different between populations in which Shiraz population had higher Vmax and lower Km values when using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as substrate (and a fixed concentration of reduced glutathione?GSH). In addition, Native-PAGE electrophoresis showed a higher isoenzymatic patterns for Shiraz population compared with Tehran one. These results provide evidence of the involvement of enhanced GST activity as an additional organophosphorus-resistant mechanism in at least some sunn pest populations from Iran

N2  - Controlled atmosphere is efficient way to control of stored-product insects. 1,8-Cineole as main component of Eucalyptus spp. has high toxicity on insects. Toxicity of 1,8-Cineole at low pressure was performed against two most common stored-product insects, Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) and Tribolium Castaneum (Herbst) in two time, at three different pressure (Normal pressure, 100 mm Hg, 150 mm Hg). LD50 values of 1,8-Cineole fumigant toxicity in 12 h and 24 h for C. maculatus and T. Castaneum in  normal atmosphere pressure of Urmia (Iran) (653 mm Hg) were 275.6, 201.5, 452.2 and 265.1 µl/l air, respectively. LD50 values of 1,8-Cineole fumigant toxicity plus reduced atmosphere pressure in 100 mm Hg, in 12 & 24 h for mentioned insects were 193.5, 118.3, 331.7 and 176.8   µl/l air, and in 150 mm Hg were 210.3, 151.5, 381.4 and 214.7 µl/l air, respectively. Results have been shown that insects susceptibility to 1,8-Cineole, had significant enhancement by reduction in pressure of atmosphere. Toxicity of 1,8-Cineole at reduced pressures was strongly influenced by ambient time. Application of integrated management by essential oils and physical practices such as reduced atmosphere pressure has potential efficacy for stored-product pests control

N2  - Five bacterial strains of Photorhabdus and six strains of Xenorhabdus originating from several geographical isolates of entomopathogenic nematodes have been studied moleculary to distinguish their position among the well defined species. Constructed phylogenetic trees based on the sequences of 16S-rRNA showed all of the studied Photorhabdus belong to the P. luminescens subsp. lumondii and Xenorhabdus were identified as X. bovienii, X. nematophilus and X. budapestensis. Among the Steinernema feltiae symbiont?s one isolate named Xenorhabdus sp. IRA22 made a nearly distinct branch in the group and therefore it is possible to represent new species.

N2  - During the year 2007, antixenosis resistance mechanism of 4 poplar species, including Populus alba, P. deltoides, P. euramericana and P. nigra, and 15 related clones was evaluated against the willow and poplar lace-bug, Monosteira unicostata, one of the most important pests of these trees. Poplar cuts, bearing 3-5 uniform and similar leaves, of each species were taken. The adult bugs previously developed under natural conditions on one poplar species, P. alba, were collected and released in a designed olfactometer while placing in a germinator (at temperature 24±0.1 ºC, 50 % relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 16L:8D). The experiment was carried out with 10 replications. The numbers of male and female bugs attracted to each poplar clones were counted and recorded after 24 hours. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference (P<0.01) in numbers of attracted lace-bugs to the poplar species and clones. The most lace-bug numbers were attracted to P. nigra and P. alba respectively, and the lowest attraction of lace-bugs was observed in P. euramericana and P. deltoides. Among the poplar clones, the comparison of means showed that P. n. 42.78, P. n. 56.53 and P. n. betulifolia attracted the most adult bugs and were considered as the most susceptible clones, while P. d. missouriensis, P. e. vernirubensis and P. e. triplo were the most resistant clones

N2  - The occurrence of Diaretiella rapae parasitizing Lipaphis erysimi in Mustard variety Pusa bold (Brassica juncea) was evaluated. Successful parasitism was 75.46% and 68.96% during 2006-07, 2007-08 respectively. Correlation coefficient of average per cent relative humidity with both aphid (r=-0.52) and parasitoid (r=-0.59) were negatively significant whereas day (r=0.65) and the night temperature (r=0.61) had significant positive correlations with the parasitoid population only. The best fitted polynomial regression equation indicated that 30-60% variability of the aphid population could be explained by the different weather parameters, while 11-50% variability of the parasitoid population could be explained by weather parameters.

N2  - Sunn pest (Eurygaster integriceps Puton) (Heteroptera: Scutelleridae), is one of the most serious insect pests of wheat and barley in Iran and in the neighboring countries. In Iran since 1950?s control of Sunn pest was mainly based on chemical control especially of DDT followed by organophosphorus insecticide such as fenitrothion (since 1970?s). In the current study susceptibility of the two geographic populations (Mazandaran and Tehran provinces) of the insect to fenitrothion was assessed using bioassays as well as enzymatic evaluations. Calculted LD50 values against adult insects of Tehran and Mazandaran populations were 0.19 and 0.08 µg insect-1, respectively. Residual assays against second-instar nymphs of the Sunn pest showed that LC50 value for Tehran strain was 1.71 ppm while LC50 value for Mazandaran strain was 0.77 ppm. These data indicated that Tehran colony is less susceptible to insecticide than the Mazandaran colony. These findings were further supported by determination of esterase activity and I50 values of the two populations. Esterase activity of female individuals of Tehran and Mazandaran colonies to 1-NA (alpha naphthylacetate) substrate was 1.16 and 0.68 ìM product/min/mg protein, respectively. The female individuals of Tehran population contained almost twice as much esterase activity as Mazandaran population. Analysis of variance showed that there were significant differences between esterase activity of male and female and between two populations (P < 0.05).

N2  - The Sun pest, Eurygaster integriceps Puton (Hemiptera: Scutelleridae), is a serious pest of wheat. In addition to wheat, it feeds on variety of graminous plant species including barley and rye as well as many grasses.  Aim of the current study was to determine the effect of host plant on body weight, lipid and protein content of the adult Sunn pest. Results showed that host plant affected body weight of the Sunn pest. For example adult produced from nymphs grown on wheat and barley had more weight than those of rye. Also, it was observed that the adult females were produced from nymphs grown on wheat had the highest weight followed by barley and rye. Lipid content also was different based on the type of food the insect received. As can be seen the adult female were produced from nymphs grown on wheat had the highest lipid content weight followed by barley and rye. For example the amount of lipid content of the adult female grown on wheat, barley and rye was 32, 28, and 23 mg, respectively. Thus, it is concluded that host plant has profound effect on body weight, body fat content and body protein content of the adult insect which all of these parameters (body weight, body lipid content and body protein content) have important effect on the insect diapauses and the insect reproduction

N2  - The experiment was conducted to investigate the insecticidal potency of black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) seed powder and red pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) fruit powder, against two important stored-product pests. These powders were mixed with 20 g wheat grains as direct admixtures at five different rates viz, 0, 0.15, 0.2, 0.27, 0.37 and 0.5% (w/w) for black pepper and 0, 0.5, 0.85, 1.5, 3 and 5% (w/w) for red pepper to assess for mortality and reduction of Fl progeny. The treated grains were infested with 20 adults. All insects were removed after 14 days and the experiments were monitored for the extra 36 days in order to count the number of emerged adults. The results revealed that black pepper at 0.5% concentration caused 100% mortality of S. granarius in the first five days, also R. dominica showed complete mortality at 5% level after 14 days, but red pepper did not cause complete mortality on two insects after 14 days. Both plant materials caused complete reduction in Fl progeny of S. granarius at highest tested dosages. Also they significantly reduced F1 progeny emergence of R. dominica. This plant powders exhibited promising potential in protecting wheat grains against two species of insects.

N2  - Two powdered spices, turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) and cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Ness.) were evaluated for their ability to protect stored wheat grains against infestation by two important stored-product pests. The spices were added separately to 20 g wheat grains as direct admixtures at five different rates 0.5, 0.85, 1.5, 3 and 5% (w/w) to assess for mortality and reduction of F1 progeny. Twenty adult insects were released in each container. All tested insects were removed after 14 days and the experiments were monitored for the following 36 days in order to count the number of emerged adults. Each of the experiments was performed in four replicates. The results revealed that powders had significant insecticidal effects on the adults of both insects. The toxicities of these powders increased with an increase in dosage as well as an increase in the period of exposure to the plant materials. Powders at 5% (w/w) exhibited a significant toxicity on the adults of both pests, but did not cause complete mortality. Turmeric is more effective than cinnamon against both insects and S. granarius adults were more sensitive than R. dominica. Moreover, they caused complete reduction in F1 progeny of both insects at the highest dosages

N2  - Bioindicators are broadly used in scientific research to quantify environmental impacts such as the effects of disturbances due to anthropogenic activities. Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) are frequently used to indicate habitat alteration since they are affected by anthropogenic activities such as urbanization, crop and forest management, overgrazing by domestic livestock, tourist flow in natural landscapes and soil pollution. Moreover carabids are well known both taxonomically and ecologically, are extremely sensitive to several abiotic and biotic factors, respond quickly to habitat alteration and can be easily and cost-effectively collected by using classic pitfall traps. For these reasons this group of ground-dwelling arthropods are increasingly being used in ecological studies in order to evaluate the environmental impacts of man in terrestrial ecosystems. In this work we present several case studies where carabids were employed as a bioindicator group of metal pollution

N2  - The banana pseudostem weevil Odoiporus longicollis Olivier has been recorded for the first time in Poonch and Rajouri districts of Jammu region as a major pest of banana plant (Musa spp.) which are grown in patches in this area. Both larvae and adults caused extensive tunelling in the leaf sheaths as well as in core region. Percentage incidence ranged between 47-61.2 per cent with a mean of 54.55±2.28 per cent. Mating occurs in mating spaces between leaf sheaths. One egg laid in one air chamber. Egg is cylindrical, yellowish white. Larvae are apodous, soft, and cylindrical with dark brown head and pass through five larval instars. Elongated cylindrical cocoons are formed for pupation by winding short pieces of fibrous materials of the leaf sheath. The pests breed throughout the year and do not undergo winter rest. Black and reddish brown adults were recorded from the splitted pseudostems of the damaged banana plants and colour difference represents a phenomenon of non sex limited variation in conspecific sympatric phena of the pest.

N2  - The feasibility of using different types of microwave radiation and cold storage to control the Callosobruchus maculatus (F) in stored grains was evaluated. The mortality rate of adult insects at 200 W power level, different exposure times (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 min) and 48 h cold storage period was determined. Moreover, different age groups of C. maculatus´s eggs were exposed to 100 W power level and 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 min exposure periods at 48 h cold storage period. There was a direct relationship between mortality rate and exposure times. Furthermore, the results imply a significant difference in susceptibility of adult insects in using radiation priori or post cold storage treatment. Likewise, a direct positive relationship between mortality rates and microwave radiation exposure times was observed. At the power level of 100 W and 48 h cold storage period, 3-4 days-old eggs were more tolerant than the other age groups, followed by 4-5, 1-2, 2-3 and 0-1 days-old eggs

N2  - White peach scale, Pseudaulacaspis pentagona Targioni, as a common pest of peach, has become the most important pest of peach in Iran. We tested the effect of five insecticides including, diazinon, azinphosmethyl, chlorpyrifos, methoxyfenozide, spinnosad and mineral oil on the adult stage of white peach scale. Experiments were done under laboratory conditions (22 ± 2 °C and 60 ± 5 % RH). Toxicity of various insecticides to P. pentagona was assessed by dipping method (infested branches to scale dipping in solutions of insecticides for 10 S). In all treatments, the mortality percentage was determined after 24 h. Bioassay results showed that chlorpyrifos had high toxicity on white peach scale. The LC90 values were 11636.94, 12243.03, 14181.02, 17254.60, 21603.60 and 30954.77ppm for chlorpyrifos, diazinon, azinphosmethyl, mineral oil, spinosad and methoxyfenozide, respectively. Mineral oil had the moderate toxic effect on P. pentagona; thus the use of mineral oil to prevent the build-up of the pest population could be a useful alternative to other insecticides or mixed with them because of its least adverse effects on human and environment

N2  - In the present study, the essential oil isolated from aerial parts of A. foeniculum by Clevenger apparatus was analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Methyl chavicol was main component of oil. Insecticidal activity of this essential oil was evaluated by fumigation method against E. kuehniella and P. interpunctella. Mortality was recorded daily for four days after treatment. P. interpunctella (LC50 = 16.535 µlL-1) was more susceptible than E. kuehniella (LD50 = 23.075 µlL-1) at 24 h after treatment. In general, mortality, increased as the doses of essential oil and exposure period increased. These results showed that the A. foeniculum oil could be used in grain storage in order to decrease detrimental effects and risk of utilization synthetic insecticides.

N2  - The responses of oribatid communities to heavy metal contamination were studied. Concentration of cadmium, copper, lead and zinc in oribatid species along Ismailia water canal, Egypt was measured. Metal levels observed in both soil and irrigation water was compared with standard values of FAO and established permissible levels reported by different authors. Mean concentration of heavy metals determined in irrigation water were much above the recommended levels. Concentrations of all the metals (mg kg&#8722;1 dry weight) in the studied agricultural soil were below the permissible level standard. The comparison of mean concentrations of heavy metal in examined soil with that of typical uncontaminated soil in this area revealed that Ismailia water canal using in irrigation of agricultural soil has increased the levels of heavy metals. All studied oribatid species appeared to be accumulator's different amount of heavy metals characterized by the highest bioconcentration factors. The results of the study show that the abundance and structure of the soil oribatid communities in the sampling locations were not influenced by levels of heavy metals in the soil. They also show that the diversity index can be valuable tools for assessing the impact of pollutants on different species of oribatid mites

N2  - The pollination of flowering plants is an important ecological service in natural and agricultural ecosystems. The majority of angiosperm plants rely on animals for pollination. The coevoulution of bees and flowers has resulted in special morphological adaptations for both insects and plants, and the need of some plants for pollination by bees are absolute. One of the major forage corps in Egypt and other part of the world is alfalfa. The leafcutting bees are very important pollinator of alfalfa, different natural nests had been found in Eastern part of Egypt but these nests under a high risk due to construction of news house instead of old mud wall houses. Foam nests had been created yearly from 2003 and used as hives for conservation of bees and used it for alfalfa pollination. The impact of using leafcutting hives proved a high seed production and easy to handle by farmers, the hives are very easy for preservation, storage and reuse.

N2  - Chromatomyia horticola Goureau (Diptera: Agromyzidae) is a pest of canola crop, Brassica napus L., in the Ardabil region. The resistance of six canola cultivars to C. horticola was studied in the two following experiments: (1) host feeding selection and (2) life cycle study. The host feeding selection of females, were carried out in a greenhouse at 23±1oC, 50±5% RH and 14L:10D; the number of punctures and mines on Hyola401, RGS003 and Opera was significantly lower than that on Talayh. In the life cycle study, the development, survivorship and reproduction of C. horticola raised on five canola cultivars, was studied under defined condition. The female lifetime of leafminer was 27.43d on Talayh, 28.67d on Zarfam, 29.8d on RGS003, 30.2d on Hyola401 and 32.5d on Opera; the female lifetime on Opera, Hyola401 and RGS003 was significantly longer than that on Talayh. The mean lifetime fecundity of leafminer on Talayh, Zarfam, RGS003, Hyola401 and Opera was 80.15, 82.18, 74.4, 76.1 and 67.57 eggs, respectively. Based on these results, we conclude that Talayh is the most suitable and Opera is the least suitable host plant for C. horticola

N2  - Sunn Pest, Eurygaster integriceps (Puton) (Heteroptera: Scutelleridae) is a serious pest of wheat and barley in countries of west and central Asia. The contents of metathoracic glands (MTG) of adults of the sunn pest E. integriceps were tested by two methods in vitro and in vivo. Volatiles were collected by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibers. Chemical composition of the glandular secretion was identified by gas chromatography (GC), coupled GC-mass spectrometry, matching retention times and mass spectra with those of authentic samples. No sexual dimorphism exists in the glandular composition in this species. A total of 7 compounds (E)-2-Hexenal, 2(5H)-Furanone, 5-Ethyle, 2-Hexen-1-ol, acetate, Limonene, 5-Decyne, Tridecane and Nonadecane were identified. Among the identified compounds (E)-2-Hexenal and Tridecane comprised nearly 95% of the total secretion in both females and males. In the MTG of both females and males of E. integriceps, (E)-2-Hexenal was determined in maximum amount and 2(5H)-Furanone,5-Ethyle was determined in minimum amount. Comparing results of in vitro and in vivo SPME sampling methods indicates that in-vivo method had high quality for detecting compounds than in vitro method. Quantity and area under GC peaks increased in in vivo method

N2  - Metathoracic scent glands could only be observed in adults of Heteroptera. These glands are located between metathoracic legs which pour open near leg?s coxa. Reservoirs are the main part of glands. Metathoracic scent glands of E. integriceps have an orange median reservoir and two colorless secretory tubules that their secretions directly release to median reservoir. Wave shaped accessory glands can be observed on the median reservoir. Dimension of glands directly relates with rate of secretion. Morphological characters of active and hibernating populations of sunn pest scent glands were studied in collected populations from Hamedan and Tabriz. After dissection scent gland dimension was measured by micrometer. Width and length of glands in widest and longest region were measured. Mean dimension of scent glands in active populations of Hamedan and Tabriz were 2.58±0.049 and 2.6±0.083 mm in males and 2.47±0.083 and 2.45±0.102 mm in females respectively. Also these dimensions in males of Hamedan and Tabriz overwriting Populations were 2.75±.088 and 2.79±0.082 mm and in females were 2.7±0.07 and 2.69±0.076 mm. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences in male and female glands dimension of each population. Glands dimension in active and Hibernating populations differed significantly (p<0.05)

N2  - Whitefly, Bemisia tabaci is an important sucking pest of field, horticultural and ornamental plants causing feeding injuries besides spreading disease by acting as a vector of Gemini viruses. The polyphagous nature of the pest makes it as a highly complex species. The influence of six host plants utilized by the species on the population differences at molecular level was attempted using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Seven RAPD primers screened produced 232 DNA fragments 223 of these fragments were polymorphic. While the other nine fragments detected as common among the six tested populations. Total number of bands obtained from each primer ranged from 23- 44 with an average of 33.14 bands per primer. Phylogenetic relationships among the studied populations using this technique clearly separated these six populations into two main clusters with similarity matrix percentage of 88% and 64%. These results indicated that B. tabaci may have different genotypes on adaptations to certain host plant species in Egypt.

N2  - This study attempts to establish the combined effect of Encarsia inaron in junction with pyriproxyfen against Trialeurodes vaporariorum under greenhouse conditions. In the present study, we have found pyriproxyfen to be compatible with E. inaron in the control of the greenhouse whitefly. Whitefly mortality in the presence of the parasitoid was 93.9%, significantly higher than the mortality in the control group (37.2%). A non-significant difference between pyriproxyfen versus E. inaron performance was detected. Pyriproxyfen showed a negligible negative impact on the parasitism rates of E. inaron. It could be concluded that the biological control is being used as a complement to, rather than a substitute for, chemical control

N2  - The Russian Wheat Aphid is one of the most important cereal pests in the world. Due to the economic importance of this aphid in most parts of the world and also in Iran, certain studies have been directed towards the introduction of resistant cultivars. In the present study, the resistance associated with antibiosis was sought out at stem elongation growth stage in Alamoot, Alvand, Zarrin, Sabalan and Sardari, the most extensively planted wheat varieties in East Azarbaijan province of Iran. Antibiosis was determined by studying the percentage nymphal survival rate, their development time, fecundity of the first 10 and 15 days of reproductive period, growth index and calculating the relevant intrinsic rate of natural population increase (rm value). ANOVA of data indicated that, regarding the development time of nymphs, fecundity and rm values, there were significant differences between the varieties. The highest and lowest mean survival rate of nymphs also was observed in rearings on Sabalan and Alvand with 77.78 and 66.67 percent respectively. Comparisons of means using Duncan?s multiple range test, showed significant differences (p<%5) in aphid rm values between the varieties. Sabalan had the highest rm value thus regarded as the susceptible variety, while Alvand and Zarrin had the lowest rm values and thus seem to be partially resistant varieties

N2  - The nymphal survival rate; mean development time; adult fecundity (total number of progeny/female produced within the first 10 and 15 days of reproductive stage) and calculating the relevant intrinsic rate of natural population increase (rm value) was measured on five modern Iranian wheat cultivars at the tillering growth stage. The English grain aphid is regarded as one of the most important pests of small grain cereals, especially wheat varieties in many parts of the world. The pest has extended its distribution throughout the wheat fields of Iran and in particular the East Azarbaidjan province. The wheats were of Iranian origin, winter cultivars and hexaploid types, namely Alamoot, Alvand, Zarrin, Sabalan and Sardari, which are the most extensively cultivated in the province. The experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions of 24.2±4.5°C temperature, 55.7±4.6%R.H. and 16:8(L: D) light regime. Aphids which had already been reared on the respective varieties for at least one generation were transferred to the experimental plants. The ANOVA of the data indicated that regarding duration of nymphal development time, adult fecundity and also rm values, there were significant differences (p<0.01) between the varieties. Based on this, the highest (8.70±0.47) and lowest (6.60±0.50) mean nymphal development time was calculated on Zarrin and Sardari respectively. The greatest (75.55±3.30 and 52.60±2.28) and the least (41.55±2.65 and 27.60±2.28) numbers of progeny produced per female within the first 10 and 15 days of larviposition period was observed on Alvand and Sabalan respectively. Moreover, the highest rm value (0.3340±0.0052 and 0.3304±0.0051) obtained for individuals reared on Alvand, with the lowest (0.2444±0.0089 and 0.2379±0.0093) being on Sabalan. Sabalan showed some resistance to the aphid in comparison with the other varieties at the tillering stage, while Zarrin, Sardari and Alamoot were regarded as partially resistant varieties, whilst Alvand appeared to be more susceptible one

N2  - For the first time during the survey of entomopathogenic nematodes in north of Iran, a geographical isolates of  Heterorhabditis recovered from soil using Galleria baiting technique. Based on morphological and molecular characterization this isolates was identified as Heterorhabditis bacteriophora NIR1. Morphometric and morphological comparisons of the new isolate with type species and other described isolates from different areas showed that H. bacteriophora NIR1 is morphologically similar to others but differ from type species in the following cases. For infective juvenile, means of body length (582 vs 570 �m), distance from anterior end to nerve ring (86 vs 83 �m) and esophagus length (121 vs 125 �m) and for male, means of body length (910 vs 820 �m), maximum body width (60 vs 43 �m), anal body width (27 vs 23 �m), esophagus length (114 vs 103 �m), distance from anterior end to excretory pore (155 vs 121 �m) and spicule length (42 vs 40 �m) were different from type isolate.  Molecular studies of rDNA ITS regions showed that the Iranian isolate is closely related to the other described isolates of H. bacteriophora from other area. Sequence length of amplified region of ITS-rDNA of NIR1 isolate (819 base pairs) is the same as in type species. Intraspecific relationships among isolates of H. bacteriophora showed that geographic distribution is associated with the genetic and morphologic differences

N2  - Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are used to control several agriculturally important insect pests of the different orders. In this study the ability of four geographical isolate of Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and three species of Steinernema include S. bicornutum, S. carpocapsae and S. feltiae were investigated for control of Colorado potato beetle in laboratory conditions at 25±2 ºC and photoperiod of 12:12 (L:D). The efficacy of EPNs was tested at five concentrations including 100, 200, 400, 500 and 1000 infective juvenile (IJs) per individual with three methods, filter paper assay, leaf assay and soil assay at four exposure times. In filter paper assay and leaf assay methods, H. bacteriophora IRA10 had the highest toxicity and S. bicornutum IRA7 was the lowest one. There are no significant differences between strains at lowest concentration in all exposure times. In soil assay method, H. bacteriophora IRA12 had the highest mortality percentage and S. bicornutum IRA7 was the lowest one. Our study clearly shows that both species and geographical isolates of same species of etomopathogenic nematodes may have significantly different virulence against specific pest target. Nevertheless these results it is difficult to predict which species/isolate might be the most effective biological control agent for suppression of L. decemlineata in field conditions but at least we can expect that the most effective EPN among studied isolates might be H. bacteriophora IRA10

N2  - Old World or African bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera Hübner (Lep.: Noctuidae) is one of the key pests causing severe yield losses, infesting several crops such as cereals, pulses, cotton, vegetables and fruit crops as well as wild hosts. It is expected that the recognition of intraspecific variation, its nature and scope, may aid our understanding of the pest and also to predict its spatial and temporal occurrence, to devise effective management strategies, and also to characterize pod borer population responses to control measures. The purpose of this study is to estimate the relative importance of generic and environmental effects on characters of pod borer in Iran. Specimens were collected from several provinces in Iran from tomato. The genomic DNA from H. armigera larvae collected during summer 2006-2007 from five  different places were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 10 different SSR primers. The highest numbers of 14 markers were produced by the primer HaSSR1, followed by 9 markers by HaSSR6 with high degree of polymorphism 75?100%. The primers HaSSR6, HaSSR4, HaC87 and HaD47 were found to be highly informative to differentiate populations with a polymorphism information content value of 100 percent. Ten tested SSR primers produced 46 bands in geographical populations. Within population genetic diversity based on Nie s gene index ranged from 0.188 to 0.250  Molecular  variance analysis showed significant within and between population variance. The between and within geographical variance accounted for 13.88 and 86.12 percent of total molecular variance, respectively. Cluster analysis based on molecular data in geographical assigned the studied pod borer moth populations into two groups. In this grouping, group one consisted of Golestan population. The maximum and minimum genetic distances were observed between Gorgan- Mughan (0.21853) and Kermanshah- Shahindej (0.05789). Significant correction was not found between genetic and geographic matrices revealed by Mantel test.

N2  - The pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) is one of the key pests causing severe yield losses in several crops such as cereals, pulses, cotton, vegetables and fruit crops as well as wild hosts in Iran. In this study, shapes and sizes of wings were compared in populations on 4 host plants (cotton, tomato, corn and chickpea) using a land mark ? based geometric morphometric method, analysis of partial warp scores and centroid sizes. The results showed significantly smaller wing size in populations on cotton and a significant host plant?associated shape difference among populations. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) of shape variables in forewings indicated significant differences among populations. Simple analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that the centroid size of cotton populations was significantly smaller than others. The analysis also showed a significant difference between the populations

N2  - Callosobruchus maculatus F. is a major insect pest of stored-grain legumes in many countries. In the present study, fumigant toxicity of essential oils from Lavandula officinalis L., Artemisia dracunculus L. and Heracleum persicum Desf. was assessed on the adults of Callosobruchus maculates. The results indicated that the mortality of adults increased with increased concentration and exposure time. LC50 values for oils from Lavandula officinalis, Artemisia dracunculus and Heracleum persicum were 41.52, 210.61 and 337.58 µlL-1, respectively. Toxicity of Lavandula officinalis oil was more than other two plants (LC50 = 41.52 µlL-1), but the essential oils from all three plants were effective against this pest. Therefore, these essential oils were suggested to be used for Callosobruchus maculates control in stores

N2  - Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has been a useful method for analysis of á-amylases and their isozyme(s). Routinely, for detection of enzyme activity soluble starch (1%) is added at the end of electrophoresis, before staining the gel, which is time consuming and in some cases minor isozyme(s) could not be detected. Thus, we developed a convenient and efficient native page by adding the soluble 0.5% starch at the beginning of electrophoresis as a part of gel components and running at 4 °C. This simple modification should be beneficial for analyzing the both purified and unpurified

N2  - Discrimination of different larval instars of insects is important in morphological, physiological and toxicological studies under laboratory conditions. The morphometric study of different parts of an insect?s body is needed to obtain an index to distinguish different larval instars. In this study, Dyar?s rule stating the ratio of size of each sclerotized body part in successive instars is in a constant range was studied on different larval instars of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. The insects were reared at 26±2°C, 60±5% RH and a photoperiod of 16: 8 (L: D) h. for 10 generations. One hundred larvae of each instar were randomly selected and width of head capsule in widest region, as well as length and width of stigmata located on prothorax and first and last abdominal segments were measured by calibrated micrometer. A frequency distribution plot showed that due to overlap in stigmata dimension, size of the stigmata was not a suitable index for distinguishing different larval instars in this insect. The widths of head capsule for 1st to 6th larval instars were 0.257-0.314, 0.4-0.485, 0.6-0.743, 0.96-1.2, 1.5-1.8 and 2.55-2.8 mm, respectively. Dyar?s ratios for 1st to 6th larval instar intervals were obtained 1.52, 1.512, 1.631, 1.612 and 1.552, respectively. There was no overlap in the data range; therefore, head capsule width can be used with high confidence as an index to distinguish larval instars. Linear regression analysis revealed significant effect of larval instars on head capsule (R2 =0.999). Despite strong relationship between dimension of stigmata and instar numbers, some strong overlapping in stigmata dimensions in subsequent instars decreased the usefulness of stigmata dimensions for instar discrimination. Overlapping particularly in the first abdominal stigmata was more than others

N2  - In this study some properties of Cotton bollworm and Beet army worm midgut protease activity was investigated. Insects were reared on special artificial diets in controlled conditions. Different developmental stages including, larval stages, 5-6 inter-moult period, pre-pupa, male and female pupa and adult?s protease activity measured using azocaseionolytic assay method. Optimum pH and temperature of protease activity determined by testing different pH and temperature gradients. Also protease stability in two different storage conditions (4 and -20 °C) for 15 weeks were studied. Results showed that the optimum temperature for protease activity was 35°C in both insects. Studying the effects of different pH values on protease activity in both insects showed that except pH 13, enzyme activities were not affected by acid or alkaline conditions. Specific protease activity in 4th larval stages of both studied insects was more than other developmental stages. Protease activity in male and female pupa and adults of S. exigua was not significantly different, but in H. armigera male pupa and female adults have significantly more protease activity than other related sexes.

N2  - The effect of insect growth regulator (pyriproxyfen) on immature stages (eggs and nymphs) of Sunn pest, Eurygaster integriceps Puton (Heteroptera: Scutelleridae), which is of great importance in wheat and barley fields as nymphal and adult stages, was determined. When one day old eggs were treated with concentrations of 0.0, 0.1, 10, 100 and 1000 ppm, the egg hatchability were 96.90, 92.38, 98.4, 93.21 and 55.23 %, respectively. Similar results obtained when 3 day-old eggs were treated. However, when 5 day-old eggs were treated, no significant differences in egg hatchability between treatments observed (F = 1.51, P > 0.01). Adult weight was significantly influenced by treatment of nymphal instars. Treatments of first nymphal instars caused significant differences in adult weight between control and treatments (F = 25.63, P < 0.01). Adult weights were 102.5, 86.14, 69.47, 56.84, 62.11, and 64.56 mg when first instar nymphs were treated with concentrations of 0.0, 0.1, 10, 100 and 1000 ppm pyriproxyfen, respectively. Reduction of adult weight was significantly more when the nymphs were treated with high concentrations of pyriproxyfen. Nymphal developmental time was not significantly affected by pyriproxyfen treatment (P > 0.1). Adult emergence, sex ratio, nymphal survival rate and adults abnormalities were also affected by pyriproxyfen treatments of nymphs

N2  - In 2007 & 2008, a study of injurious and beneficial mites inhabiting green plantings was carried out in the urban environment of the north-eastern region of Iran, recording 24 species at different localities. Six species, Eotetranychus willametti, Oligonychus ilicis, Tetranychus truncatus, T. tumidellus, Aceria fraxiniflora, and Aculus dimidiatus are recorded from Iran for the first time. Also, 18 species are new for the fauna of north-eastern provinces of Iran. Most of the collected mites are phytophagous (19 species), dominated by Tetranychidae, with the presence of Tenuipalpidae and Eriophyidae of secondary importance. It was found that Oligonychus ununguis and Tetranychus turkestani are the most common and important pest species of conifers and broad leaf plants respectively. Species of 4 families belonging to 2 orders were found as predators. Among them, Phytoseius corniger and Amblyseius bagdasarjani were the most common predatory mite species in green plantings of the study areas.

N2  - The Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), which had been a quarantine pest to Iran until 1984, has become the most injurious pest of potatoes in Ardabil plain at northwest of the country, where more than 25000 ha of irrigated land is allocated to potato production and more than 20% of the annual potato production of the country is produced. Uncontrolled populations of the first generation of the Colorado potato beetle may completely defoliate potato plant and destroy the crop. Potato growers in Ardabil region almost always apply insecticides to control the pest, yet little information on the economic benefits of these control measures are available. This study was carried out in years 2004 and 2005 in Ardabil. At each of two study years experiments were conducted in three different locations in Ardabil plain. At each location a randomized complete block experiment with four replications and five treatments were used. Treatments were densities of zero, 5, 10, 15 and 20 late (3 rd and 4 th instars) larvae per plant of the first generation that were caged on a potato plant. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between different densities of the first generation larvae of the Colorado potato beetle and the yield of the potato cultivar ?Agria? and to establish economic injury level for the pest. A linear relationship was observed between the insect density and the marketable yield in 2004 and 2005 at all three locations. The overall linear regression of two study years for three locations accounted for 93.39% of variation among the treatments. Economic injury levels of the pest were calculated as 5 and 6.458 late larvae per plant for ?Agria? cultivar in years 2004 and 2005 respectively. Therefore, based upon the results obtained in this research the control measure for the Colorado potato beetle is not recommended at pest densities of lower than 5 late larvae per plant , because the chemical control at lower densities is not only economically unfeasible but also by producing deleterious effect on natural enemies causes damage to the environment.

N2  - The spatial distribution and population flactuation of two generations Ommatissus lybicus de Bergevin (Hom.: Tropiduchidae) were determined in the Bam region, Iran, in 2008. Spatial distribution pattern of O. lybicus was described at two generations using variance to mean ratios, Taylor?s power law coefficients and Iwao?s patchiness regression methods. The spatial distribution pattern of this pest was aggregated. At first generation, the collected data had better fit to Taylor?s model for nymphs, adults and both of them (r2=0.980, 0.839 and 0.968, respectively) in comparison with Iwao?s model (r2= 0.935, 0.836 and 0.787, respectively). Taylor?s model explained the distribution data at second generation for nymphs, adults and both of them (r2= 0.971, 0.966 and 0.843, respectively) better than Iwao?s model (r2= 0.910, 0.905 and 0.833, respectively). The  nymphs were active from April to May and August to October, at first and second generations  respectively. Adults of the first and second generations were active from May to June and September to November, respectively. By increasing temperature, O. lybicus had aestivation in the egg stage for 5 weeks. Spatial distribution coefficients can be used to develop a sampling program and to estimate the population dynamics of this pest accurately.

N2  - Due to limited available studies information about Reduviidae is rare in Iran and the world (Dispons & Villiers, 1967; Maldonado-Capriles, 1990; Modarres Awal, 1997). Reduviidae family is one of the most important bugs in the world, especially in biological control of pests. Some of these bugs are predator of pest insects such as aphids, psylls and thrips. A survey was conducted during 2007-2009 and the results showed that 20 species of 8 genera, Ectomocoris, Coranus, Reduvius, Oncocephalus, Rhynocoris, Holotrichius, Pirates and Nagusta were collected from studied areas and among them Coranus aegyptius (Fabricius, 1775), was the predominant species. Coranus subapterus (De Geer, 1773), Holotrichius mesoleucus (Kiritshenko, 1914) and Oncocephalus squalid (Rossi, 1790) have never been recorded in Iran. These species are marked with an asterisk. Lack of the information about these insects was the reason to identifing them in Mashhad, Iran. These species could be very promising agents for pest biocontrol

N2  - Field observations were undertaken at weekly interval (standard week), during 2007-08 at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi for studying the effect of three light sources in light traps (viz., mercury, black and ultra violet) on insect catch and their relationship with weather parameters. Results when analysed revealed that coleopterans dominate the catches, followed by hemipterans, hymenopterans and lepidopterans. The mercury light was more efficient for Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Odonata, and Diptera and while black light was more efficient for Coleoptera, Orthoptera, Isoptera, and Dictyoptera. Similar attractiveness to the mercury and black light sources were found for coleopterans. Coleopterans were equally attracted to mercury and black light sources. Average temperature showed significant relationship with coleopterans, lepidopterans and hemipterans when all insect traps were considered together

N2  - The toxicity of carbaryl, pirimicarb (pirimor) and commercial formulation of neem using leaf dip and larval-dip techniques against second and third instars of Pieris brassicae L. larvae was determined. Larval mortalities rates were significantly higher with carbaryl and pirimor compared to the neem in the larval-dip bioassays 24-h after treatment. In the leaf-dip bioassays, the highest concentrations of carbaryl and pirimor caused 80% to 100% mortalities of larvae. Neem exhibited a significant lethal and antifeedant effects on second and third instars larvae, although the effect was slow and varied among the different larval instars. Quick cessation of food consumption of larvae on treated leaves was observed. Consequently, there was a negligible damage on the insecticide treated leaves. Based on the data collected in the current study it could be speculated that carbaryl and pirimor may have unduly residue on treated plants, therefore; neem extract is merit to be considered as a suitable control agent against P. brassicae larvae

N2  - The effect of field recommended doses of imidacloprid, indoxacarb, and deltamethrin (290, 125, and 83 ppm based on active ingredient, respectively) were studied on some biological and demographic parameters of adult Habrobracon hebetor Say. The experiments were conducted at 26±1°C, 60±5% RH, and a photoperiod of 12 L:12 D h. Thirty, one-day-old females were treated using paper disc method for 24 h. Distilled water plus Triton X-100 was used in control treatment. Females survived in each treatment were transferred individually to 6 cm Petri dishes. One adult male was added to each Petri dish for mating. Three last instar larvae of Anagasta kuehniella (Zeller) were offered to each female daily as host. The number of eggs produced per female per day were counted until all of the females died. Stable population growth parameters were estimated using Carey's (1993) procedure. Gross and net reproductive rates in control and imidacloprid, indoxacarb, and deltamethrin treatment were 206.31±13.38 and 73.46±5.5; 186.82±21.39 and 46.81±6.52; 164.71±14.47 and 51.75±5.22; 102.39±9.84 and 19.95±2.56, respectively. Mean generation time and doubling time in control and insecticidal treatments were 21.22± 0.2 and 3.43±0.04; 22.49±0.32 and 4.07±0.13; 21.87±0.31 and 3.85±0.06; 22.41±0.36 and 5.21±0.2, respectively. Intrinsic rate of increase and finite rate of increase were estimated 0.2023±0.0025 and 1.2242±0.0031; 0.1706±0.0054 and 1.186±0.0064; 0.1802±0.0027 and 1.9746±0.0033; 0.1332±0.0052 and 1.1425±0.0059, respectively. Deltamethrin had the most adverse effect on stable population parameters of this wasp (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between indoxacarb and imidacloprid in this regard.

N2  - The Juvenile hormone analogue (JHA) methoprene (ZR-515) was employed for its effects on total hemocyte counts (THC) and pathological symptoms in Papilio demoleus L. The results show that the low dose (1µg/µL acetone) effects cause THC reduction in general and of PLs, ADs and SPs in Particular. The hitspathological symptoms  were observed as changes in PLs form. However, the high dose (100µg/µL acetone) produced imperfect and perfect supernumerary larval instars whose THC declined considerably. Extreme pathological symptoms in cell membrane, cytoplasm and  nucleus were observed. The possible  significance of these changes are discussed

N2  - This study examines the growth pattern and the ionic composition (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Po42-,Cl-) of the antennae of Zonocerus variegatus during its post embryonic development. The antennal length (cm) and number of antennal segments increased steadily during development with the adult stage having significantly (P<0.05) higher values than the lower instars. The growth gradient between the 6th instar and the adult stage was greater than that within the lower instars. Also, the growth rate of the body length (0.415x) was faster than the antennal length (0.215x). The 1st and 2nd instar stages of development had significantly higher ionic concentrations than the later instars and the adult stage. The relationship between these results and the behavior of the Z. variegatus is discussed

N2  - Sunn pest (Eurygaster integriceps Put.) (Hemiptera: Scutelleridae), is a serious pest of cereals causing severe quantitative and qualitative by feeding on leaves, stems and grains. Aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of photoperiod and diet on the Sunn pest diapause. Thus, the effect of two photoperiod conditions including short day (8 L: 16D) and long day (16L: 8D) and two diet including wheat grains and growing wheat plants on stadium duration, gonad size and haemolymph protein concentration was examined. Also, to extend our studies the effect of cold on gonad size and haemolymph protein concentration was studied. Results showed that stadium duration in short day photoperiod condition (31.43 days) was shorter than long day photoperiod condition (38.58 days) (P<0.05) i.e. when the nymphs were placed in short day conditions and fed on wheat grains their development time (time taken to adult) was shortened about 15?16 days in compare with those nymphs that placed in long day conditions and fed on wheat plants. Short day photoperiod condition and wheat grain diet caused larger ovary size (4.08±0.48 mm2) than long day conditions and wheat plant diet (3.12±0.04 mm2). Cold exposed females and males had lower haemolymph protein concentration than control females and males. The results showed that although photoperiod and diet cause significant changes on the stadium duration, ovaries and testis size and haemolymph electrophoretic bands, their distinct effects on diapause needs to be elaborated more

N2  - Among all biotic and abiotic constrains in Muga silkworm culture, disease is the most consistent and devastating one. Bacterial flacherie is such a silkworm disease that inflects more than 42% crop loss. Antibacterial drugs like streptomycin sulfate can be used successfully through leaf freshness technique useable in indoor rearing of Muga culture. Drug solution is mixed with leaf sap as absorbent by Som plant twigs that larvae feed on and, targeted disease causing bacteria in larval gut are exposed to streptomycin action. In vivo use of streptomycin sulfate resulted complete control of flacherie disease caused by Bacillus bacteria up to fourth instars. Being bacteria free in gut, larval feeding was more that was directly reflected in larval body weight and indirectly increases vurvivality of larvae. In this experiment with in vivo use of streptomycin sulfate 42% more survivality up to fifth instars of Muga larvae was achieved over 92% mortality in control rearing

Larval weight, larval duration and larval survival were studied in respect of indoor and outdoor rearing on Som-Soalu host plants. Hatched out larvae differ in weight according to seasons highest observed 0.007g per larva during Sept.-Oct. rearing season and lowest being 0.005g per larva during March-April and Nov.-Dec. The larval weight of different instars does not depend upon initial larval weight and size and weight of eggs, depend upon environmental temperature. Larval weight, larval duration and larval survival were found different from each other in Som and Soalu leafs from their indoor and outdoor counterparts. Indoor rearing on detached twigs in wooden tray does not vary mark ably from outdoor rearing on trees. Climatic conditions are the most important factors to be considered in Muga silkworm cultivation regardless of indoor or outdoor rearing

N2  - Mulberry silkworm, Bombyx mori is the most commercially exploited insect which is domesticated worldwide for the production of silk cocoons. Domestication and constant rearing for the past several thousands of years made the silkworm highly susceptible to different pathogens. Different micro-organisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and microsporidia cause infectious diseases in silkworm. White muscardine caused by the fungal pathogen Beauveria bassiana is one of the most common and devastating diseases of silkworm. All the life stages of silkworm are susceptible to B. bassiana and its infection to silkworm during ecdysis (moulting) is studied and discussed in the present paper. The silkworms were inoculated with the pathogen at 1 × 105 conidia/ml dose at different durations (18, 12 and 6 hours) before and after moult. Inoculation was also done during the moult.  Mortality was 100% when the inoculation was done 12 hours before and 6 hours after moulting. Mortality was significantly less when the larvae were inoculated during moulting or 6 hours before moult. The present findings indicate the inability of B. bassiana to invade the silkworm during its moulting period. Skin casting and related processes during ecdysis may be preventing the fungus to enter inside the haemocoel of silkworm to cause infection and mortality

N2  - Sesamia botanephaga Tams & Bowden, 1953 was reported in Iran, for the first time, from sugarcane fields of Khuzestan province, SW Iran. The accuracy of this report was dubitable, because S. botanephaga is a native species to Africa. In this investigation, samples were taken from agricultural fields of Khuzestan and Fars provinces in 2007. Taxonomic study revealed that all samples were Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefèbvre, 1827); thus African S. botanephaga (or S. nonagrioides botanephaga) does not occur in Iran

N2  - The leafminer, Chromatomyia horticola (Goureau) (Diptera: Agromyzidae), is one of the most important pest of canola, Brassica napus L., crop in Ardabil region. In this research, the parasitoid species of the leafminer larvae were collected and identified in the experimental field of canola in the University of Mohaghegh Ardabili during 2008 and 2009. Then the percentage of abundance of each of parasitoid species was determined in the experimental field. In 2008 and 2009, Diglyphus isaea (Walker) had the highest abundance (48.3% and 42.8%, respectively) and Chrysocharis Pubichornis (Zetterstedt), Dacnusa sibirica Telenga and Pediobius sp. had lower abundance, respectively. Also, the density of larvae and the percentage of parasitized larvae were determined on nineteen canola cultivars in the experimental field. The density of larvae was lower on Opera, Hyola401 and RGS003 than on the other tested cultivars during 2008 and 2009. The percentage of parasitized larvae on Opera, hyola401 and RGS003 was significantly higher than on the other tested cultivars. Therefore, it could be concluded that using of Opera, Hyola401 and RGS003 cultivars might be increased the efficiency of parasitoids in control of the larvae of C. horticola

N2  - Plant secondary metabolites play an important role in the plant-insect interactions. Some compounds extracted from plants have insecticidal activity against insects. The chemical composition of the essential oil from seeds of Carum copticum grown in mashhad, Iran, was studied by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Thymol (43%), ã-terpinen (15.85%) and â-cymene (21.67%) were found to be the major constituents of the oil. Fumigant toxicity test of above-mentioned plant essential oil against adults of Tribolium confusum du Val, Rhyzopertha dominica F. and Oryzaephilus surinamensis L. were carried out at 27±2°C and 60±5% RH. Results demonstrated that O. surinamensis (LC50 = 1.69 ìl/l air) was significantly more susceptible than R. dominica (LC50 = 19.01 ìl/l air) and T. confusum (LC50 = 58.70 ìl/l air) at 24 h length of exposure to this essential oil. In all cases, considerable differences were observed in mortality of insects with essential oil vapor in different concentrations and times. As expected, mortality was increased by increasing of doses and exposure time after 72 h fumigation

N2  - Cereal aphids are one of the most important insect pests limiting cereal production worldwide. Classical morphological criteria for aphid species identification may be affected by environmental factors such as climatic conditions and physiological status of the host plant. So, two modern molecular techniques; Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSRs) were used to find diagnostic markers for fingerprinting eleven cereal aphids those collected from different cereal plants and from different localities in Egypt. Eight RAPD and five ISSRs primers were successively proven 97 and 69 markers that could be used to differentiate the eleven different cereal aphid species. Also these molecular techniques with 26 diagnostic morphological characters were used to find the Phylogenetic relationship among the different collected species; that divided into two clusters with similarity matrix percentages of 73% and 82%. From these results it could concluded that these techniques could be used successively to fingerprint and identify these aphid species and differentiate among them

His main (at least in my evaluation) implicit thesis (that biological facts should be interpreted according to philosophical theorems) led him to several explicit conclusions, the two most important from the practicising taxonomist?s point of view being: 1) that diachronic classifications are ambiguous, incompatible with either Linnean hierachy or Darwinian evolutionary postulates, and therefore only synchronic systems are sound; and 2) that binominal nomenclature is illogical and unnecessary, therefore genus names should be abandoned or fixed as parts of uninomina. As in my opinion these ideas should not be left uncommented, I wish to present some critical remarks here

N2  - Techniques based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been shown as powerful tools for ecological studies of predator-prey interactions. Species-specific primers, which are designed to amplify target prey DNA from the gut contents of generalist predators, can potentially be used to develop highly specific and sensitive assays. We developed species-specific primers from the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene for six insect pests of Brassica crops (Plutella xylostella, Pieris rapae, Hellula hydralis, Helicoverpa punctigera, Brevicoryne brassicae, and Myzus persicae). Specificity tests confirmed each primer pairs specifically amplifies prey DNA without cross-reactivity to predators or other non-target species, which are commonly found in the same habitats. These molecular markers also allow amplification of a very small amount of target DNA in the presence of substantially greater amounts of predator DNA. Although multiplexing of primers could potentially be used to detect the presence of multiple prey species in a single assay, the sensitivity of it compare with singleplex PCR was lower. Here we show that these primers are specific and sensitive and can be applied in ecological studies of predator-prey interactions in the field

N2  - Confused flour beetle, Tribolium confusum du Val (Col.: Tenebrionidae) is one of the most important stored product pests of flour in Iran. In this research the effects of insect growth regulators (IGRs): teflubenzuron, hexaflumuron and pyriproxyfen on oviposition rate, emergence of adults, repellency effects of 17 days-larvae and adults of confused flour beetle have been studied. The results showed that, the highest and lowest of inhibitory reproduction were observed in teflubenzuron (88.5%) and pyriproxyfen (77.4%), respectively. All IGRs significantly were reduced the oviposition rate of T. confusum.The maximum and minimum of inhibitory emergences of adults were observed in Teflubenzuron (86.26%) and pyriproxyfen (75.73%), respectively. Results showed that, reproduction and adult emergences inhibitories were directly correlated with the IGRs concentrations. Repellency effects of IGRs on adults indicated that, the highest and lowest were recorded for teflubenzuron (48.12%) and pyriproxyfen (39.37%). This effect?s experiment on 17-days old larvae showed that, maximum and minimum repellency were in teflubenzuron (47.5%) and pyriproxyfen (36.87%), respectively. These results suggested that IGRs could be used as safe insecticides to control of confused flour beetle

N2  - A new species, Pomegranate (Punica granatum) is one of the most important crops in Iran. Markazi province has a lot of wide Pomegranate?s orchards. However, there are some pests that can damage these crops. Carob moth, Ectomyelois ceratoniae Zell. (Lep.: Pyralidae) is the most important pest, especially in Iran. The damage by this pest can at times reach up to 80%. To control it, three methods are used in Saveh region: a) Releasing the eggs of T. embryophagum for biological control of this pest.b) Cutting off stamens of pomegranate. c) Using the two methods together.The purpose of this research was to compare the efficiency of these three methods .To achieve this objective, a one-hectare-orchard was chosen for each treatment. The containing treatments: Releasing T. embryophagum, cutting off stamens of pomegranate, using the two methods together and control. Cutting off the stamens of pomegranate was done two times and the release of T. embryophagum was done10 times and once in every 10 days. Cutting off the stamens of pomegranate was done two times. 400 pomegranates were randomly picked out of each treatment (four repetitions of 100) and were kept for 2 months in the warehouse. The results of research showed that there was a significant difference between the treatments. Reduction of injury was observed in all of the treatments in comparison to the control. Infection amounts were 30% in control, 10.5% in releasing of T. embryophagum, 5.4% in cutting off the stamens of pomegranate and 4.5% in using the two methods together. There was no significant difference between cutting off the stamens of pomegranate and using the two methods together in the warehouse

N2  - In recent years, the use of the insect-proof screens in protection of greenhouse crops has been increasingly recognized. In this study, the effectiveness of three types of insect-proof screens for their exclusion of Frankliniella occidentalis, Chaetosiphon  fragaefolii and Tetranychus urticae have been evaluated in laboratory conditions (L:D 16:8, 27?b2 ¢XC Temp., and 60?b10% R.H.). The tested insect-proof screens were the 5¡Ñ5 (5¡Ñ5 threads per cm2), 13¡Ñ23, 30¡Ñ34 and Agryl p-17. In each cylindrical container, which was sealed by every one of the above mentioned insect-proof screens at one end, 50 individuals were placed. In this experiment, flowers and leaves of strawberry were used as an incentive for the insect to move through the openings of insect-proof screens. The control percent of screens was evaluated by calculating the number of insects in which were existed in the containers after 24 hours. The results of this experiment indicated that the 5¡Ñ5 insect screen, which is widely used in greenhouses, did not exclude these pests really. Results also indicated that 94% of C. fragaefolii controlled by the 13¡Ñ23 screen, compared to not efficient of this screen in excluding of F. occidentalis and T. urticae. 100% of C. fragaefolii, 46.66% of F. occidentalis and 13.8% of T. urticae controlled by the 30¡Ñ34 screen. However, control percent was higher for C. fragaefolii than for F. occidentalis and T. urticae and this was related to the larger size of the strawberry aphid as compared to the western flower thrips and twospotted spider mite

N2  - Present study was aimed to investigate fumigant toxicity of essential oils extracted from Lippia citrodora Kunth., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Mentha piperita L. and Juniperus Sabina L. against adults of cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus (Col.: Bruchidae). Essential oils were extracted from aerial parts of plants via hydrodistillation. Adults (1-7 days old) of insects were exposed to a series of concentrations of essential oils for 24 h and then the numbers of dead and alive insects were counted. Results showed that essential oil of M. piperita (LC50 7.86 µl/L air) was significantly more toxic than L. citrodora (LC50 187.51 µl/L air), J. Sabina (LC50 134.35 µl/L air) and R. officinalis (LC50 46.81 µl/L air). Results of this investigation suggested that essential oils of these plants could be used as safe fumigants for controlling of C. maculatus in small scales

N2  - In this study the effect of three insecticides including Trichlorophen, chlorpyriphos-methyl and Oxydemton-methyl on Brevicoryne brassicae in a leaf dip assay was investigated. At the highest and the lowest concentrations of Oxydemton-methyl 91.16 and 25 % mortality was achieved, respectively. Fifty percent mortality (LC50) was recorded at 19.62 ppm with fudicial limit of 11.41 and 30.73 ppm. Also, LC10 and LC90 were estimated to be 1.08 and 356.27 ppm. When different concentrations of Trichlorophen was used at the lowest and the highest concentrations about 21.27 and 87.23 % mortality was achieved, respectively which correspond to 30 and 480 ppm of the insecticide doses. Lethal concentration of 10, 50 and 90% was calculated using probit analysis and estimated LC10, LC50 and LC90 were 14.30, 95.96 and 643.89 ppms, respectively. Estimated lethal concentration of 10, 50 and 90 for chlorpyriphos-methyl were equal to 14.06, 59.65 and 253.10 ppm, respectively. Results showed that the most effective insecticide was Oxydemton-methyl with the LC50 value of 19.62 ppm followed by chlorpyriphos methyl with the LC50 value of 59.65 ppm and Trichlorophen with the LC50 value of 95.96 ppm. Therefore, Oxydemton-methyl act on insect through contact and systemic action that is major reason why this insecticide has low LC50 and is more effective than the other two insecticides which are contact and stomach insecticides

N2  - Ninety second instars were used to investigate the growth response of Zonocerus variegatus (L) (Orthoptera: Pyrgomorphidae) nymphs at three feeding periods namely 7.00am-7.00pm, 7.00pm -7.00am and 7.00am-7.00am.  Nine cages were constructed and divided into groups of three tagged A, B and C; representing each of the three feeding periods studied.  Three replicates per treatment with 10 nymphs per replicate were produced in a completely randomized design. The nymphs were fed with leaves of cassava (Manihot esculenta Cranz). In all the five bodily parameters measured, Z. variegatus nymphs fed better during 7.00am-7.00am period (P< 0.05) than other feeding periods; and this was followed by nymphs that were fed during 7.00am -7.00pm. Consequently, Z. variegatus nymphs recorded higher growth rates in three morphometric and one gravimetric parameter namely mean body length, mean antennal length, mean femur length, and mean body weight during 7.00am-7.00am period. Even, in the mean internotal lenght where significant difference was not shown (P>0.05), higher mean value was still shown by nymphs that were fed during 7.00am-7.00am period.  This study has implicated among other factors the role of the length of time of food availability as important in growth response of Z. variegatus nymphs

N2  - The present study was carried out to determine population fluctuations of the pest Lepidosaphes pistaciae (Archangelskaya) (Homoptera: Diaspididae) at two different pistachio orchards in 2003 and 2004 in Siirt province. The high population level of L. pistaciae was determined on pistachio leaves as compared to pistachio shoots and fruits. Populations on the shoots were found to be mature female and they were found to usually pass through winter on 2-3 year-old shoots. L. pistaciae eggs began to hatch in May and made the transition on pistachio leaves and it was determined that they reached the maximum level during the middle and towards the end of July. It was observed that the populations formed on fruits were removed with harvest and that the next year?s population was formed of the leaf populations. The pest gave one offspring in the province of Siirt. According to the results of this study, it was determined that the pest reached high population levels from time to time at both orchards on which population monitoring was made and it was concluded that while determining for struggle against pests, especially the leaf population should be taken into consideration

N2  - The essential oils are considered powerful source of natural derivatives useful against stored product pests; they are as new control strategies. In this research it was investigated fumigant toxicity of six essential oils from Melissa officinalis L., Mentha piperata L., Petroselinum sativum Hoffmann, Lavandula angustifolia Mill., Ziziphora clinopodioides Lam., and Artemisia dracunculus L., on first instar larvae and eggs, ovipositional deterrency of Plodia interpunctella Hübner. LC50 values were determined. Ovicidal activity was assessed in Petri dishes on one-day old eggs that exposures three concentrations as 3, 12 and 24 micro liter essential oil per liter air. For studying effect of essential oils on oviposition deterrence one pair of new emergence adult were exposured by 2 µl essential oil. LC50s were between 5 to 10 µl/l and Z. clinopodioides had most ovicidal activity. Increasing concentrations increased activity of essential oils. The least oviposited eggs have been observed in L. angustifolia, M. piperata and Z. clinopodioides. These results showed that L. angustifolia, and Z. clinopodioides had more ovicide and egg deterrence effect for this pest. The essential oils investigated in this study are used as pharmaceuticals and in flavoring. They are considered because they are less harmful to humans than most synthetic insecticides

Popular elite bivoltine pure silkworm races like CSR2, CSR4, CSR6, CSR26, CSR27 and traditional bivoltine pure race NB4D2 were reared. Performances of the different races were analyzed and studied the seasonal effects. All the races showed better productivity and quality in rainy and winter season when compared to summer season. The results indicated that rearing performance and seed production parameters were comparatively better for CSR2, CSR6, CSR26 and CSR27 during rainy season. The traditional bivoltine dumb-bell race NB4D2 and elite bivoltine dumb-bell race CSR4 performed well during winter season for rearing as well as seed production parameters.  During summer most of the rearing and seed parameters of NB4D2 recorded higher when compared to all other races and the rearing parameters like yield /100 dfls (76.61kg), pupation rate (94.29%) and recovery percentage of Dfls  (32.75%) recorded comparatively higher than other races. The results of the study conclude that the races NB4D2 and CSR2 have performed well in all the seasons for most of the parameters studied and indicated the stabilized expression for the racial characters

N2  - Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae) were isolated from cultivated lands in Karur region of Tamil Nadu, India. The ITS (internal transcribed spacer) rDNA sequence similarity of isolated EPNs revealed that the nematode strains Steinernema siamkayai, S. pakistanense and Heterorhabditis indica were more prevalent in cultivated eco-systems of that region. PCR-RFLP patterns obtained from 10 different restriction enzymes have shown that these strains were phylogenetically are more or less closely related within species, but they are genetically diverse from location to location in that region. Among 25 nematode strains, 19 strains were phylogenetically related to S. siamkayai (strain CM2) isolated from Belgium. Three strains of Steinernema sp. were related to S. pakistanense strain isolated from USA and remaining three Heterorhabdus sp. similar to H. indica strain cohen 21 from USA. Thus, intra-specific relationships among strains of these nematodes would emphasis that geographic distribution and environmental conditions may be associated to bring such genetic variations and divergence in the genomes of the nematodes

N2  - During the recent decade, the high risks and detrimental consequences associated with the use of chemical and even microbial pesticides have been a recurring theme in pest control, and researchers have been trying to pursue low-risk and environmentally sound tactics. However, biological control is a non-chemical method that utilizes natural enemies for suppression and regulation of insect pest populations. This study was performed in order to assess parasitism rate and parasitoid diversity of Cabbage Large White Butterfly, Pieris brassicae (L.) (Lep.: Pieridae), on cabbage fields in comparison with wild hosts in Urmia. Also In this study some biological and behavioral characteristics of Pteromalus puparum (L.) (Hym.: Pteromalidae(, predominant endoparasitoid wasp of  P. brassicae, was studied. For this purpose, samples were taken from various cabbage farms and wild hosts of this pest outside the farm. The specimens have been collected from all stages of P. brassicae. In order to parasitoids emerge, samples incubated separately in laboratory conditions at 23 ± 1°C, 40 ± 5 % r.h. and 16:8 h (L:D) photoperiod. The other main purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of P. puparum in the biological control of Cabbage Large White Butterfly

N2  - Due to economical importance of stored-products insects and resistance to conventional insecticides, it is necessary to use novel and suitable compounds in control programs. Therefore, we evaluated the toxicity of spinosad to three important storage insects viz, Red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), Rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.), and Sawtoothed grain beetle Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.). One-day old adult insects were exposed to different concentrations of spinosad. The exposure times were 24, 48 and 72 hours in all experiments. Experiments were performed in complete randomized block design with 4 replications. After treatment the samples were held under constant conditions in rearing room at 27±2ºC, 65±5 R.H and 14 D: 10 L photoperiod. In contact tests for T. castaneum the maximum mortality rate was achieved with 500 ppm of spinosad after 72 h exposure. Application of 400 ppm of spinosad after 72 h caused maximum mortality in S. oryzae. For contact treatment the complete control of O. surinamensis was obtained with 500 ppm spinosad at 72 h exposure time. It is possible to recommend 500 ppm of spinosad for complete control of the tested insects through contact application. Estimated LC50 values of spinosad in 72 h after exposure for adults of T. Castaneum, S. oryzae and O. surinamensis were 1287, 279 and 53.17 ppm, respectively. Results showed that O. surinamensis is most susceptible insect to spinosad in these experiments

Although the bees are susceptible to diseases and attacked by natural enemies like wasps, ants and wax moth, constant vigilance on the part of the bee keepers can overcome these adverse conditions. The present plunge in population (< 0.01) was not due to these reasons. It was caused by man due to unscientific proliferation of towers and mobile phones

N2  - Prey preference and switching behavior of Orius niger on three preys, Thrips tabaci, Aphis gosssypii and Tetranychus urticae were examined. Ephestia kuehniella Zeller eggs, corn pollen and green bean pods were used as food and oviposition sites, respectively. Experiment was carried out under laboratory condition (25±1°C and 65±5% RH, with a 16:8 L: D photoperiod). Four to six days old females of the predatory bug was used in experiment. We monitored  the prey of the preference of the predatory bug on cucumber leaf disks containing: 10 second instar larvae of Thrips tabaci, 10 second or third instar nymphs of Aphis gossypii and 10 adults of Tetranychus urticae for 12 h. in 6 replicates.  Number of prey consumed was recorded, the preference indexes of T. tabaci, A. gossypii and T urticae were 0.54, 0.35 and 0.089, respectively. For each experiment, a piece of host plant, determined densities (10-40, 25-25, 40-10) of Aphis gossypii and T. tabaci and one predator were placed in a cage. Each experiment lasted 12h and was repeated six times. Switching behavior of predatory bug was examined. The results of host preference showed that there was no significant difference between the mean number stages of T. tabaci and A. gossypii consumed (p>0.05) and there was significant difference between the mean number of consumed T. tabaci and A. gossypii with T. urticae (p<0.05). In Switching behavior, number of prey consumed was recorded: In the first, with increasing of relative prey density, preference rate was decreased (negative preference), near equal density, decreasing of relative prey density, preference rate was increased (positive preference)

N2  - Applying essential oils fumigant toxicity in stored products pests control has sharpened recently. Since these products have low penetration power and vapor pressure, their use in crop depth is restricted. The aim of this work was using controlled release technology to solve this problem. In this research, 1,8-Cineole based pellets were prepared by Dry Mixing Method and physical load of 1,8-Cineole on PVA, which followed by pressing the mixture, using pellet maker apparatus, to form pellets. Insecticidal efficacy of produced pellets was investigated against adults (1-3 days old) of Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), callosobruchus maculatus (F.) and Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) under 28±2ºC and darkness in laboratory condition. LC50 of 1 gram pellets against T. castaneum in 24 h and 48 h was 1.6 and 0.91 ml active ingredient per L air, respectively. LC50 ¬value for R. dominica and C. maculatus in 12 h was 0.7and 1.48 ml a.i./L air, respectively. Physical load of essential oils and their constituents could be performed on biodegradable polymers and their application in stores will be possible by this manner

N2  - To determine the impact of citowett oil and commercial neem extract mixture against the Pieris brassica these experiments were under taken. Citowett as a wetting agent was used in conjunction with neem extract against the larval stage of the pest in question. The LC50 values of neem extract and combination with citowett oil for second and third instars larvae were estimated, 4.40, 3.89 and 3.38, 2.16 ppm, respectively. The combination of neem extract with citowett increased the larval mortality rate up to 15%. This implies that the application of the mixture is a sound measure for enhancing lethality impacts.  Based on collected data it could be concluded that combination of these two less hazardous chemicals is merit to be considered as a candidate control agent against Pieris brassica

N2  - During the survey of oak fed silkmoth fauna in the forest of North-Eastern part of India, the Indian oak fed silkmoth, Antheraea roylei Moore was recorded from oak growing areas of this region and it constitutes a part of the wild silk moth genetic resources of this region. It is distributed in the Indian Sub-Himalayan range and South East Asian countries. It feeds on about 12 varieties of oak tasar food plants.  The bionomics and potential of the silkmoth was studied in the laboratory condition and the results are presented in this paper.   A. roylei behaves as bivoltine in nature. The female moth lays 185-230 eggs. The average hatching percent, larval period, cocoon yield, effective rate of rearing (ERR %), cocoon weight, cocoon shell weight,  cocoon shell ratio % and average single filament length in the laboratory condition were 61.40 %, 38 days, 30 cocoons/disease free laying (dfl), 20.36 %, 7.94 g, 0.85 g, 10.71 % and 250 m respectively. A. roylei shows high genetic compatibility with A. pernyi and A. proylei in interspecific hybridization which shows the genetic potential of this species.  The F1 hybrids of A. roylei with A. pernyi and A. proylei showed high vigour in all the yield contributing characters. The present study will be very helpful for future breeding programs in oak tasar culture

N2  - A polyvoltine silkworm breed ?AGL3? was evolved by using dispermic  androgenesis. The breed was developed by crossing F2 males derived from a polyvoltine hybrid BL68 × BL69 with another polyvoltine race ?Nistari? and exposing the eggs at 38 ºC for 200 minutes. Androgenetic larvae expressed paternal characters. Repeated backcrosses were adopted with androgenetic males for several generations. The line was evaluated utilizing five productive bivoltine silkworm breeds. Laboratory evaluation showed superiority of the hybrid AGL3 × CSR2 in terms of higher fecundity, pupation rate, yield/10,000 larvae by weight, cocoon shell weight, cocoon shell percentage, filament length and neatness. The hybrid exhibited maximum average evaluation index value and manifested high hybrid vigour for several characters. The possibility of application of androgenesis as a breeding tool in silkworm breeding for the evolution of superior silkworm breeds and hybrids has been discussed

This mealybug can be distinguished by its even segmented antennae, distribution of setae similar to cerariian setae on dorsal surface of the body and number of cerarii discernible with difficulty. The need to differentiate this from other important mealybugs occurring in cotton agroecosystems has been taken care of through making its diagnostics as simple as possible. The examination of populations from different regions, simplifying its diagnostics through illustration of taxonomic characters significant at all taxonomic levels and explaining their terminology has also been achieved

It revealed significant variation between altered and controlled experiments. D. melanogaster larvae prefer to pupate less on glass and more in media when temperature and density altered than control. D. simulans larvae prefers glass lesser than control at 30ºC and higher than control at 200 and 250 larvae/vial at 15, 20 and 25ºC, whereas the media pupation is contrasts to the glass pupation in D. simulans. The media pupation is more at 30ºC and less at other temperature at all type of density compared to control. D. melanogaster larvae does not prefer to pupate on cotton at 30ºC, the larvae of D. simulans does not prefer o pupate on cotton at all density and temperatures. Two-way ANOVA revealed that variation of PSP in both the species at varied temperature and density at different sites was found to be significant

N2  - The contents of metathoracic glands of two sexes and different ages of adult Graphosoma lineatum (L.) were analyzed at laboratory conditions. Insect rearing were carried out on the seeds of three species of umbelliferous plants (Parsley, Petroselinum crispum; Carrot, Daucus carota; and coriander, Coriandrum sativum). The scent gland compounds of 3- 15- and 25-days old adults were extracted by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In this study, SPME and direct injection were applied to evaluate commercial and common fiber. The results showed that SPME method and common pencil fiber were effective in detection of scent gland extracts. Different components such as tridecane, 3-methyl pentanol, cis-1,2- dimethyl cyclopentane, hexane, heptane, (E)-2-hexenal, ethyl cyclohexane, limonene, (Z)-4-hexen-1-ol acetate, undecane, dodecane, (E)-2-decenal, 1-tridecene, tetradecane, (E)-5-decenyl acetate, pentadecane and hexadecane were detected in scent glands which tridecane and 3-methyl pentanol were the major components. Comparison of chromatographic peak area obtained in the same experimental conditions revealed that the abundance of some compounds varied considerably by the sex and age of insects

N2  - Population size structure of Hepsetus odoe was investigated during the rising and falling water levels in Oba Reservoir, Ogbomoso, Nigeria. The species was common in grassy, middle and open water microhabitats. The studied fish exhibited a wider size distribution in terms of space and time; the size of adults H. odoe changed from rising water means of 220.7 mm (S.D=28.2) to a falling water means of 216.9 mm S.D=51.6, t(long-transformed S.L)=30.32, D.F=132, P<0.0001. Also, all variables pertaining to males and females in microhabitats were significantly different (p<0.05). The sex ratios for inshore and offshore catches deviate from the same pattern as the deviation was significant in inshore and insignificant in offshore. Majority of the sampled fish inhabited inshore (56.4%), 46.62% occupied middle part and the total mean catch in micro habitats (grassy, middle and open waters) was less than 500 kg. The total mean catch for gillnets selectivity based on mesh sizes was less than 600 kg. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) increases with increased in fish size which correlates with increased net mesh size

N2  - Cockroaches are one of the ubiquitous insects around human residential areas and their filthy habits make them to be potential carriers of pathogens. In this study, we document the potential health risks associated with cockroaches as mechanical vectors of medically important gastro-intestinal parasites in Osogbo, Southwestern Nigeria. The body surface and the faecal samples of the cockroaches collected from residential area and hospital vicinity were screened for the parasites between November 2011 and February 2012. Thirteen (23.63%) of the 55 cockroaches collected in residential area harboured gastro-intestinal parasites while 16 (35.55%) of the 45 cockroaches from hospital vicinity harboured parasites. Cysts / ova of six gastro-intestinal parasites namely cyst of Entamoeba hystolitica, cysts of Balantidium coli, ova of Ascaris lumbricoides, cyst of E. coli, ova of Enterobius vermicularis and ova of hookworm were encountered in the body surface and faecal samples of the cockroaches during this study. The cockroaches from hospital vicinity harboured more parasites (five out of six) than residential areas (four out of six) but the difference in parasite burden was not statistically significant (p>0.05). The promotion of hygienic conditions and periodical fumigation of the environment become imperative so as to control the population of cockroaches and reduce the health risks associated with their presence in the study area

N2  - Insects generally respond to varieties of cues but little is known on the attraction of Simulium damnosum sensu lato to plants. The present study investigates the attraction of Simulium damnosum s.l. to Pterocarpus santalinoides along Osun River in South Western Nigeria. Two consented fly capturers were positioned under Pterocarpus santalinoides and a plant of comparable size at Osun Budepo and Osun Eleja both located along Osun river between October to December, 2008. The number of the flies caught under P. santalinoides was statistically higher than the control at both sites with P. santalinoides accounting for 63.86% and 59.39% of the flies collected at Osun Budepo and Osun Eleja respectively (Osun Budepo, F= 218.4, P<0.05; Osun Eleja, F= 147.2, P>0.05). The results therefore demonstrate that the identification of the compounds possibly responsible for the attraction could be used to develop lures for the trapping and control of S. damnosum

In this regard, 18 different wetlands with important potential of Hirudo medicinalis is examined. Of all, Kızılırmak Delta and Yeşilırmak Delta are the lands where virtually all medicinal leeches exported from Turkey are gathered. The examined wetlands were scanned for habitats that can involve medicinal leech and especially shallow wetlands with intense surface and underwater macrophyte vegetation are preferred. The amounts of Hirudo medicinalis caught in certain periods in these wetlands were analyzed and compared in terms of density

N2  - The aphid Rhopalosiphum padi is an important pest of cereal crops worldwide. Because of having both sexual and asexual populations, it has been the target of extensive ecological and genetic studies. In this paper we report on genetic variation of R. padi in Iran based on microsatellite markers. Genetic diversity of thirty five R. padi clones, collected from various cultivated and wild host plants in different regions in Iran, was studied using eight microsatellite markers. Out of eight markers, five showed 16 polymorphic bands, varying from 2 to 5, with an average of 3.2. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Iranian aphid clones collected from northern, north-eastern, northwestern, southern, south-western and central region of Iran were clustered into four distinct groups. A significant correlation was observed between aphid clones and geographical regions. According to our results, geographic populations differed significantly and their genetic distance could be mainly explained by geographic separation. Apparently geographic barriers hinder gene flow and genetic variation among Iranian R. padi clones

N2  - The fall web worm, Hyphantria cunea Drury (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) native insect to North America has recently been introduced into Iran resulting in severe damage to trees and agricultural production. An experiment was conducted to examine insecticidal effect of a commercial product of neem extract, Achook® (Godrej india) containing 0.03% of effective material,Azadirachtin, against third instar larva of this pest. The first instar larvae were collected from Platanus orientalis hosts and reared on fresh mulberry leaves in growth chambers (28± 2 ºC, RH 75± 5 and 14:10 LD). Third instar larvae of next generation were used in the present study. The dipping method was used where mulberry leaves of similar sizes were dipped in the solution of neem and provided to the larvae.  About 70 percent mortality was observed in treated insects after 48 h. The controls fed 51.93 more than treated larvae. The measurement of physiological factors ( cholestrol, uric acid, urea urea, protein, glucose) showed reduction in treated larvae in comparison to control insects. The possible significance of these changes is discussed

N2  - The present research aimed to study the oviposition site preference of the predatory bug Deraeocoris lutescens Schilling (Hemiptera: Miridae) at 25±1°C temperature, relative humidity of 60±10% and a photoperiod of 16:8 h (L:D). The experiments on different plant species were investigated among four groups of plants, six crop plant species, three greenhouse plant species, five orchard plant species and five ornamental plant species. Among different plant species, most oviposition was on broad bean leaves with a total of 41.7±3.7, sweet pepper with 31.1±3.4, grape leave with 13.9±2.8 and begonia with 39.3±3.0 eggs in each group. In order to determine preference of D. lutescens for oviposition, broad bean leaves which infested with different nutritional sources, Aphis gossypii, Aphis fabae, Myzus persicae, eggs of Sitotroga cerealella, 10% honey emulsion and 10% honey emulsion + yeast extract were used. Among these leaves as substrates of oviposition, the adult females showed higher preference for leaves infested with M. persicae than with other nutritional sources. The preferred site for egg deposition at light and dark area by D. lutescens females was tested. The adult females showed significantly higher preference for the leaves as substrates of oviposition in the dark area than in the light area

Colonization, colony development and pest infestation were monitored over a period of 16 weeks. Hive type did not significantly (P>0.05) affect colonization period. All hive types were colonized with 100% colonization in TFW and KF. KW and KFW had 66.67% colonization. The least mean colonization period was 3.67 days after hive installation and was observed in KF, while the longest colonization period of 7 days was observed in KFW. Hive type did not affect weight gain ranged from 0.3 kg (TFW at 2 weeks after colonization) to 2.5 kg (KF at 8 weeks after colonization). Bee population was significantly affected by hive type and was lowest in TFW which was the only hive type that was heavily (2/3 of the replicates) infested by Galleria mellonella, hence the reason for its lowest weight and bee population. Aethina tumida was encountered in KT and KF. Both pests were observed in colonized hives. The only intruder that was observed in uncolonized hive was Gryllus bimaculatus and was encountered in KFW. With 100% colonization and least mean colonization period of 3.67 days post installation of baited hives in Kenya top bar with flight entrance on the floor (KF), KF is recommended for areas where the risk of accidental rain water into hive is not paramount

N2  - Composition and structure of Heteroptera communities (Insecta: Hemiptera) in high altitude habitats of a national protected area in Argentina. One of the basic strategies to protect biodiversity is the establishment of National Parks and other protected areas. Los Cardones National Park (Salta, Argentina) is of great importance because it attempts to preserve a representative sample of Andean biomes above 2700masl, such as Monte Occidental , the Puna-Prepuna and  upper reaches of  the Yungas. We describe the composition and structure of  an inventory of true bugs sampled over a 1-year period in the three ecoregions represented in this protected area. Twenty-nine species of Heteroptera were recorded, including five new records for the Province of Salta. All species are first records to the park. The inventory obtained represents 85.29% of the total estimated by non-parametric estimator (Chao1), with Miridae as the best represented family. The results contribute to knowledge of the Heteroptera of the protected area and provide a basis for comparisons with other studies conducted in other high altitude habitats

N2  - The objective of this work is to study the biology of Asian Citrus psyllids, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama on Citrus sinensis in Jammu and Kashmir, India having varied agro-climatic conditions ranging from tropical, sub-tropical to temperate conditions. C. sinensis (Sweet Orange) is a cherished and economically important fruit in Jammu region of J & K State which is severely attacked by Asian citrus psyllids, a very serious pest of citrus in India. Both adults and nymphs suck sap of citrus plants, reduce their vigour and kill tender shoots. Citrus psylla has also been established as a vector of the ?greening disease?. Thus, an attempt was made to study the biology of D. citri in Jammu. The insects were reared in the laboratory at room temperature (10.84°C-32.87°C) and relative humidity of 26%-80% on C. sinensis plantlets. Eggs were laid in clusters on the half opened tender leaves and tender twigs. There are five nymphal stages with length varying from 0.26-2.96 mm. The incubation, nymphal and adult longevity were 2.28±0.18, 14.86+1.07 and 10±1.23 days respectively. Thus, the psyllid has a total life span of 20 to 36.5 days (27.14+2.34 days). The present study is an important step in future to record the no. of generations of Asian Citrus psyllids on C. sinensis and for the timely management of the pest

N2  - Jammu and Kashmir is the only state in India which enjoys the salubrious climate for bivoltine silk production and is the fourth major state in India. Lot of efforts are being pumped in to introduce a second crop in the state to explore the hidden potential available. Incidence of diseases and insect pests are the major bottlenecks in producing quality mulberry leaves for a second crop and the problem is intensified with addition of Tetranychys sp. and Panonychus sp.  mites in to the pest list of mulberry, which are impairing the quality of mulberry leaves and adversely affecting the biological and economic parameters of silkworm and resultant cocoons. In this background an effort has been made to develop a simple field level damage assessment system for mite injury in mulberry at Central Sericultural Research and Training Institute, Pampore, Jammu and Kashmir, India during 2010 cropping season. A modified method of diseases assessment in mulberry was used to record the mite injury. Mite infestation and percent damage indices were computed following standard procedure and correlated with few metrological parameters. Mite infestation started with 25 percent in the beginning of the study to reach 62 percent during August end from which started declining to reach a low of 18 percent by October end which coincided with initiation of leaf senescence. The percent damage index too followed the similar trend. All the climatic factors influenced positively and significantly in majority on the mite infestation and damage

N2  - Calliptamus italicus (linnaeus, 1758) (Orthoptera: Acrididae) is a polyphagous locust which widely distributed throughout of Europe, Middle East and North Africa. Adults and nymphs are pests of great number of plants including cereals, fabaceous, red and sugar-beet, many solanaceous, cruciferous, sunflower, vegetable and young plants of various fruit plants. The present study for the first time showed that á-amylase is present in the C. italicus. Álpha-amylases have been found to be active in different insect species. Italian Locust á-amylase activity pH was determined to be around 8. Generally, optimal pH is corresponding to the pH prevailing in the midgut from which the enzyme has been extracted. The effect of temperature on the enzyme activity was determined showing that the enzyme was active from 20oC to more than 70oC. Optimum temperature was determined to be 40oC. Sharp decrease in enzyme activity was seen at low temperature e.g. temperature lower than 30oC. It seems that the enzyme was more active at high temperatures than low ones. The enzyme was active on the wide range of the temperatures from 30 to 60oC. Even at 60oC more than 50% of the enzyme activity was present. However, at 70oC only about 30% of the enzyme activity was left and more than 70% of the enzyme activity was lost. Native gel electrophoresis analysis showed that a mixture of different iso-enzyme was present in the gut homogenate. The analysis was shown that 9.0 amylase bands were seen in the gel thus the insect use an array of different alpha amylases for digestion of their food in the midgut. In conclusion it should be mentioned that because the Italian locust feed on different plant species, it needs different á-amylases for the digestion of some carbohydrate the insect encounter during feeding

N2  - Papilio demoleus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae), commonly known as the lime or citrus swallowtail, has a successful dispersal and becoming a major pest of citrus plants in wide area of the world including the Middle East. The insect has been reported to feed on every citrus cultivars and varieties thus it has potential to become a major pest in area where it has been reported. Host plant resistance and natural plant products offer a potentially rational method for the insect pest control since they are safe to the environment as well as human being and non target organisms. Therefore, new control methods such as digestive enzyme inhibitors which interfere with function of the insect digestive enzymes are needed because these compounds affect insect growth and development but not non-target organisms. The aim of the current study was to investigate and characterize ¥á-amylase activity of the larval stage of the lime swallowtail. To do this, the insect larvae were collected and transferred to the lab where their enzymes have been extracted. For enzyme assay soluble starch (1%) has been used. The study showed that ¥á-amylase is present in the insect gut and is used for carbohydrate digestion. The optimum temperature and pH for the activity of ¥á-amylase was 50¨¬C and 8.0, respectively. Native page electrophoresis showed that only one amylase band is present in the insect gut. Understanding of the digestive physiology and ¥á-amylase activity of Citrus Swallowtail is important when new management strategies for this economically important pest are devised

N2  - Rose aphid, Macrosiphum rosae L. (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is a cosmopolitan pest that can cause severe damage to various members of the Rosaceae family. This pest have various hosts during the year, however, it is most commonly found feeding on roses (Mound & Teulon, 1995).The present study for the first time showed that á-amylase is present in the Macrosiphum rosae L. or rose aphid (Hemiptera: Aphididae). á-Amylases have been found to be active in different insect species (Takagi et al., 1971; Baker, 1991; Kazzazi et al., 2005; Zibaee et al., 2008). Rose aphid á-amylase activity pH was determined to be around 7. Generally, optimal pH is corresponding to the pH prevailing in the midgut from which the enzyme has been extracted so these discrepancies seen in midgut pH are related to the different feeding habits and feeding sources. The optimal temperature for Rose aphid á-amylase activity was 45°C, the enzyme was active over a broad temperature range from 20 to 60°C. Analysis of enzyme homogenates by electrophoresis indicated a band in polyacrylamide gel

The morphological characteristics and behaviour at the different developmental stages of the silkmoth are discussed. Colour polymorphism of the larva is observed. The wild silk moth is purely multivoltine in nature and four life cycles are completed in a year. After October-November crop it undergoes diapause at the pupal stage and remained in this stage till 2nd or 3rd week of March of the next year. The average fecundity ranged from 132 -147 in wild race and from 130 to 150 in semidomestic race during the different rearing seasons. The ERR% of wild race ranged from 12.54 to 48.50 with the highest value during Late Kotia (November-December), while in semi-domestic stock it ranged from 14.48 to 60.12 with the highest value during Baisakhi (April-May). The cocoon shell weight ranged from 1.32g to 1.51g in wild race without any significant variations during the different seasons (p>0.05). In semi-domestic race the shell weight ranged from 0.39g to 0.49g without any significant variations during the different seasons (p<0.05). The wild race can be used in breeding for introgression of the genes for higher shell weight to the semi domestic race

N2  - The objective of this work is to study the biology of spiny chrysomelid, Dactylispa dohertyi (Gestro, 1897) on apple plantations (Malus domestica Borkh.) in Jammu and Kashmir. India having varied agro-climatic conditions ranging from tropical, sub-tropical to temperate conditions. Apple is a cherished and economically important fruit crop in Jammu region of J & K State which is severely attacked by both larvae and adults of the pest, Both adults and larvae defoliate Apple plants, reduce their vigour and kill tender shoots. During regular surveys in the apple orchards, the twigs of apple plantations were found damaged heavily by the pest. The infested leaves gave the appearance of being burnt. Thus, an attempt was made to study the biology of this pest in Jammu as no earlier record of the pest has been obtained from the region so far. The insects were reared in the laboratory at room temperature (10.84°C-32.87°C) and relative humidity of 26%-80% on apple plantlets. All life stages except the adults are leaf miners. There are five instar stages with length varying from0.56±0.08 to 2.10±0.22.  The incubation, larval duration and adult longevity for male and females were 4.65±.041, 11.4±2.22, and 7.9±0.69 and 4.45±0.43 days respectively. Thus, the pest has a total life span of 22.12±3.59 days. The present study is an important step in future to record the no. of generations of Dactylispa dohertyi on Malus domestica, and for the timely management of the pest

N2  - Tribolium confusum Duval is an important pest of food processing technology in the world. The use of elevated temperatures or heat shock treatments is a very effective method for managing storage pests. In this study in order to evaluate the mortality of this insect by the use of elevated temperatures, effects of five constant temperatures including 35, 45, 50, 55 and 60°C for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 minutes have been studied on different developmental stages of this pest (5-day larvae, 15-day larvae, pupae and adult). After heating, the samples were kept under temperature of 28±1°C and relative humidity of 65±5%. Results indicated the most susceptive and the most heat-tolerant stage of the insect?s growth were respectively related to the 15-day larvae and pupal stage. Furthermore, it was revealed that the minimum controlling temperature for the 5-day and 15-day larvae is 50°C and for pupae and adult insects is respectively 55°C and 50°C. These results provides, considering the possibility of pest?s existence in different developmental stages in an infected mass, 55 °C for 15 minutes would be effective for managing and controlling life stages of Tribolium confusum

N2  - Chemical composition of the essential oil from Thymus carmanicus Jalas, and its fumigant activity was investigated against two stored product insects, Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) and Sitophilus granarius (L.). Essential oil was isolated via hydrodistillation from dry leaves of T. carmanicus using a modified Clevenger-type apparatus and the chemical composition of the oil was assessed via GC and GC-MS. Twenty one compounds (100% of the total composition) were identified. Carvacrol (41.14%), p-cymene (12.09%), Thymol (6.35%) and &#947;-terpinene (6.21%) were found to be the major compounds of the essential oil. The fumigant toxicity of the essential oil was tested against 1-3 day-old adults of C. maculatus and S. granarius at 27±1ºC and 65±5% r.h. in darkness. The mortality of adults was tested at different concentrations (28.12, 40.62, 53.12 and 65.62 µl/l air ) and different exposure times. The highest concentration (65.62 µl/l air), caused 84% and 56% mortalities with a 5 h exposure On C. maculatus and S. granarius, respsctively. Based on LC50 values, C. maculatus (9.28 µl/l air) was significantly more susceptible than S. granarius (12.71 µl/l air). These results showed that the essential oil of T. carmanicus can play an important role in stored-product protection

N2  - The poplar flat headed borer is one of important pests of poplar trees. This pest, attacks many poplars in physiological weakness condition and causes considerable damage in nurseries, plantation and wood-lots. This survey carried out in 2008 in order to study the effect of distance and planting system on damage rate of Melanophila picta in poplar/alfalfa agroforestry system in complete block design with 3 replications and 5 treatments (stand distances) of poplar/ alfalfa include, 3×4, 3×6/7, 3×8, 3×10 meter and poplar 3×4 meter using two methods. The first method: In order to estimate of damage rate, 5 levels of bark infestation were determined and infested trees numerated in each plot as fallow. 0=0% (without infestation), 1= 1%-20% (infestation from tree base up to 10cm stem height), 2= 21%-40% (infestation from tree base up to 50 cm stem height), 3= 41%-60% (infestation from tree base up to 150 cm stem height), 4= 61%-80% (condensed infestation from tree base  up to 150 cm stem height), 5= 81%-100% (condensed infestation from tree base up to 150cm stem height including side branches). Then damage rate of each stand in plots was numerated.  The second method: the number of holes that made by larvae on the bark of  infested stands were counted in each plot. Data analysis conducted with SPSS software showed a significant difference among treatments in two methods, the poplar treatment had  the most infestation and the most number of holes and 3×10 treatment had the least infestation and the least number of holes

N2  - The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is a most important pest of vegetable, fruit and ornamental crops around the world. The presence of this pest in strawberry fields has been associated with undesirable bronzing of the fruit. Experiments were conducted to assess the efficiency of four plant extract for control F. occidentalis on the strawberry in greenhouse conditions. Taguchi?s design of experiments method has been used for to plan a minimum number of experiments and optimization to control of F. occidentalis. Four factors, which influence the control thrips, were chosen. These factors are type of pesticide (neem extract, coconut soap, tobacco extract and garlic-onion-pepper extract), dosage (recommended and twice dose), droplet size (250 µm and 1000 µm) and application value of pesticide (60 cc and 90 cc per vase). Orthogonal array L8 was used with three replicates. In order to determine the optimum levels of the control factors precisely, analysis of variance was performed. After optimization, the results showed that application value was the most effective factor. The optimum condition for control of F. occidentalis was found to be garlic-onion-pepper extract in twice of recommended dosage (Grind 20 g of garlic, 30 g of onions and 7 g pepper) with droplet size 1000 µm, and 90 cc of pesticide per vase for application value. This study is warranted to determine suitability of garlic-onion-pepper extract, as botanical insecticide, for inclusion in F. occidentalis integrated pest management programs

N2  - In this investigation, the genotoxic and oxidative effects of water soluble extracts of Heterometrus spinifer (Malaysian Forest Scorpion) has been assessed on cultured human blood cells. The extract was added to the cultures at 12 different concentrations (0-2000 mg/L). Micronucleus (MN) test was used to monitor the DNA and chromosomal damage produced by scorpion extracts in vitro. In addition, to assess the oxidative effects, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidant status (TOS) levels were measured. Our results indicated that these extracts did not show genotoxic effects at the tested concentrations. However, the extracts caused dose dependent alterations in both TAC and TOS levels. Based on the findings, it was concluded that the studied scorpion can be consumed safely, but it is necessary to consider the cellular damages which are likely to appear depending on oxidative stress at higher concentrations. It has been also suggested that this in vitro approach for oxidative and genotoxicity assessments may be useful to evaluate the potential health risks of edible scorpion

N2  - Insects and mites are the most damaging of arthropod pests to tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) causing yield losses of 5?55%. Various mite species are associated with tea monocultures. In the Kangra valley, Himachal Pradesh, India red spider mites (Oligonychus coffeae) and scarlet mites (Brevipalpus phoenicis) are prevalent during June-July. For mite control, various conventional acaricides are used but resistance has developed to most of them. In India, few acaricides are recommended for controlling mites in tea. However, there are many new risk reduced selective acaricides which are reported to control mites effectively on crops other than tea. Two seasons field bioefficacy trials of bifenazate (Acramite 50WP) were conducted against red spider mites at different application rates (@ 100, 125, 175, 200, 250 g/ha) and results were compared with the propargite 57 EC (@1 l/ha). In season 1, a single spray of bifenazate @250 g/ha provided 63% control up to 35 days post treatment. Acramite @250, 200, 175, and 125 g/ha provided mite control which was not significantly different from each other. In season 2, a repeat spray was made on day 14 and treatments @250 and 200 g/ha provided 91?93% control up to 35 days. Treatments @ 175 and 125 g/ha provided 84?86% control similar to propargite @1 l/ha. In view of the per cent control of the population over a period of 35 days and depending on the situations, Acramite @200 or 125 g/ha with a follow up spray after 14 days is recommended for the control of tea mites

N2  - Xylophagous beetles (XBs) are one of the economically important pests of woody plants especially in the forest ecosystems. Over 89 genera (4.2% of known genera) and 208 species of parasitoids (Hym.: Chalcidoidea) have been recorded from XBs worldwide. About 264 distinct parasitoid-host associations between Chalcidoidea and XBs were identify. It appears to provide effective control in many cases. XBs are mostly parasitized by species belonging to the chalcidoid families Chalcididae (6%), Encyrtidae (14%), Eulophidae (15%), Eurytomidae (10%), Eupelmidae (11%), Pteromalidae (41%), and rarely by species belonging to other families such as Leucospidae, Mymaridae, Torymidae and Trichogrammatidae. Most of the genera associated with XBs are widely distributed in the same zoogeographical region, while 14 are cosmopolitan. Fourthy genera have limited distributions to a zoogeographical region, of which 70% are found only in the Palaearctic, 17.5% in the Nearctic, and the rest in the Afrotropical, Australian, Neotropical and Oriental regions

N2  - Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varietal susceptibility to the Mediterranean flour moth, Anagasta kuehniella) Zeller, 1879) was evaluated in ten dry land and irrigated wheat that was produced at Azarbayejan, Iran. In this study some biological parameters of pest were affected by evaluated wheat varieties. Investigated parameters were included weight of larvae, emergence rate of pupae, emergence rate of adults, sex ratio and fecundity. Weight of larvae, emergence rate of pupae and sex ratio in the different cultivars at probability levels of 5% were not significant. The varieties on the emergence rate of adults and fecundity at probability levels of 5% had significant difference. As the highest and lowest rates were obtained at varieties of ?Sardari? and ?Shirudi?, respectively. Also the highest and lowest fecundity were observed at varieties of ?Azar 2? and ?Rasad? respectively. Emergence rate of adults in wheat with high protein levels were decreased and fecundity in this varieties increased. According to these experiments different wheat varieties have high resistance to infestion by mediterranean flour moth,  Anagasta Kuehniella (Lep.: Pyralidae) and results of this study is disreble for use in agriculture

N2  - The efficacy of Neem Seed Oil (NSO) in controlling dried fish pest against Dermestes maculatus was investigated in the laboratory. Four concentrations of ethanolic extracts of NSO: 0.125, 0.146, 0.180 mls   were rubbed on the body surface of dried Clarias gariepinus. The results showed that the fish were protected for 6 months against D. maculatus. The efficacy of treatments was however, dosage dependent. The LD50 was 0.125 while 0.275ml significantly halted hatchability and development. A 100% adult mortality rate was recorded at high doses within the first 10 days. NSO was therefore recommended at appropriate dosage for the prevention of insect infestation of dried fish

N2  - The state of Jharkhand (India) is a biodiversity hotspot owing to its topography and geographical features and is blessed with tropical zone dry and wet forests. The mainstay of tribal communities is agriculture. Acridoids have long been credited as forest and crop pest and till date there is no consolidated work dealing with the distribution of locusts and grasshoppers from the state. Keeping this in view the area was surveyed and acridoid fauna has been listed in addition to worked out taxonomy. Keys to subfamilies and genera have been provided. The interaction of concerned samples with their natural habitat was observed very closely and has been listed wherever required. Collection of 421 samples has been worked out that comprised 41 species belonging to 28 genera of 10 subfamilies, 3 families and 4 tribes

N2  - This study evaluated the effect of interspecific competition between the larger grain borer ? Prostephanus truncatus and maize weevil - Sitophilus zeamais on damage by the insects to infested maize grains.  50 g maize grains was weighed into 250 cm3 kliner jars and infested with adult LGB and S. zeamais of between 1 ? 10 days old as follows: 50 g maize + 6 pairs of LGB, 50 g maize + 6 pairs of S. zeamais, 50 g maize + 3 pairs of LGB + 3 pairs of S. zeamais, 50 g maize + 4 pairs of LGB + 2 pairs of S. zeamais, 50 g maize + 2 pairs of LGB + 4 pairs of S. zeamais, 50 g maize + No LGB + No S. zeamais. At 90 days post-infestation, the following data were taken: weight of grain dust (g),  final weight of grains (g),  weight of damage and undamaged  grains (g), number of living adults and number of adult mortality. The result indicated a significantly (p < 0.05) higher % grain damage (91.33) and grain dust (2.42 gm) in maize grains solely infested with S. zeamais. In treatments with mixed insect infestation, treatment with higher population of S.  zeamais (50 g maize grains + 2 pairs of LGB + 4 pairs of S. zeamais) had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher % damage (42.90) than other treatments of mixed insects infestation. However, a significantly (p < 0.05) higher % weight loss (5.01) and weight of grain dust (2.51 gm) was obtained in treatment with higher population of LGB (50g maize grains + 4 pairs LGB + 2 pairs S. zeamais).  Mortality of adult LGB (7.3) was significantly   (p < 0.05) higher in treatment with higher population of LGB (50 g maize grains + 4 pairs LGB + 2 pairs S. zeamais). In two of the treatments with mixed insect infestation, (3 pairs LGB + 3 pairs S.  zeamais) and (2 pairs LGB + 4 pairs S.  zeamais), all the introduced LGB died and no larvae nor pupae was seen in the treatments. The study indicated the ability of S. zeamais to suppress the activities of LGB in interspecific competition

N2  - The study examines change in the proximate composition of maize grains infested by varied population of maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais). 50 gm maize grains (SUWAN-1) was weighed into 250 cm3 Kilner glass jars and separately infested with 5pairs, 10 pairs and 15 pairs of S. zeamais for ninety days. A 250 cm3 Kilner jar filled with 50 gm uninfested maize grains served as control. All treatments and control were replicated four times and arranged on the work-table in the laboratory using completely randomized design. At 90 day post-infestation of the maize grains, data were collected on damage indices such as % grain weight loss, % grain damage, weight of grain dust and final population of S. zeamais. The proximate composition of the damaged and undamaged maize grains was determined by analyzing the maize grains for total protein, fat, starch, sugar, moisture and ash contents using the standard analytical method (AOAC, 1970). The data on proximate analysis was correlated with final population of S. zeamais, weight of grain dust, % grain weight loss and % grain damage. The results indicated that S. zeamais infestation of maize grains had a significant (P < 0.05) effect on protein, starch and moisture content of the infested maize grains. The damage to maize grains and depletion of its proximate composition directly correlated with the population of S. zeamais. Adequate preservation of stored maize grains from infestation by S. zeamais is therefore essential to reduce loss during storage and depletion of nutritional composition of stored maize grains

N2  - Endemism richness can be interpreted as the specific contribution of an area to global biodiversity. The degree of endemism for an area is often cited as a measure of the uniqueness of the fauna and consequently is important for prioritizing sites for conservation. Turkey has continental properties considering both species richness and endemism richness in terms of its covered area on the Earth. Turkish Cerambycoidea includes a total of 816 species group taxa (712 species and 104 subspecies belonging to 130 genera of 56 tribes of 12 subfamilies of 2 families). The endemism ratio for Turkish fauna of Cerambycoidea is 41.42% in 9 subfamilies of 2 families. Because, only 3 subfamilies in the family Cerambycidae (Prioninae Latreille, 1802; Aseminae Thomson, 1861 and Spondylidinae Audinet-Serville, 1832) do not include any endemic species. Consequently, Turkey can be interpreted as a ?biodiversity hotspot? on the Earth in terms of the fauna of Cerambycoidea that is an important animal group for Turkish biodiversity in respect to both species richness and endemism richness

N2  - Bionomics of two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, and its egg predator Scolothrips longicornis Priesner was studied in the southeast of the Tehran province, Varamin from 11th July to 22th September 2010 on six bean cultivars including Goli, Akhtar, Sadaf, Parastoo, Talash and Baker. The mean population densities of the overall life stages of T. urticae and S. longicornis per leaf on Goli (36.27 and 2.87, respectively) were significantly more than other cultivars. The spatial distribution of T. urticae and S. longicornis was determined by the following four methods: index of dispersion, Lloyd's mean crowing, Taylor's power law and Iwao's patchiness regression, whereas Morisita's coefficient of dispersion was calculated for T. urticae on different crops. The index of dispersion, Morisita's index and Lloyd's mean crowding indicated an aggregated pattern for spatial distribution of this mite and their predator on all bean cultivars. The spatial distribution pattern of T. urticae and S. longicornis using Taylor's power law and Iwao's patchiness in most cases was aggregated and in few cases random. The linear regression between the predator and prey population densities indicated a density-dependant predation by S. longicornis on T. urticae. Spatial distribution parameters of two-spotted spider mite and its predator can be used to outline a sampling program, estimate population density of these mites and efficiency of the predator for using in IPM programs

N2  - Earthworms play an important role in soil ecology. Their actions are favored by the activity of the microbial communities that inhabit the alimentary canal of these organisms. The main aim of this work was the identification of the microbial flora of the alimentary canal of native earthworms species of Glossoscolecidae (Enantiodrilus borelli and Pontoscolex corethrurus) of the Neotropical region. The animals were collected in Chicligasta, Tucumán, Argentina. The alimentary canal was removed by dissection and later macerated in physiologic solution. The stumps were isolated and identified by standard microbiological procedures on the bases of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. Twelve samples were isolated and ten identified, among them Marinococcus sp., Caryophanon sp., Planococcus sp., two stumps of Oscillospira sp., Bacillus sp., two stumps of Pseudomonas sp., Acidiphilium sp., Azomonas sp. These earthworms were found to have a wide and diverse microbial flora in the alimentary canal, with both, endogenous communities and some that entered the worm by ingestion

N2  - Subterranean termite, Amitermes vilis (Hagen) is one of the most important insect pests in Iran, which cause a serious economic damage to agricultural and urban areas, natural resources, and historic monuments. Toxicity of five insecticides including Agenda EC 25 (fipronil), Consult EC 100 (hexaflumuron), Admiral EC 100 (pyriproxyfen), Confidor SC 350 (imidacloprid), Reldan EC 400 (chlorpyrifos methyl) were evaluated against A. vilis. To determine LC50 of the insecticides, bioassay was carried out on worker termites of A. vilis. The LC50 values for fipronil, pyriproxyfen, hexaflumuron, imidacloprid and chlorpyrifos methyl were 3.48, 9.56, 32.02, 2.02 and 0.09 ppm, respectively. The LT50 value of pyriproxyfen was shorter than hexaflumuron. The results showed that fipronil and imidacloprid were respectively the most effective insecticides for a short term control of the termite. It could be concluded that the toxicity of pyriproxyfen was higher than hexaflumuron

N2  - In sericulture certain general disinfectants are available in the market via; Formalin, Bleaching  powder, Chlorine dioxide etc which are having certain disadvantages like corrosiveness, non-acceptable odour, irritation to eyes and throat, carcinogenicity and user non friendliness. DECOL, a new wide spectrum general disinfectant has been formulated by SSTL, Kodathi, Bangalore with certain phenolic derivatives based on their biocidal properties along with surfactant, solvent and water as a diluent which has certain advantages over existing disinfectants. Decol is non corrosive to metals and alloys, pleasant and acceptable odour, safe to the  user and to the  environment, bio-degradable, economical and cost effective. Keeping in view, the above field problems, Decol has been tested in the laboratory in simulated conditions and found very effective in controlling secondary pebrine contamination in silkworm crops. Decol was tested and certified as safe to use in sericulture by Industrial Toxicology Research Centre (ITRC), CSIR, Lucknow, UP, Govt. of India

N2  - Eri culture is mostly confined to the Brahmaputra valley of Assam and in few districts of the neighbouring states mainly Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. Eri culture is also spreading in different non-traditional states like, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Chhattishgarh etc. The eri silkworm, Samia ricini (Donovan) is multivoltine and polyphagous in nature feeding on a number of food plants namely castor, Ricinus communis, Kesseru, Heteropanax fragrans, Tapioca, Manihot utilissima, Payam, Evodia flaxinifolia and Barpat, Ailanthus grandis  and several others. Eri silkworm is reared indoor conditions for production of cocoons. Though eri silkworm can be reared throughout the year still there is a variation in some commercial characters in different seasons. To observe its seasonal variations in commercial characters a study was undertaken using a promising eri silkworm, Borduar eco-race feeding with castor. The highest larval weight (7.32 g), average fecundity (580 Nos.) and ERR (94.7%) was recorded during October-November. The highest single cocoon weight (4.01 g) was observed during August-September. Hence, it has been illustrated that autumn is the best season for eri silkworm rearing to improve productivity of eri silk

N2  - This study was carried out to reveal the reasons of extreme insecticide usage for aphid management at lettuce production areas in East Mediterranean Region of Turkey and to develop solution for this problem. While there are seven different aphid species that were determined in lettuce field of the region Hyperomyzus lactucae (L.), Myzus (N.) persicae (Sulzer), and Nasonovia ribisnigri (Mosley), (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is most importanat ones among them. The field surveys of biological control agent in lettuce fields show us that Metasyrphus corollae (F.) (Diptera: Sryphidae) and Sphaerophoria scripta (L.) were determined as important biological control agents on lettuce aphids, but the most important and hopefull agent was Fusarium subglutinans, entomopathogen fungi. Chemical control methods to suppress lettuce aphids populations revealed that among active ingredients named Thiomethoxam, Spirotetramat, Pymetrozine used against lettuce aphids, the first two ones have to be applied before closing heart of the lettuce plant. Thus, pest population can be limited under the economic loss threshold

N2  - The Sunn pest, E. intergriceps, the bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, and wheat thrips, H. tritici are the major pests of wheat and other cereals in a wide area of the world. All these three insect species could produce damage to the wheat, to some extent. So the aim of the current study was to determine the á and â-Galactosidase of the three mentioned insect pests. Thus, these insects were collected from the wheat farm and their guts (the Sunn pest and the aphid) were removed. However, regarding the thrips, because of the small body, whole body used in order to extract the enzymes. The enzymes, including á and â-galactosidase activity were measured by the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-á-D-galactopyranoside (pNPáGal) and p-nitrophenyl-â-D-galactopyranoside (pNPâGal), respectively using phosphate citrate buffer (pH5.0). Galactosidases were active in all three insect species tested. However, there were significant differences in activities of the two enzymes tested. The greatest activities of the two enzymes, á- and â- galactosidases, were found in the Sunn pest, Eurygaster integriceps, and the least activities of the two tested enzymes, á- and â- galactosidases, were found in the aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi. Activities of the enzyme were modest in the thrips, Haplothrips tritici. The greatest amount of á- and â- galactosidases in the Sunn pest makes sense since the Sunn pest is the main pest in the wheat farm that can feed on wheat grains. In the wheat grains, the highest amount of glycoproteins and glycolipids are present. Thus, it has been known that these enzymes (á- and â- galactosidases) are active on digestion of glycoproteins and glycolipids

N2  - Sunn pest (Eurygaster integriceps Putton), Bird cherry-oat aphid (Ropalosiphum padi L.) and wheat thrips (Haplothrips tritici Kurd.) are the most important pests which damage on wheat. They are dependent on their carbohydrate enzymes because of their nutrition diet. The weakness of wheat is caused because of their feeding on plant's carbohydrate materials. In this study the activity of three enzymes including: á-amylase, á and â-glucosidase were assayed in the midgut, salivary glands of sunn pest, the gut of wheat aphid and wheat thrips. Levels of these enzymes activities were different. In sunn pest's midgut the highest activity was found for â-glucosidase and the lowest was for á-amylase whereas in sunn pest salivary gland the highest activity was detected for á-glucosidase and the lowest in á-amylase. In the Aphid gut enzyme activity was different so that the highest activity was detected in á-amylase but the lowest in â-glucosidase. In wheat thrips the highest enzyme activity was detected in â-glucosidase and no á-amylase activity was observed. Comparing these four samples, the alpha amylase activity had the highest level in sunn pest's midgut and the lowest in wheat thrips. The highest activity of á, â-glucosidase enzyme was as the same as á-amylase and in sunn pest midgut was the highest. The lowest activity of á, â- glucosidase was found in wheat thrips and wheat aphid, respectively. So the most important pest is E.integriceps  because of its carbohydrate enzymes

N2  - Alcidodes signatus Boheman has been recorded as a serious pest of bean with adults feeding externally on the soft parts of the plant and larvae feeding internally and inducing galls. Though the weevil feeds on other host plants like Capsicum sp., Indigofera tinctoris, Ipomoea nil, Parthenium sp., and Salvia sp., breeding and gall induction has been studied only on Phaseolus vulgaris. Adults were active from July to November and population peak was recorded during September-October months, coinciding with the availability of host plant. Copulation lasted for about half an hour and a maximum of three larvae (Plate 1, Fig. C & D) were recorded from a single gall. Incubation period lasted for 5 to 7 days. Total number of instars observed during the study were five. Larval period lasted for 35 to 42 days and pupal period lasted for 10-12 days. Newly emerged weevil remains in the pupal chamber for 3-7 days and its color changes to become typical of the adult. Percentage infestation recorded during the period was 70%. Total life span varies from 50-60 days and atleast two generations were observed during the period under study

N2  - In search for alternatives of conventional pesticides, plant essential oils have been widely investigated. Essential oils from aromatic plants are recognized as proper alternatives to chemical fumigants. In this research fumigant toxicity of essential oil of citrus peels was studied against three most common stored-product insects, Tribolium confusum, Callosobruchus maculatus and Rhyzopertha dominica. Five concentrations of essential oil were tested with four replicated at 24 and 48 h times with 30 adult insect in each replication. The citrus peels have medicinal and insecticide properties. The essential oil was obtained from the fruit peels using hydro distillation that were dried naturally at room temperature (23?27°C). After 24 h of exposure, the LC50 values were estimated to be 259, 158 and 118 µl/l air and after 48 h were 134, 106 and 86 respectively for each insect. It was found that R. dominica adults were more susceptible to the oil than others and T. confusum adults were less susceptible. Increasing the essential oil concentration and exposed time increased the fumigant toxicity of essential oils on insects. These results suggest that citrus peel essential oil as potential fumigant and may be used as a safe pesticide for the management of stored-product insects

N2  - Rice odonates are beneficial predators that can help control insect pests in rice, so playing a valuable role in the rice ecosystem. Morphological classification is not reliable at the taxonomic level for some species. Thus, molecular techniques may be used to resolve species more accurately. Normally, genetic DNA sequence amplification is used in molecular identification. This study modified and developed one stage of the DNA extraction process to permit DNA extraction from a single insect leg. After cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) amplification, nucleotide banding was conducted to determine the efficiency of the extracted DNA. The results showed that this modification to DNA extraction could yield sufficient DNA to amplify the COI gene, and thus be a practical tool for detecting odonates using molecular techniques

N2  - In the present study insect pest complexes on pulses has been observed and their association with host plant was investigated. The pest species infesting different parts of this legume plant were foliage, flower, pod and leaf. The status of these pests has been determined depending upon the rate of their feeding and extent of damages caused by them.  Pulses are important food crops due to their high protein and essential amino acid content. Like many leguminous crops, pulses play a key role in crop rotation due to their ability to fix nitrogen. India is largest producer of pulses in the world with 25 per cent share in global production. Grasshoppers consume flower buds and especially early pods that results in yield loss and a delay in maturity due to delayed pod set. Adults and nymphs feed on green plant material, creating holes on leaves and pods pose the greatest threat to pulse production. All the seventy districts of Uttar Pradesh have been surveyed to collect the acridoid pests of pulses. Fourteen species representing fourteen genera of grasshoppers have been recorded belonging to three families, six subfamilies and two tribes

The result showed that, during the encountering, the intersection time of two tracks and net relative movements for female-male group were longer than female-female group or male-male group; while the reaction time was shorter than the latters. A complete mating of B. lineolata included three stages, i.e. Pair-bonding, Mating and Post-copulatory guarding. The average time of Pair-bonding is 2.16 mins, and 10.28 mins, 5.37 mins for Mating and Post-copulatory guarding, respectively. In mating experiments with different sex ratios, the mating number fluctuated regularly, and it was greatly different in mating number for male or female individuals. The virgin female or male, takes more total mating time longer duration for single mating, higher insert genital frequency than un-virgin ones. The mating on the host plant had higher mating rate and longer duration time than on the open ground. The mating behavior in the field test was similar with that in the laboratory experiment

N2  - At the recent years, thiram, a dithiocarbamate compound is used as a fungicide to protect crops against a wide variety of plant pathogens. In this work, Chicken embryos were studied for the screening of skeletal malformation caused after application of thiram. On the other hand, the toxicity of thiram to chicken liver cells culture was determined. The compound was dissolved in acetone, then a volume of 50 µl of different doses of it was injected into the yolk sac after 72 hours of incubation and the embryos were harvested after 19 day of incubation. The results showed that exposure of the embryos to thiram increased mortality with a LD50 value of 3.5 µg/egg and malformations including clubfoot and unossified caudal vertebrae. No significant difference was observed in wet weight of the embryos. Thiram also exhibited the cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects against liver cells with an IC50 value of 5.2 µg/ml. The present study proposes that thiram can affect the growth and ossification of the chicken embryos, which are developed outside the mother

N2  - Like many countries, water is one of the most important limiting factors for poplar plantation in Iran. So there is essential to study water amount needed for every poplar species and clones. During the years 2009-2010 effects of irrigation intervals on poplar lace bug, Monosteria unicostata (Mulsant and Rey) damage rate were studied on the nine poplar clones in Alborz Research Station of Karaj. This study was carried out under a split plot design. Three irrigation intervals with 4, 8 or 12 days interval of irrigations were considered as main experimental plots and nine poplar clones were secondary treatments. This experiment had three repetitions. Two ways analyze of variance were performed. Analyze variance table showed significant differences between irrigation intervals and poplar species and clones (á < 0.01). Poplar lace bug density was significantly higher under 4 days irrigation interval than two others treatments. The density of the pest was significantly highest in P. trichocarpa. A significant interaction was found between irrigation intervals and the poplar clones. It means that more irrigation could provide suitable conditions for growth and development of M. unicostata on every poplar clones

N2  - Morphometric analysis of the external parts and the alimentary canal as well as the stadia time of each post embryonic developmental stage of variegated grasshopper, Zonocerus variegatus was carried out. Data collected included body weight, length of pronotum, prothoracic  leg, mesothoracic leg, metathoracic leg, antenna, whole body and gut. The result of the study showed that the size of the measured parts and the body weight of the insects increased progressively during the post embryonic development. There was a strong positive relationship between the body length and body weight (0.858) on one hand and between the body weight and antenna length (0.952) on the other hand. The body weight and body length slope between 1st ? 5th instar was less than the slope between the 6th instar and adult stage. There were six nymphal stages and adult stage for the insect. The number of days spent in lower instars was less than those spent in higher instars. The nymphal periods were 7.0, 7.6, 10.0, 19.1, 20.5 and 46.9 days respectively for 1st - 6th instars. The total days spent in adult stage ranged between 101.9-127.9 days. The relevance of this information in the understanding of Z. variegatus behavior and possible control was discussed

N2  - Of 5416 mammal species in the world, 1116 are bat species. Bats belong to the order Chiroptera, which has the meaning of hand winged. Bats feed on insects, fruits, nectar, blood, some invertebrate and vertebrate. It is determined that 36 bat species live in Turkey, one of which is frugivorous and others insectivorous. Water bat, Myotis daubentonii which was recorded first time from Bolu province generally feeds on water insects. Water bat is often located near bodies of water, because they hunt insects flying over water. It can be said that the distribution areas of this species changes with existing of water. This species was encountered inside small cracks and hollows on cave wall and ceiling, located adjacent to a small waterfall. Diagnostic characters, habitat, fur colour, morphometric data and distribution of this species in Turkey are given depending on one female and five male specimens.  Bats feeding on insects, laying their eggs on  water are affected adversely because of irregularity of water regimen

N2  - In insects, lipase enzymes have key roles in utilizing, storing and transmitting lipids. Experimental compounds such as metal salts like potassium phosphate, magnesium nitrate and NaCl, buffers like EDTA and Tris, SDS and ethanol are commonly used in laboratory studies, and lack of knowledge to their possible effects on enzyme activity can lead to inaccurate conclusions in studies involve these enzymes. In this study, effects of these compounds on midgut lipase activity of Galleria mellonella that is an ideal insect for physiologic researchs for It?s simple rearing and large larvae, are evaluated. In order to this, The last instar larvae were dissected, samples were obtained and the effects of these compounds on enzyme activity were measured spectrophotometrically in 5 different concentrations. As obtained results, enzyme activity was reduced by 75% ethanol, 5 mMol magnesium nitrate and various concentrations of SDS, and was increased by NaCl and potassium phosphate in 5 mMol concentration. Concentrations up to 4 mMol of NaCl, potassium phosphate and magnesium nitrate, and also concentrations of 25, 50, 85 and 96 % of ethanol had no effect on enzyme activity

N2  - Bionomic and life table parameters of Euphyllura straminea Loginova were carried out at three constant temperatures (20¨¬C, 25¨¬C and 30¨¬C) on olive seedlings throughout one complete generation. Durations and percentage of mortalities for different developmental stages were estimated. Results revealed that egg incubation period, durations of nymphal stage and the five nymphal instars were decreased as temperature increased from 20¨¬C to 30¨¬C. Moreover, the highest percentage of mortality was occurred throughout 1st nymphal instar at 30¨¬C, while the lowest percentage was occurred throughout 4th nymphal instar. The values of zero of development for different developmental instars were 11.96, 13.30, 13.40, 13.10, 15.40 and 14.50 for egg 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th  nymphal instars  and nymphal stages, respectively. Results showed that the highest percentage of adults' emergence and sex ratio were occurred at 25¨¬C being 92.6 % and 1: 1.8, respectively. Also, results revealed that temperature had highly significant effects on durations of pre-oviposition, oviposition and post-oviposition periods as well as adult longevity for both sexes. These durations were decreased as temperature increased from 20¨¬C to 30¨¬C. Female fecundity and egg hatchability were affected by prevailing temperature. The highest numbers of deposited eggs was 277.2 eggs/ female and egg hatchability was 87.66 % occurred at 25¨¬C. Results of life table parameters showed that the highest percentage of egg hatchability and the lowest percentages of apparent and real mortality as well as the highest numbers of adult¡¯s survival were occurred at 25¨¬C. The highest net reproductive rate (R) was occurred at 25¨¬C being 88.91 eggs / female. The shortest generation time (GT) was 46.66 day occurred at 30¨¬C. Both intrinsic rate of increase (rm) and finite rate (¥ë) were occurred for those reared at 25¨¬C and 30¨¬C. Both values were 0.03 and 1.03 occurred at the two tested temperatures. The shortest population doubling time (Dt) was occurred at 25¨¬C being 27.95 days. All these parameters revealed that 25¨¬C seemed to be optimal temperature for rearing E. straminea

N2  - The present work presents new contributions to the knowledge of the subfamilies Prioninae, Lepturinae, Dorcadioninae and Lamiinae that are 4 of 5 richest subfamilies in terms of diversity among cerambycids, of Turkey. The specimens for this study were collected over various years (2001-2012) from different localities in Adana, Balıkesir, Bolu, Düzce, İçel, Kahramanmaraş, Karaman, Muğla, Niğde and Osmaniye provinces in Turkey. As a result of the work, a total of 58 species (25 of them into subspecies level) belonging to 37 genera of 20 tribes of 4 subfamilies were determined from Turkey. One species of them is recorded from Turkey for the second time. Two species of them are the first record for Southern Turkey. Also, four species for Central Anatolian Region, six species for Mediterranean Region and three species for Eastern Mediterranean Region are recorded for the first time. Moreover, a total of fourty-five species are the first record for various provinces (8 for Adana, 4 for Balıkesir, 14 for İçel, 3 for Kahramanmaraş, 10 for Niğde, 6 for Osmaniye) in Turkey. Furthermore, about 15% of the examined taxa in the present work comprise of endemic taxa for Turkey.

N2  - The Indian oak tasar silkworm, Antheraea proylei Jolly behaves uni- and weak bivoltinism depending upon the prevailing environmental conditions. The silkworm undergoes pupal diapause for about eight months (June to January) after spring crop. During prolonged preservation, large quantity of seed cocoons are lost due to erratic emergence, pupal mortality, decrease in vigour, etc. The main reason behind erratic emergence could be attributed to weak voltinism of the silkworm. However, the maintenance of suitable environmental conditions during the preservation of cocoon plays a key role for emergence of moths. The summer or autumn crop can be taken up by breaking the pupal diapause subjecting to photoperiodic treatment of the seed cocoons. Considering the problems in relation to emergence of moths encountered by the silkmoth, observations were made exclusively on different aspects of emergence pattern of A. proylei during normal grainage period in spring crop and long preservation (pupal diapausing) period in the present study

N2  - Reproductive efficiency of economic insects and its rearing performances are greatly affected by hormonal activities together with the environmental and cultural practices. Two different hormones were selected for tropical application on muga silkworm (Antheraea assamensis Helfer) to study their effect on the overall rearing performances. JH-III (Juvenile hormone) in three different concentrations and 20-Hydroxyecdysone i.e. 5, 10 and 15 µg/g body weight (w/w) were applied exogenously on head region of 5th instars 1st day larvae of muga silkworm. Larvae treated with higher concentration of 20-hydroxyecdysone (15 µg) and JH-III (10 µg) were significantly superior in terms of cocoon formation (86.2±3% and 78.4±2.97%), cocoon weight (6.174±0.34gm and 5.616±0.07gm), pupal weight (5.888±0.10gm and 5.078±0.04gm), shell weight (0.576±0.005gm and 0.532±0.01gm) compared to that of control. Similarly, the length of ovary (10.26±0.22 cm and 9.38±0.12cm) and fecundity (179.3±8.35 nos and 163.6±2.97 nos) in the treated larvae was also higher. Application of JH-III has resulted in the prolongation of larval period (8.0±0.44days) however, treatment with 20-hydroxyecdysone has shortened the larval period (5.8±0.37days) with higher silk ratio (8.346 ±0.29 %). Thus, JH-III and 20-hydroxyecdysone can successfully be applied for ovarian development which in turn can exhibit reproductive efficiency of muga silkworm.

N2  - Chronological variations during embryonic development of normal eggs of Antheraea assamensis Helfer were recorded from 24 h to till hatching.  During 10-16 h of the embryonic development, the ventral plate is formed and by 24 h trough shaped embryonic premodium floats in yolk and the protocephalon and protocorn are separated by transverse furrows. After 96 h the embryo became C-shaped.  Although, mouth parts are yet not developed completely but they were at the advance stage of development. The thoracic region is clearly divisible into three thoracic segments. After 120 h, organogenesis in embryo takes place. The antennae bear segments and head region was detachable into three segments. The head capsule formation completed in after 144 h and mouth parts got matured. Three segmented antennae with antennal setae, the mandibles and labrum are well developed. After 168 h old, mandible become selerotised and pigmented at distal ends. Larval eyes appear as six brown spot on either side of head. The spiracles are clearly visible on the sides of the body. Fully developed muga silkworm larva comes out from the egg cell after 8th day of oviposition rupturing the anterior part of egg shell by the mandibles.

N2  - Whiteflies (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) are one of the most intricate pests to control in gerbera grown under polyhouse conditions. Whiteflies have shown an ability to develop resistance to many pesticides so an attempt was made to test various pesticide biopesticides combinations. To test the efficacy of some pesticide, biopesticides, their combinations and cow urine extract against whitefly in gerbera an experiment was designed at Badamawala polyhouse, Vikasnagar Dehradun during 2011. An experiment was conducted in polyhouse conditions to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of synthetic pesticides (Imidacloprid-T1 and T2, Acetamiprid-T3 and T4), biopesticides (NeemAzal-T5), their combinations (T6-T1+T5, T7-T3+T5) and extract containing cow urine and garlic paste (T8). Whitefly population was assessed by randomly selecting 5 flowers along with stem and leaves for each replicate just before the spray (pre count) and 1st, 5th, 7th and 10th day after spray (post count). Monitoring the population during the test period revealed that all the treatments were found superior over the control as per mean whitefly population count. In addition the spray of cow urine extract also showed results parallel with the treatment T5. Besides the extract of cow urine fermented with garlic extract showed good efficacy against white fly suggesting a prospect for organic production of gerberas in India.

N2  - Detailed bionomics of Apple longicorn borer, Aeolesthes holosericea Fabricius has been recorded for the first time in India on apple plantations. The insects were reared in the laboratory at temperature ranging between 10.84°C-32.87°C and relative humidity of 26%-80% on apple billets.  Larvae being wood borers cause considerable damage to apple trees. There are seven instar stages. Larvae of apple longicorn beetle while feeding on the apple trees  took about 17.23±0.21 months and 13.66±3.31 days to develop from first instar to mature larva. This period included the overwintering period of 4-5 months. Adult longevity for male and females were 10.55±0.44 days, 17.23±0.21 months and 13.66±3.31 days and days respectively. The pest has a total life span of approximately two years (25.16±1.83 months). So far, no report is available on culture of Aeolesthes holosericea Fabricius under laboratory conditions to facilitate evaluation of developmental stages against known control measures and the life cycle and ethology of this insect pest is indispensible for developing its control measures in the present area of study. It is also impractible to study the complete life cycle of Aeolesthes holosericea in its natural condition because regular tracking of feeding and boring larvae within the tree trunk and cutting of the tree for each observation till the completion of life cycle is not feasible. Therefore a need was felt to develop a simple method of rearing Aeolesthes holosericea in laboratory conditions in order to identify susceptible stages to effective control methods

N2  - Lymantria obfuscata Walker is a polyphagus pest infesting a wide variety of fruit and forest trees. The objective of this work is to study the detailed life cycle of Indian gypsy moth (Lymantria obfuscata Walker) on apple plantations (Malus domestica Borkh.), which is a cherished and economically important fruit crop in Jammu region of J & K State, India and is severely attacked by the larvae off Indian gypsy moths. Larvae defoliate apple plants, reduce their vigour and sometimes the infestation is so severe that it leads to mass destruction of apple plants. Thus, an attempt was made to study the biology of this pest in Jammu as no earlier record of the pest has been obtained from the region so far. Incidence of the pest was determined by the defoliated leaves fallen from the trees which indicates an identification mark for locating the pest. Biological studies include morphometric measurements of different stages from egg to adult. Incubation period varies from 286.0 to 329.0 days (305.2±5.26 days) (mean±SE). Larval period varies from 37 to 60 days (49.8±2.43) days. Pupal period ranges from 12 to 14 days (13.4±0.27 days). Adult longevity of male and female is 3.5 to 6 days (4.45±0.25) and 7 to 9 days (7.60±0.0.20 days) respectively. Besides biology, host plants and distribution of the pest are also included in the paper.

N2  - The current study was conducted to determine the influence of wheat cultivars and wheat sown dates on aphids populations. Three cultivars of wheat (Gemiza-9; Giza-168 and Sakha-93) were sown on five sown dates (1st October, 16th October, 31st October, 15th November and 1st December) throughout two successive seasons 2011 and 2011 at Qalyubiya Governorate, Egypt. Three aphids species; Rhopalosiphum maidis, Rhopalosiphum padi and  Sitobion avenae were found infesting wheat plants. R. maidis was the most abundant species followed by R. padi and S. avenae. Plants that sown on early December were significantly infested by aphids. The Gemiza-9 appeared to be the most resistant cultivar, while Giza-168 appeared to be the most susceptible one for aphid infestations. It is concluded from the study that suitable wheat sown  date is from early October until mid November and the Gemiza-9 cultivar is resistant to the attack of aphid’s population, this cultivar should be promoted in the areas of high aphid infestation. The selection of suitable wheat cultivar and wheat sown date can be important tool for IPM program in this area ecosystem.

N2  - Reduvius personatus is commonly known as the masked bed bug hunter. It is a European species which has successfully adapted to life in North America, where it was introduced at an unknown date. My study of the biology, ecology and distribution of this insect is from 1997-2012 in southern Quebec and Ontario, Canada. Adults were found in spring and summer, both inside and outside dwellings. Third and fifth nymphs were present indoor during the winter as well. Third and fifth nymphal instars exhibited dormancy during the first and second winter, respectively. Nymphs exude a sticky substance which facilitates body-masking with dust particles. This camouflage has given rise to the alternative names “masked bug” or “masked bed bug hunter”. Mating occurs in a lateral orientation. Four successive generations reared over a decade showed a two-year life cycle. The adult morphology, first instar, characteristics of egg, embryonic development, feeding, mating, and cannibalistic behaviour were studied and are illustrated. The distribution in its adapted (North America) and native (Western Palaearctic) habitats was studied and mapped. This insect was not found to be harmful to humans and household pets. This is the first long-term natural history study of R. personatus, in North America.

N2  - Jute yellow mite, Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks) (Acari: Tarsonemidae) is one of the destructive pests of jute, which has been expanded in recent years in Bangladesh. Jute plants of tossa (Corchorus olitorius L.) varieties were considered as treatments viz., O-9897, O-72, OM-1 and O-795. The paired plot treatments (miticide treated and miticide untreated cintrol) were laid out under field condition. The yellow mite impact was studied on three stages of jute plants: 60 DAS (day after sowing), 90 DAS and 120 DAS. The higher number of mite stages observed upto 90 DAS then declined afterward upto 120 DAS in var. OM-1 among four C. olitorius varieties. A damage index scale (0-5) was to assess yellow mite injury to jute plants. The percent infestation and damage index was also used to relate yellow mite injury to different yield contributing characters of plants infested at three different phenological stages. The yield contributing characters of untreated plots showed significant damage at 60, 90 and 120 DAS in C. olitorius varieties compared to treatment plots. The highest fibre yield losses due to mite infestation was found in the variety OM-1 (77.93%) followed by O-795 (75.40%), O-72 (69.59%) and the lowest was in O-9897 (69.35%); the highest stick yield losses was in the variety OM-1(75.56%) followed by O-795 (71.44%) and O-72 (65.87%), the lowest was in O-9897 (65.75%) and the highest seed yield losses was in the variety O-795 (49.08%) followed by OM-1 (47.46%) and O-72 (39.10%), the lowest was in O-9897 (29.94%) under field condition. High yellow mite population in the untreated check decreased plant growth and showed significant yield loss in the variety OM-1

N2  - The yellow mite, Polyphagotarsonemus latus Banks (Acari: Tarsonemidae) population is one of the most destructive pests of jute crop (Corchorus capsularis L.) in Bangladesh. Jute plants of deshi (Corchorus capsularis L) varieties were considered as treatments viz., CVL-1, CVE-3, BJC-7370 and BJC-83. The paired plot treatments (miticide treated and miticide untreated cintrol) were laid out under net house condition. The effect of yellow mite, Polyphagotarsonemus latus Banks, were studied on three stages of jute plants: 60 DAS, 90 DAS and 120 DAS. The higher number of mite stages observed upto 90 DAS then declined afterward upto 120 DAS in var. BJC-7370 among four C. capsularis varieties. A damage index scale (0-5) was to assess yellow mite injury to jute plants. The percent infestation and damage index was also used to relate yellow mite injury to number of leaves, leaf area, fresh leaf weight, dry leaf weight, soluble solids, plant height, base diameter, fibre weight, stick weight, number of flowers per plant, number of pods, pod weight per plant, seed per pod, seed weight and 1000 seed weight of plants infested at three different phenological stages. The yield contributing characters of untreated pots showed significant damage at 60, 90 and 120 DAS in C. capsularis varieties compared to treatment pots. The highest fibre yield losses due to mite infestation was found in the variety BJC-7370 (65.10%) followed by CVE-3 (61.46%), CVL-1 (58.83%) and the lowest was in BJC-83 (52.97%); the highest stick yield losses due to mite infestation was found in the variety BJC-7370 (51.29%) followed by CVE-3 (47.54%), BJC-83 (46.49%) and the lowest was in CVL-1 (44.21%) and the highest seed yield losses due to mite infestation was found in the variety BJC-7370 (38.25%) followed by CVE-3 (31.93%), CVL-1 (29.28%) and the lowest was in BJC-83 (28.89%) for Corchorus capsularis under net house condition. High yellow mite population in the untreated check decreased plant growth and showed significant yield loss in the variety BJC-7370.

N2  - On the basis of controlling spider mites as a serious pest in four greenhouse vegetables, some experiments were conducted to measure the interaction between the biological control agent, Scolothrips longicornis Priesner, and host plant species. The predation and oviposition rates of the predator were monitored as two indices of the predator fitness on the host plants. It was hypothesized that plant chlorophyll content and leaf surface quality can affect this biocontrol agent. The results showed that plant leaf tissue affected the oviposition rate of the predator. As the highest oviposition rate was seen on eggplant (9.70±1.03 larvae) and the lowest belonged to sweet pepper (3.70±0.85 larvae). Predation mean was affected by host plant, also; the result was somehow different, as the highest predation mean was recorded for tomato (6.10±0.88 unfed mite/plant) and sweet pepper was not favorable for prey searching, either. In addition, the chlorophyll content of the host plant could indirectly affect the predator via prey feeding; however, the results indicated the final decisions of predator are related to more than one factor in host plant and prey

N2  - The paper to be published is based on an annotated checklist of Leptomias Faust (Entiminae: Curculionidae: Coleoptera) comprising 131 species with their updated nomenclature, synonyms and distribution. The analysis indicates that the genus is predominantly distributed in Oriental region. China (including Tibet) and India are the areas where the genus is well known, particularly the Himalayan and Sub-Himalayan regions. Currently, China is the single largest country with 81 species, followed by India with 35 species of Leptomias

N2  - Toxicity of the insect growth regulator lufenuron and two neonicotinoids, dinotefuran and thiamethoxam, for the alfalfa weevil, Hypera postica (Gyllenhal, 1813), was determined through exposure of the second instar larvae and adults to dipped alfalfa leaves under laboratory conditions at 25±1 °C, 60±5% RH ,16:8 L:D. Based on mode of action, the mortality of the treated larvae and adults was recorded after 72 hours for lufenuron, and after 24 hours for dinotefuran and thiamethoxam. LC50 values for second instar larvae were 34.32, 24.91.32.9, 15.82 AI L-1 and for adults were 175.67, 289.76, 164.02 AI L-1 for dinotefuran, thiamethoxam and lufenuran, respectively. Results showed that lufenuron was the most toxic to both larvae and adults of H. postica among insecticides tested. Once the height of alfalfa field reached to about 20 cm, a single treatment was made on May 11th. All insecticides reduced the mean number of alfalfa weevil. According to results of laboratory and field experiments, lufenuron might be a more valuable chemical to adequately control H. postica with little adverse effects on environment. lufenuron may be considered as alternative chemicals to other compounds with a high potential for controlling certain pests and with less adverse effects on natural enemies

N2  - Methanolic and ethanolic extracts of Ocimum gratissimum leaves were evaluated for larvicidal activity against larva of Anopheles gambiae and non target organisms in the laboratory. Photochemical analysis of leaf showed presence of tannins, alkaloids, flavonoid, cyanogenic glycosides, cardiac glycosides and saponin. The organisms were exposed to different test concentrations ranging from 20mg/ml to 100mg/ml for 96hours. Larvae of A. gambiae were susceptible to the extracts. Ethanolic extracts of the leaf was more active with LC50 and LC90 of 60.9mg/ml and 464.4 mg/ml  respectively while the LC50 and LC90 of methanolic extracts of leaf were 73.6mg/ml and 1021mg/ml respectively. The extracts exhibited insect growth regulating activity and were found to be safe to non target organisms. Results showed that larvicidal effect of the methanolic extract can be compared to that of neem leaf extracts

N2  - The study investigated the efficacy of extracts from Datura metel, local soap and garlic in the management of Macrotermes bellicosus. The synthetic insecticide (chlorpyrifos 0.1%) and water were included in the study as controls. In the laboratory, contact toxicity was conducted using the standard method described by Mc Donald et al. (1970). The treatments (10 ml each) were applied to the thorax of worker termite and insect mortality was noted. The repellent action of the treatment was based on an area preference test described by McDonald et al. (1970) and Landani et al. (1955). The ?test area? was Whatman filter paper cut into equal halves and placed in a plastic Petri dish. One half was treated with the treatment and the other half with water (control). Four termites were released into the centre of the Petri dishes and the number of insect present on the control (NC) and treatment (NT) halves were recorded after 1hour exposure and percentage repellence (PR) values were computed. The efficacy of the treatments at managing termite populations in the field was tested on five average-sized termitaria. They were demolished and dug 40 ? 50 cm below ground level. Five litres each of the treatments was applied to a termitaria with knapsack sprayer and resurgence/rebuilding of termitaria was observed as from the 2nd day till the 90th day. The results showed that all the treatments had repellence value of between 75% - 100 % and caused 100 % mean insect mortality in the laboratory. On the field only D. metel and chlorpyrifos were effective at preventing the upsurge and rebuilding of termitaria for 90 days. Datura metel could be used as an eco-friendly botanical for the management of termites in the field

N2  - The papaya mealybug, Paracoccus marginatus, an invasive alien species found to heavily infest papaya (Carica papaya), the major host. Paracoccus marginatus (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), was first described by Williams and Granara de Willink in 1992. It is a polyphagous species native to Mexico and Other Central American Countries. It is also recorded from many countries of the Caribbean region, causing huge economic losses to papayas since 1994. Paracoccus marginatus is a small hemipteran that attacks several genera of plants (more than 40 species), including economically important fruits, vegetables and ornamentals. It potentially posed a serious threat to numerous agricultural crops. Integrated pest Management (IPM) was identified as a key component in a management strategy for the papaya mealybug. Paracoccus marginatus damaging papaya in Jammu region is reported for the first time. Besides it, the fundamental biological data of Paracoccus marginatus, its existing host plants and its distribution in India and around the world was described.

N2  - Hyblaea puera (Lepidoptera: Hyblaeidae), commonly known as teak defoliator, is recognized as the most serious pest of teak (Tectona grandis) in the area under study. Outbreaks of this insect which feeds on young tender leaves occur during the early part of the growth season, soon after the trees have put forth the new flush of leaves. The observations were recorded on the biology of the pest in Jammu under laboratory conditions. The pre-mating period of both sexes of moth was one to three days after emergence. Mating occurred during night and lasts for about an hour. A characteristic courtship behavior was exhibited by the adult moths. Pre-oviposition period was 20- 24 hours and the mean oviposition period was 6 days. It was revealed that the incubation period varies from 1.5 to 3.05 days with an average of 2.51±0.648 days. The larvae passed through five instars and total larval period varies from 15.2 to 20.15 days with an average of 17.62±1.64 days. Pupal period ranges from 6.2 to 8.4 days with an average of 7.16±0.85 days. Total life cycle varied from 21.4 to 28.15 days with an average of 24.79±2.42 days. Pest completed 7 generations in a year from June to November

N2  - Response of different silkworm breeds towards parthenogenetic development has been studied in newly developed bivoltine and polyvoltine silkworm breeds. Japanese type bivoltine silkworm breeds showed pronounced parthenogenetic developments as compared to Chinese ones. An increased tendency towards parthenogenetic development was observed in hybrids obtained from a mother moth having a high tendency of parthenogenesis. Three bivoltine breeds viz., DNB1, DNB6 and DNB7 were developed and evaluated. Evaluation was carried out through various statistical tools like analysis of combining ability, hybrid vigour and cocoon size uniformity. Androgenetic development was also induced in different silkworm breeds/hybrids. Polyvoltine hybrids exhibited higher androgenic development as compared to bivoltine hybrids. A breed with dominant cocoon colour gene was utilized as genetic marker to identify androgenic male individuals. Induction of androgenesis was performed by exposing the oviposited eggs to hot air (38 ºC) for 200 min. Repeated backcrosses were adopted utilizing androgenic males to introgress homozygosity in the breeding lines. Among six polyvoltine silkworm breeds developed through androgenesis, two breeds AGL3 and AGL5 were found promising. Two bivoltine hybrids viz., DNB1 × CSR4 and DNB7 × CSR2 and 2 polyvoltine × bivoltine hybrids viz., AGL3 × CSR2 and AGL5 × CSR2 were found promising.

N2  - 447 roosting groups of house sparrow were studied from February 2009 to April 2012 at 6 rural areas and 2 urban areas of Jammu division. The pre-roosting behaviour and roosting sequences like assembly time, time of arrival of birds at roost, sundown, duration of chirping, sunset, first call and departure time in morning in House Sparrow were studied which were found directly linked with light intensity, time of sundown, sunrise , weather condition and type of locality (urban / rural). House Sparrow were found to roosts in pure (non-communal) and mixed groups (Communal). 58.84 % groups were mixed roosters with one species, 3.93% mixed roosting with more than one species and 41.16 % groups are pure rooster. Sparrow was  found to be more communal rooster (82 %) in urban areas because of less choices of vegetation and more risk of predation while in rural areas it prefer pure roosting (61%) because of availability of spiny shrubs and low risk of predation. House sparrow used spiny shrubs and trees less than 7 ft. height as favourite roosting vegetation. The spiny vegetation gives protection from predators. In mixed roosts of rural areas, the ratio of House Sparrow to other mixed roosters was found more in number because of less competition from other species due to availability of lot of choices for roosting sites. But in mixed roosts of urban areas, the ratio was found to be less because of less availability of roosting vegetation and more competition from other mixed roosters.

N2  - The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) belonging to the family Passeridae is the most widely distributed land bird in the world. In India, it is distributed all over upto 4000 m in the Himalayas. In the recent times, its population had declined drastically in Europe and other countries of world. ln India its number has also reported decreased in many cities of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, West Bengal and coastal areas. In urban and suburban areas of Jammu, its population has been found to decrease drastically in the past 10 years. The study is carried from March 2009 to March 2013 to find out the cause of decline in these areas. The lack of nesting sites in the modern concrete houses and decrease in number of mud houses was found to be the main cause of decline. The lacking of spiny shrubs and trees less than 7 ft. height most preferred by House Sparrow as roosting sites, lack of animal diet in early stage of nestling diet and intense competition for nesting sites from birds like Common Myna, Red -rumped swallow etc. were other major causes of decline reported. Other probable causes reported are electromagnetic radiations from mobile towers, predation  and lack of water sites.

N2  - The bionomics of Aak weevil Paramecops farinosa (Wiedemann) has been studied on Calotropis procera (Ait.) R. Br. in Jammu, Reasi and Rajouri Districts of Jammu region of J & K State. This is the first report from India as well as the world. P. farinosa has been observed as a major pest of C. procera, an important medicinal plant which is grown only in restricted patches in Jammu region of J & K State.  Adults feed externally on the tender leaves and flowers whereas larvae feed internally with in the developing seed pods causing heavy damage. Mating usually occurs during night or early morning hours. Copulation lasts for 30 to 45 minutes and females oviposit in the pericarp of seed pods and lay 6 to 12 eggs per clutch. Eggs are oval with both ends rounded, creamish to dull yellow. Larvae are apodous, soft, and cylindrical with dark brown head and pass through five larval instars. Egg, larval and pupal periods is 6.20±0.66, 22.50±1.55 and18.00±1.47 respectively. The total period from egg to adult takes about 46.70±3.75 days. Adults emerge from the infested seed pods from June to November without any interruption and remain actively feeding on host plants till the beginning of next fruiting stage. The pests breed throughout the year and do not undergo winter rest. At least two generations are observed from June to November.

N2  - The arthropods are a dominant group due to his morphologic characteristics. La Pampa not only possesses a scanty knowledge of the arthropodological fauna, but also presents an expansion of the agricultural area on the natural ecosystems. As controllers of these plagues, we find the spiders and the ant. The aim of this work is to evaluate the biodiversity of spiders (araneids) and the ants (formicids), in two crops peanut and soybean located in Maisonave, North-East of La Pampa, (64º S and 35º O). Samples were carried about all over a hectare of surface from December, 2008 to March, 2009. In every plot three transects were settled separated one another by 25 meters. In each transect each pitfall was placed to a distance of 25 meters. The obtained material was preserved in alcohol to 80% and settled in the subject Biology of the Invertebrate II, Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences, of the U.N.L.Pam. The analyses were performed with Estimates. The obtained results show a dominance of the species Solenopsis saevissima in the ants (formicids); while in the spiders (araneids) the families Lycosidae and Thomisidae are the ones which present major abundance

One hundred grammes of maize grains were weighed into 250 cm<sup>3</sup> jars. The grains were seperately mixed with 1 g, 3 g and 5 g garlic powder and 5 %, 10 % and 15 % propolis extract. The treated grains were infested with 5 pairs of 1-10 day old <em>S. zeamais</em> and left for 90 days. Each treatment was replicated four times and arranged on work table in the laboratory using Complete Randomized Design. The untreated grains (control) had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher number of <em>S. zeamais</em>, % weight loss, % grain damage and % weight of grain powder. All the treated grains had 100 % adult mortality of <em>S. zeamais</em> at all treatment levels. The % grain damage, % grain weight loss, weight of grain powder and number of <em>S. zeamais </em>were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the garlic powder and propolis extract -treated maize grains compared to the untreated ones.  Propolis extract at 15 % concentration had the lowest grain weight loss followed by maize grains treated with 3 g garlic powder. Garlic powder and propolis extract could be used to control infestation in maize grains to overcome draw-backs associated with the use of synthetic insecticides.</span>

N2  - The outbreak of yellow mite, <em>Polyphagotarsonemus latus </em>population almost regularly as one of the most serious pests of jute crop (<em>Corchorus olitorius </em>L.) in Bangladesh. The experiment was conducted to ascertain the effect of weather factors on incidence and population development of yellow mite, (<em>Polyphagotarsonemus latus</em>; Acari: Tarsonemidae).The objective of this study was to determine effects of rainfall and mean temperature on the abundance and the seasonal dynamics of yellow mite stages of four jute varieties (O-9897, O-72, OM-1 and O-795). Population fluctuation at all stages of yellow mite at 7 days interval after infestation observed highest fluctuation peak for egg (117.67�24.64) at June 10, larva (87.33�4.67) at June 17, pupa (87.33�4.67) at May 6, female (35.00�5.13) at June 17 and male (11.67�1.67) at May 6 in the variety of OM-1 among others varieties under net house condition. Yellow mite stages varied significantly among varieties of jute plants at all sampling dates. All stages of the mite preferred the undersides of the leaves than its upper-sides. Among the different environmental factors mean temperature and weekly total rainfall was positively correlated with the different stages of <em>P. latus </em>population. The determination of the effects of different weather factors on population and incidence of <em>P.latus </em>in jute is essential for effective pest management. This study not only helpful in forecasting outbreaks of <em>P.latus </em>but also effective pest management strategies in formulation.

N2  - Silkworm breeds are highly unpredictable and pathogens are the main cause of diseases in silkworm rearing, diseases are more prevalent in winter and rainy seasons. The major silkworm diseases in India are grasserie, flacherie, muscardine and pebrine. Susceptibility of silkworm breeds mainly due to influence of environmental and nutritional factors. The disease r�sistance mechanism of a genotype has immense value, since the disease resistance results in stability of crop performance and increase in productivity.  Fungal diseases are recognized as muscardine or mycoses. Silkworm attacked by more than dozen genera of fungi and white muscardine caused by entomopathogenic fungi of <em>Beauveria bassiana</em>. In Karnataka, white muscardine is named as Sunnakaddi or Sunnakattu roga and Chuna-Kete in West Bengal. The Italian names Calcino, Agostino Bassi, Italian entomologist discover the name of muscardine in 1835. White muscardine disease is rampant in all sericultural areas during winter and rainy seasons, as the humidity increases with the decreases in temperature there is possibility in increase in the spread of muscardine disease in silkworm rearing. The present study was conducted systematically to screen the multivoltine and bivoltine silkworm breeds of <em>Bombyx mori</em> L. and higher dose of conidial <em>B. bassiana</em> concentration 1x10<sup>7 </sup>suspension was used for identify the  resistant and  susceptible against white muscardine disease. Out of 27 silkworm breeds, the multivoltine breed 2000H and bivoltine CSR6 exhibited relatively more resistant and susceptible breeds. The detail procedure and screening techniques, results and discussion have been dealt in the paper.</span>

N2  - The toxicity of Spinosad to different larval instars of the pink corn stem borer,<em> Sesamia cretica</em> Led. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), was evaluated under laboratory and field conditions. The impact of Spinosad on the protein content and glycogen level of larvae was also taken into consideration. Data indicated that Spinosad had toxic activity against the tested larval instar and the mortality was in the order of first instar > second instar > third instar > fourth instar > fifth instar with respective LC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.008, 0.016, 0.028, 0.044 and 0.159 ml/l after 7 days of treatment. Also, the field experiment showed high efficiency of Spinosad at the highest three concentrations down to 25% FR (0.125 m/l) against<em> S. cretica</em> larvae, which resulted in significant reduction in the number of plants containing either perforated stem or dead hearted case, number of larvae, tunnels and excavated areas inside infested plants. Regarding the biochemical parameters, results proved that the protein content and glycogen level in the treated larvae was significantly lower than that of the control at all concentrations of exposure. The highest rate of decreasing in total protein content was -54.5% for 2<sup>nd</sup> instar larvae exposed to 50% FR (0.25ml/l). Also, the decrease in glycogen level in the treated larvae was concentration-dependent and reached -55.8% to 2<sup>nd </sup>instar larvae exposure to 50% FR (0.25 ml/l.).

N2  - Endemism richness can be interpreted as the specific contribution of an area to global biodiversity. The degree of endemism for an area is often cited as a measure of the uniqueness of the fauna and consequently is important for prioritizing sites for conservation. Turkey has continental properties considering both species richness and endemism richness in terms of its covered area on the Earth. For this reason, the paper gives an updated list of Turkish Chrysomeloidea that includes a total of 925 species group taxa (897 species and 28 subspecies belonging to 108 genera of 18 subfamilies of 4 families). The endemism ratio for Turkish fauna of Cerambycoidea is 11.14% in 9 subfamilies of 3 families. Because, the family Orsonachnidae, 3 subfamilies in the family Bruchidae (Amblycerinae, Pachymerinae and Rhaebinae), 1 subfamily in the family Megalopodidae (Zeugophorinae), 4 subfamilies in the family Chrysomelidae (Donaciinae, Criocerinae, Timarchinae and Hispinae) do not include any endemic species. Consequently, Turkey can easily be interpreted as a “biodiversity hotspot” on the Earth in terms of the fauna of Cerambycoidea that is an important animal group for Turkish biodiversity in respect to species richness. However, fauna of Turkish Chrysomeloidea has a low (with respect to the closely related superfamily Cerambycoidea that has endemism ratio over 40%, but also a remarkable  endemism ratio (11.14%).

N2  - The world change in land use and crop modification has been, at the expenses of forests, pastures and swamps. Argentina pampean plains have not been an exception because of this global tendency with an agricultural border continuous advance from the east to the semiarid west. This generates a loss of biological diversity that affects a great number of organisms among which we find the ants, which play a very important role in the communities structure doing a balance between living creatures and their habitat. The aim of this work is compare the myrmecofauna associated with productive agroecosystems in the central region of Argentina, through the evaluation richness of these insects and diversity. The hypothesis of this study is to test the diversity of Formicidae in fields where little anthropogenic is greater than in agroecosystems of central Argentina. Three farms were chosen as study sites, each of them divided into two sampling sites that correspond to cultivated or natural areas. A total of 5.647 ants were collected among which three dominant species were found in all the sites:  <em>Dorymyrmex breviscapis</em>, <em>Solenopsis saevissima</em> and <em>Pheidole bergi</em>. Significant differences were observed between the agroecosystems myrmecofauna and the natural environments.</span>

N2  - Agroecosystems are populated by a great diversity and number of invertebrates that are often disturbed by agricultural practices and grazing. The arthropods are good indicators of the heterogeneity of the habitat, the biodiversity of the ecosystem and the stress conditions of the environment, therefore its use for environmental management can reduce pest invasion. The goals of this study are to describe the composition of the arthropod fauna and to analyze how this fauna are distributed throughout the phenological development in a crop of winter wheat at southwestern Buenos Aires Province. Two sampling methods were conducted: at ground level by using pit-fall traps and herbaceous level using a garden-vacuum. A total of 29608 arthropods were collected belonging to 19 orders. The most abundant order was Diptera, followed by Hemiptera, Collembola, Hymenoptera, Acarii, Coleoptera and Araneae. The abundance ofthe arthropod communityassociated with thecrop increasedin the lastphenological stagesof it. This study comprises one of the first approaches involving the study of the arthropod fauna associated with a winter wheat crop at southwestern Buenos Aires Province, and also is one of the few contributions about this topic in Argentina.</span>

N2  - <em>Stenoterommata platensis</em> is a medium-sized nemesiid spider that lives in open burrows. The biology of the Nemesiidae is almost unknown. We describe the courtship and mating of <em>S. platensis</em> for the first time based on two observed matings and add some notes about their burrows in the wild on Mart�n Garc�a Island, Argentina. All males initiated courtship by beating with the first pair of legs when contacted with the female silk from the entrance of the burrow. The copulation position achieved was similar to that of most mygalomorphs. This work constitutes preliminary observations and more data are needed to a better understanding of the reproductive biology of this species.

N2  - Spiders are one of the most abundant predatory groups in the terrestrial ecosystems as they feed on insects and some other arthropods and thus, they can play important role in pest control. There are more than 3694 genera and 40462 spider species which have been recognized all over the World, out of which about 1066 species have been reported from India. Spiders play an important role in regulating insect pests in agricultural ecosystems but in India, studies on the population and abundance of the spider assemblages in agricultural crops are limited. A preliminary studywas conducted to document the spider fauna from the agroecosystems (vegetable fields) of Pauni chak, Jammu, J & K. Pauni chak is known as the vegetable basket of Jammu District as it is just 40 kms from the Jammu city and yields a good amount of seasonal vegetables. The faunistic survey from the vegetable fields yielded 12 species under 9 generas. Araneidae was the most dominant family recording 5 species.  On species level, Cyclosa insulana was the dominant species. Orb web weavers represented 70% of the total species collected.</span>

N2  - Improvement of silkworm breeds / hybrids for higher cocoon yield is the direct and efficient way to achieve good quality raw silk. Accordingly, over the last fifty years, development of polyvoltine silkworm breeds has played a pivotal role in boosting the silk production in India particularly in three southern states <em>viz</em>., Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. In this direction, contribution of silkworm breeders of Central Sericultural Research and Training Institute CSR&TI), Mysore towards the development of promising polyvoltine silkworm breeds / hybrids is the milestone. Indigenous polyvoltine races though well acclimatized to fluctuating eco-climatic conditions, they are poor in cocoon productivity and silk quality. During the last decade, few polyvoltine silkworm breeds having higher cocoon yield coupled with better silk quality, have been developed.  Some of the polyvoltine silkworm breeds / hybrids developed at CSR&TI, Mysore for the last five decades have been compiled in one place and made it available to the scientists and students engaged in sericulture research.</span>

N2  - This study aims at putting forward the co-effects of secondary compounds on total food consumption, the amount of pupal lipid and protein, weight of pupae and development time in the last larval stage of<em> Euproctis chrysorrhoea</em>. A non-choice feeding experiment was applied with a total of 14 foods. While the total food consumption of the larvae feeding on food with tannic and gallic acid increased, the total food consumption of the larvae feeding on food with p-coumaric acid decreased. The total food consumption of the larvae feeding on food with a double concentration of gallic and p-coumaric acid increased, yet the total food consumption of the larvae feeding on food with a double concentration of tannic and p-coumaric acid decreased. While the pupal weight decreased when the food contained gallic and p-coumaric acid, it increased when the food contained tannic acid. It decreased in all double concentrations. Pupal lipit and protein amounts decreased in the food where the secondary compounds were found in triple combinations. The longest evolution time was observed in the larvae feeding on the food that contained the double combination of gallic and tannic acid.</SPAN>

Alpha-Amylase activity was determined using 4, 6-ethylidene (G7)-p-nitrophenyl-(G1)-α-D-maltoheptaoside as substrate. The most enzyme activity was observed in 6<sup>th</sup> larval stage. Male and female adults and pupas showed a minor α-amylase activity. Lumen content of 6<sup>th</sup> larval midgut showed significantly more enzyme activity in comparison with midgut tissues during circadian cycle. Starvation period non-significantly affected α-amylase activity in whole body and gut extract of 6<sup>th</sup> larval stage alimentary canel assays. Enzyme activity during embryogenesis and pupa developing period were studied and results revealed that with aging of eggs amylase activity increased but just before hatching, it started to decrease. In pupal growth period, amylase activity showed a decline manner to last period of developing days. Also the results showed that, the optimal pH for α-amylase activity in 6<sup>th</sup> larval stage of cotton bollworm was alkaline (pH 12)

Feeds namely Diet I, II, III, IV and V formed flake food, blood worm, locust, rhino beetle and flour worm, respectively. Blood worm, locust, rhino beetle, flour worm were insects, and flake food was a commercial fish food. The growth and reproductive performance were investigated based on growth parameters, gonadal development and fry production. Fish fed Diet II, IV and V had a higher specific growth rate compared to the other groups. The ovary weight of guppies fed Diet II was significantly (p<0.05) higher than those with diets I, III, IV and V. The absolute fecundity values were 35.5�0.02, 58.8�0.04, 30.8�0.03, 50.2�0.05 and 48.1�0.02, respectively for the fish fed Diet I, II, III, IV and V. The number of fry produced was also significantly higher in fish fed Diet II. Between the groups, fish fed Diet II obtained the highest mean gonad weight and gonadal somatic index. The results of the present study demonstrated that the use of such dried insects is a reliable source for commercial guppy farming and the reproductive performance of the fish increased

N2  - The aim of this study is to create a Turkish Red List of the longicorn beetles. Moreover, presence such a Red List is necessary for Turkey. Even governmental evaluations could cause some erroneous decisions due to absence such a Red List. Since, governmental evaluations at the present time are based on the works that are realized with respect to the European Red List. Furthernore, Turkey appears a continental property changeable in very short distances in terms of climatical features and field structures. So, the status of European fauna and the status of Turkish fauna are not the same. Clearly, there is no any work that subjected to create a Turkish Red List except Parts I-VII. Hence, a series work is planned with this purpose. This type of study is the eighth attempt for Turkey

N2  - The English grain aphid is regarded as one of the most important pests of small grain cereals, especially wheat varieties in many parts of the world. The pest has extended its distribution throughout the wheat fields of Iran and in particular the East Azarbaijan province. Five modern Iranian wheat varieties, namely Alamoot, Alvand, Zarrin, Sabalan and Sardari, which are the most extensively cultivated in the province, were used in laboratory screening tests for assessment of their antibiosis resistance to the aphid at the stem elongation growth stage. This work was carried out under greenhouse conditions of 24.2�4.5 <sup>0</sup>C temperature, 55.7�4.6% R.H. and 16:8 (L: D) light regime. The probable antibiosis was assessed by studying the nymphal survival rate; mean developmental time and adult fecundity (total no. of progeny/ female produced within the first 10 and 15 days of reproductive stage) calculating the relevant intrinsic rate of natural population increase (r<sub>m</sub> value). The ANOVA of the data indicated that regarding duration of nymphal development time, adult fecundity and also r<sub>m</sub> values, there were significant differences (p<0.01) between the varieties. Based on this, the highest (7.70�0.47) and lowest (5.75�0.44) mean nymphal development time was calculated on Alvand and Sabalan respectively. The greatest (59.35�2.60 & 88.15�4.81) and the least (38.30�2.20 & 58.60�3.42) numbers of progeny produced per female within the first 10 and 15 days of larviposition period was observed on Sabalan and Sardari respectively. Moreover, the highest r<sub>m</sub> value (0.4120� 0.0074 & 0.4140� 0.0073) obtained for individuals reared on Sabalan, with the lowest (0.2620 �0.0034& 0.2670�0.0025) being on Alvand. The present study indicated that at the stem elongation stage, Sabalan appeared to be more susceptible to the aphid whilst Alvand was more resistant and Sardari, Alamoot and Zarrin were regarded as intermediate among the others

N2  - Studying the digestive enzymes of true bugs is important in understanding the physiology of the digestive system and manner of injury to plants by these insects. In this study, the salivary α-amylase activity of the adults and nymphs was measured by using a special diagnostic kit and an autoanalyzer. Protein concentrations in all enzyme samples were determined by using bicinchoninic acid method and bovine serum albumin as the standard. The method of Yazdanian et al. used for removing the salivary glands under a stereomicroscope, and enzyme samples were prepared by the method of Cohen. In eggs (newly oviposited and 1- to 4-days old ones), no enzyme activity was observed. In different nymphal stages, enzyme activity in third instars (12.45 U/mg protein) had the highest mean that differed significantly from other means. Enzyme activity did not observe in enzyme samples of first instars. Age and sex of adult insects had a significant effect on enzyme activity, so that it was higher in females than males, and in 15- and 30-days old adults it was higher than those of other ages, especially in 20-days old adult females which had the highest value (44.57 U/mg protein). In addition, it found that salivary α-amylase activity in adults was correlated with their reproductive activities

N2  - The frequent surveillance of the mosquito breeding sites has been identified as one of the veritable tools towards planning effective anti-mosquito measures. This study assesses the occurrence and the distribution of the natural and artificial breeding sites of mosquitoes in the rural and urban areas of Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria. Ten different larval habitats were encountered of which bamboo stumps and block moulds constituted the most abundant breeding sites in the rural areas while discarded car batteries constituted the most important breeding sites in the urban areas.  The species encountered were <em>Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Ae. longipalpis, Ae. simpsoni, Ae. vittatus, Anopheles gambiae complex, Culex quinquefasciatus, Cx. tigripes, Eretmapodite chrysogaster, Ae. domesticus, Coquilletidia maculipennis. </em>There was no significant difference in the distribution of mosquito species in the rural and urban areas (p>0.05), but the species occurrence was significantly higher in the artificial breeding sites relative to the natural breeding sites (p<0.05). The high occurrence of the mosquito vectors in the artificial breeding sites, most importantly the discarded materials calls for the mass public health awareness on the human activities that promote the breeding of mosquito vectors in the study area</span>

N2  - Studies were carried out to determine the species composition and seasonal abundance of mosquito fauna in Lafiagi, a swampy rice growing community in Kwara State, Nigeria. Adult mosquitoes were collected weekly by both indoor and outdoor methods using human landing catches and residual spray techniques between August 2009 and July 2010. Four species of mosquitoes namely, <em>Anopheles gambiae sensu lato, Culex quinquefasciatus, Mansonia africana and Aedes aegypti</em> were caught during the study. <em>Anopheles gambiae</em> s.l accounted for the highest number of mosquitoes caught (39.61%). Though, there was no significant difference in species abundance (p>0.05), the seasonal abundance showed significant variation with more mosquitoes during the wet season than the dry season.  The preponderance of the mosquito vectors (most importantly the malaria vector) in the community signifies the need for planning effective mosquito control measures to maintain the healthy living of the residents at the study area towards ensuring food security</span>

N2  - This field study was carried out succession of insect in the Taflan at Samsun province (Turkey) in the period from June 2009 to May 2010 by using dog (<em>Canis lupus familiaris </em>L.) carcasses as a human model. Eight dog carcasses (20–35 kg) were employed in this field in four seasons. The aim of this study was to determine the forensically significant insect succession and seasonal distribution in Samsun province. </span>In our study five decomposition stages were observed (fresh, bloated, active decay, advanced decay, dry). The carcasses decomposed more rapidly in summer and autumn but carcasses decayed slowly in winter and spring. Carcasses attracted 25 species of insect in our study. During this period, a lot of insects belonging to the following orders and families were collected: Diptera: Calliphoridae, Sarcophagidae; Coloeptera: Staphylinidae, Histeridae, Dermesitidae, Cleridae, Nitidulidae, Silphidae. In spring and autumn carcasses attracted a more different community of insects than winter-placed carrion. No Coloepter species were collected in the winter. Insect fauna and its seasonal differences in Samsun on dog carcasses were reported for the first time in this study, strengthening the need of further experiments in different regions of Turkey in order to forensic practice</span>

N2  - White muscardine is a fungal disease, it is most common and more prevalence during rainy and winter seasons. Usually silkworm diseases are prevalent throughout the year in all sericultural areas/countries. Silkworm <em>Bombyx mori</em> L. are affected by major diseases, such as grasserie, flacherie, muscardine and microspordian. White muscardine disease is most dangerous, virulent in silkworm and mainly caused by entomo-pathogenic fungi of <em>Beauveria bassisana</em> also named as mycosis. This disease is highly infectious in larval and pupal stages and inflicts heavy loss to cocoon crop every year. Low temperature and high humidity plays big role for the occurrence of muscardine, fungus grows well in relatively high humidity 90 to 95% and low temperature below 25�C. The study result revealed that, diseased larvae die within four to five days of infection. Larva mummified after 24 hrs of death, the whole body covered with white fungi conidia, and survival diseased larvae spun the cocoon and dead inside due to severe/secondary infection and fail to emerge as moth. Disease is transmitted through developed germination spores by diseased larvae after its death and consequently high humidity and low temperature plays a strong role for spread of muscardine disease inside the rearing tray/bed. In the present paper study has been made to understand in relation to the white muscardine disease in silkworm and its nature of morphological symptoms role have been discussed

The ranges of biological resources including their genetic resources are renewable in nature or in similar <em>ex</em>- <em>situ </em>conservation with their proper management can fulfill human needs in larger extent. Developing and strengthening of <em>in situ </em>mechanism for seri-biodiversity conservation in the protected areas is the need of the hour. Diseases and pests are the main constrains in management for conservation of muga silkworm.. Flacherie, muscardine, uzi and yellow fly are the most common diseases and pests on muga silkworm which cause significant yield loss in the vanya silk industry. The aerial and ground spraying of bio-control insecticides like <em>Beauveria bassiana</em> and <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> to eradicate various kinds of moth caterpillars is an increasingly widespread practice throughout the world. These bio-control agents severely affect the vanya silkworms <em>ie</em>. the non target insects through different mode of transmission. Aspergilosis in muga silk moth during “Bhodia” (August) seed crop causes 35-40% loss in seed production. Therefore to understand the </span>main constrains in management for conservation of vanya silk are discussed in the study

N2  - <em>Myzus cerasi </em>(Fabricus)as a cosmopolitan species chooses plants from such families as  Cruciferae, Plantaginaceae, Rosaceae, Rubiaceae and Scrophulariaceae as hosts.  This pest species, which is widespread in our country, causes curling and  distortion of the leaves by establishing large colonies on growing shoots.  Besides, they cause the growth of black sooty fungi on account of the honeydew  they secrete. It is known that this species can transmit several viruses  including <i><em>Bean yellow mosaic virus</em></i>  (BYMV), <i><em>Celery mosaic virus</em></i> (CeMV)  and <i><em>Onion yellow dwarf virus </em></i>(OYDV)  in a non-persistent manner. In this study, it is searched the effects of  entomopathogenic fungi, [<i><em>Purpureocillium  lilacinum</em></i> TR1 (syn.: <i><em>Paecilomyces  lilacinus</em></i>)] on the black cherry aphid (BCA) adults in three conidial  suspension (10<sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>7</sup>and 10<sup>8</sup>cfu ml<sup>-1</sup>)  and at two different temperatures (15 and 25�C) in laboratory conditions. The  data for mortality was recorded after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days intervals. At the  end of the study highest effect was found at 25 �C 10<sup>8</sup>cfu ml<sup>-1</sup>.  The mortality rate were found respectively after 6 and 8 days %73,48, %83,64  and the data was remained stable after 10 days. It will be appropriate that  the results obtained from this first study performed in laboratory conditions  should also to be tried in the field conditions for the control of <i><em>M. cerasi</em></i>. It is hoped that the study  will be helpful in the control strategies of this aphid species that will be  put forward in a future time. It is seen that after having obtained hopeful  results from this study, making similar works on the other aphid species are  also necessary

N2  - Both extensive field and  laboratory observations conducted for the first time from April 2008 to  November 2011 revealed that <i><em>Aglais  cashmirensis</em></i> (Kollar) commonly called as Indian Tortoiseshell is very  commonly distributed species found in diverse habitats like agricultural land,  forests, gardens, household lawns, hilly places, open fields, orchids, parks,  roads, vegetable gardens, neglected land, etc in Kashmir Valley. Being holometabolous, this Himalayan nymphalid completed  its life cycle in 32 to 49 days in which egg stage lasted 4-5, larval  21-30, pre-pupa 1-2, pupa 4-6 and adult 2-6 days respectively The larvae were  monophagous feeding on <i><em>Urtica dioica</em></i>  (Urticacae) whereas adults were polyphagous visiting flowers of many families.  Except during winter season (December  to February), it was active from March to November within an altitudinal range  from 1200-3000m. Description on its immature stages, wing venation, flight and  distribution with distribution map is being given for the first time from the  Kashmir Valley</span>

N2  - Rearing of young age silkworms up to II moult is  called chawki rearing, which usually last up to 8 days. In sericulturally advanced  countries, young age larvae are supplied to the farmers by Silkworm Seed  Production Centres through well organized co-operative Commercial “Young  Silkworm Rearing Centres” or “Chawki Rearing Centres”. The present investigation was carried out by data obtained from the  Commercial Chawki Rearing Centres (CRCs) in Southern India comprising three  states namely Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu during 2006. The data  were analysed using budgetary method and cost concepts. Detailed study of the  economics per 100 dfls (disease free layings) revealed that the major economic  factor contributing for the total cost of production was recurring cost, which  was found to be 94.3%, 82% and 91% in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu  states respectively. Another important item was cost of chawki rearing  equipment, which was worked out to about 5.7% (Karnataka), 18% (Andhra Pradesh)  and 9% (Tamil Nadu). Cost of production, sale of chawki worms and net income  were found to be higher in Tamil Nadu than the other two states</span>

N2  - The  present study was undertaken to clarify the regulatory mechanism of <i><em>Bombyx mori</em></i> tweedle cuticular protein  gene expressed in wing discs at pre-pupal stage with special emphasis to  developmental expression and hormonal responsiveness. The tweedle cuticular  protein genes <i><em>BmorCPT2</em></i> and <i><em>BmorCPT3</em></i> were selected for the study.  The expression of<i><em> BmorCPT2 </em></i>was  observed from the W3E stage and peaked at pupation when the ecdysteroid titer  declined. After pupation suddenly expression decreased. Whereas the transcripts of <i><em>BmorCPT3</em></i> increased from the W3M stage,  peaked at W3L, and then decreased rapidly from P0 when the ecdysteroid titer  decreasing. <i><em>BmorCPT3 </em></i>was induced by  the ecdysone pulse, and its expression peaked 18h after transfer to a hormone  free medium.<i><em> BmorCPT2 </em></i>was also  induced by the ecdysone pulse, and its expression peaked 24 h after transfer to  a hormone free medium. The peak of <i><em>BmorCPT2  </em></i>expression was observed later than that of <i><em>BmorCPT3</em></i> both in vivo and in vitro. Both genes, <i><em>BmorCPT2 </em></i>and<i><em> BmorCPT3 </em></i>transcripts were not observed after the 20E pulse  treatment in the presence of cycloheximide. Transcripts of<em>BmorCPT3</em> increased by the addition  of 20E in V4 wing discs. On contrary, <i><em>BmorCPT2  </em></i>transcript was not observed after the addition of 20E in V4 wing discs  which is different from the case of <i><em>BmorCPT3</em></i>.  The expression profiles of <i><em>BmorCPT2 </em></i>are  different from those of <i><em>BmorCPT3. </em></i>The  present findings showed different regulation of tweedle cuticular protein genes  at the pre-pupal stage in wing discs of <i><em>Bombyx  mori</em></i>

N2  - The  common sunn pest (CSP) <em>Eurygaster integriceps</em> Puton is the most  important pest of wheat and barley in Iran. A few egg pararsitoid from <em>Trissolcus,  Telenomus, Ooencyrtus, etc</em>. attack CSP eggs. Often the host eggs are stored  in cold temperatures for subsequent use with negative effects on the  parasitoids which increases by time. This study focused on quantitative changes  of biostatistics including parasitism rate, emergence rate, sex ratio,  fecundity, immature development, longevity and body size of <em>Trissolcus  vassilievi</em> (Mayr) reared on host eggs stored for different periods in  5�1�C. The results revealed that all above mentioned statistics were affected  by storing with an increasing intensity by duration. Parasitism rate and sex  ratio decreased more strongly than adult emergence rate. A maximum 35% decrease  in fecundity was also observed with stronger effect in long term storages. An  increasing effort to compensate the initial lag however was observed in first  week of the reproductive life of those wasps that accessed to older eggs.  Developmental time increased by a sigmoid trend by storage time. Head capsule  width and hind tibia length as measurements of body size both decreased  suddenly in those wasps that obtained from >2 week old eggs, but the width  of the head capsule decreased more rapidly in females than males that may imply  stronger fitness loss in females. As a conclusion host eggs stored < 1 month  may use with negligible negative effects on the parasitoid efficacy, while longer  storage times may cause serious negative syndromes

N2  - The  world’s species diversity is described as 1.75 million out of the possible 12  to 100 million species and insect group comprises the largest diversity among  all living organisms with 9.50 lakh described species. Biodiversity forms a  still largely explored treasure that is severely endangered due to a huge  amount of destructive human interventions. Changes in land use, habitat  reduction and fragmentation, nutrient enrichment, and environmental stress,  caused by human beings in the form of pollutants lead to reduced biological  diversity on all levels (genes, species, and communities) and all functional  roles. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimated  that about 13 million hectares –an area roughly equivalent to the size of  Greece, of the world’s forests are cut down and converted to other land uses  every year.  The non-mulberry (vanya) silk industry is depending  primarily on the productivity of forest eco-system. The vanya silkworm germplasm have several idiotypes and wild  counterparts in nature. Due to their strong endemism, the metapopulation  structures of these wild silkworms are highly sensitive to the present  biodiversity crisis contributed by deforestation, fragmentation of forest land,  environmental pollution and climate change. The North East India is considered  as the hotspot of ser-biodiversity with diverse forest based food plants and  sericigenous insects which play a significant role in sustainable rural  livelihood and poverty alleviation in the country. Globally India is the second  largest producer of silk and contributes about 15.5 % to the total world raw  silk production and generates employment to 6.8 million rural people mostly  women folk. The present paper deals with the present status of wild silkworm  germplasm and their food plants available in North East India and maintained at  Germplasm Conservation Centre, Central Muga Eri Research & Training  Institute,  Chenijan (Jorhat). The  prospects for commercial exploitation of some perennial forest trees such  Borpat,<em> Ailanthus grandis</em> , Borkesseru, <em>Ailanthus excelsa</em> and  Maiphak, </span><em>Evodia  (Tetradium) meliaefolia</em> in eri silk sector have documented in the present study.  The realistic approaches, strategies and intervention frameworks (both short  term and long term) for conservation and commercial exploitation of vanya silkworm germplasm and their  food plants have been discussed</span>

N2  - In muga culture, high mortality of larvae occurred particularly in the  early stage of rearing to the tune of 15 to 25 %. The present paper examines the impact of  adoption of integrated chawki (1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae)  rearing technology as a strategy for improving muga cocoon production in India.  During  Jethua Crop (May-June), the cocoon yield of the farmers who adopted the  technology ranged from 4552 to 6178 per 100 disease free laying (dfl) while in  the traditional lot, it ranged from 4020 to 5490 per 100 dfl. It was observed  that increase in cocoon yield in the technology adopted lots over that of  control lot ranged from 8.07 % to 17.02 %. Similarly, during Kotia crop  (October-November), the cocoon yield of the farmers who adopted the technology  ranged from 4367 to 6215 per 100 disease free laying(dfl) while in the control  lot, it ranged from 3970  to 5624 per 100  dfl. During this crop, increase in cocoon yield of the treated lot over that of  control ranged from 6.70 % to 18.62 %.   Significant improvement in cocoon production was observed due to the  adoption of the chawki rearing technology in muga culture</span>

N2  - Botanicals  have been used traditionally as grain and legume protectants against stored  product insects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the repellent and  insecticidal activity of different solvent extracts of <i><em>Clerodendron inerme </em></i>(L.) leaf against the red flour beetle<i><em>  Tribolium castaneum </em></i>(Herbst), the lesser grain borer <i><em>Rhyzopertha dominica</em></i> (F.), and the cowpea weevil <i><em>Callosobruchus chinensis</em></i> (L.). The area  preference method and dose-mortality was used to determine repellency rate and  insecticidal activity. The average repellency of 0.02�l, 0.04�l, 0.08�l of the  methanol, petroleum ether and ethyl acetate extract concentrate per cm<sup>2</sup>  of <i><em>C. inerme </em></i>leaves totally achieved  class II, III, class IV and class V respectively at different intervals (2, 4,  8 hours) of time. The order of repellent activity was <i><em>Callosobruchus chinensis < Rhyzopertha dominica < Tribolium  castaneum. </em></i>Theconcentrate of  methanol- extract of <i><em>Clerodendron inerme</em></i>  leaves was found to be more effective than the commercial product teflubenzuron  (No: SZBB291XV) and also more effective than other solvent extracts. The order  of repellent activity was <i><em>Callosobruchus  chinensis < Rhyzopertha dominica < Tribolium castaneum. </em></i>The dose-mortality test of methanolic extracts  of <i><em>C. inerme</em></i> leaf indicates that the  LD<sub>50 </sub>(1.74 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>)and LD<sub>99 </sub>(3.01  mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) was very high in <i><em>C.  chinensis</em></i> compared to the other two beetles<i><em>.</em></i> Our result indicates that the repellent activity was dose and  extract dependent in different intervals of time and dose-mortality of the  methanolic extract varied depending on the insect species</span>

N2  - The  assessment of genetic variation is a major aspect in silkworm improvement  programmes. It distinguishes different genotypes for designing the breeding  programmes and population-genetic analysis. It also estimates the amount of  variation within genotypes and between genotypes for predicting potential  genetic gain in a breeding programme. Variations in three qualitative traits  and nine quantitative traits along with protein polymorphism were studied in  ten silkworm genotypes. The results showed significant variation (P < 0.05)  in the quantitative traits of silkworm genotypes studied. Cluster analysis  based on phenotypic variation revealed three clusters separating high, moderate  and low silk producers according to the silk producing ability of silkworms.  The results of Principle Co-ordinate analysis was in agreement with the  dendrogram. Protein profiling divided ten silkworm genotypes into two clusters.  The dendrogram deduced from phenotypic data clearly indicates the dominant role  of environment on quantitative traits. However, expression of quantitative  traits depends on the genotypes and their place of origin. The phenotypic data  depicted substantiate amount of diversity among the silkworm genotypes and  hence, these breeds can be utilized for improving the silk yielding traits

N2  - <em>Helicoverpa armigera</em> is one of the most important pests of crops, such  as cotton, cereals and vegetables. Using plant derived enzyme inhibitors in  transgenic plants is one of the safe methods in IPM programs. In this study  protease inhibitory activity of some plants seed extracts from poaceae and  fabaceae family were studied. Insects reared in controlled condition and the  last larval instars alimentary canal were used in enzymatic assays. The crude seed extracts were  subjected for ammonium sulfate precipitation. The seed extracts of six plants  were fractionated into four fractions (0-30 %, 30-50, 50-70 and 70-80%). The percentage of  inhibition to cotton bollworm midgut protease activity obtained in crude and  each protein fraction of ammonium sulfate. Proteolytic activity of midgut  enzyme extracts was evaluated using the azocasein as substrate. The  results revealed that seed extracts of <em>Phasaeolus vulgaris and Cicer  arietinum</em> are  potentially effective in inhibiting the proteolytic activity of cotton bollworm  (54.5 and 53.2% respectively). Also total extracts of <em>Triticum aestivum,  Hordeum  vuIgare,  Zea mays, </span></em>and <em>sophora alopecuroides</em> inhibited HGP activity  by 17.7, 18.74, 20.62 and 29.31% respectively. Results revealed that the F1  fraction protein of all studied plants showed less than 20% inhibitory activity  against HGP, and the F2 and F3 fraction exhibited the same inhibitory activity  in the range of 10-20% in poaceae species. The legume plants especially in F1,  F2 and F3 fractions exhibited near 15-50% inhibitory activity on HGP. In over  all, among studied plants, <em>Z. mays,</em> <em>P. vulgaris</em> and <em>C.  arietinum</em> have strong inhibitory activity in compare with others

N2  - San  Jose scale <i><em>Quadraspidiotus perniciosus</em></i>  is a key pest of apple crop in the northern states of India. An assessment on  its population density was carried out in five districts of Kashmir Valley. In  district Baramulla, the pooled mean scale population ranged from 10.29 per cm<sup>2</sup>  area to 37.32 /cm<sup>2</sup> over the course of its active period from April  to October. This population range was 10.74–36.45 scales /cm<sup>2</sup> area  in district Bandipora, 11.39–37.48 /cm<sup>2</sup> area in district Srinagar,  10.22–35.57 /cm<sup>2</sup> area in district Anantnag, and 10.14–33.72 /cm<sup>2</sup>  area in district Budgam. The efficacy of entomopathogenic fungi– <i><em>Beauveria bassiana</em></i>, <i><em>Metarhizium anisopliae</em></i> sensu lato and <i><em>Lecanicillium lecanii </em></i>at three concentrationsagainstthe pest was  examined in an experimental orchard. Mortality of the pest was monitored at  2-day intervals until 30 days after application and the maximum mortality was  used for data analysis. All three fungal pathogens caused mortality of the pest  particularly with the increase of treatment concentration. High mortality (77%)  was determined with <i><em>B. bassiana</em></i> at 15  � 10<sup>5 </sup>conidia /ml. concentration followed by <i><em>L. lecanii </em></i>at the same concentration (mortality 75%). However, <i><em>M. anisopliae</em></i> sensu lato was  significantly less effective (mortality 53–68%) among the three concentrations  tested during field trial. The results demonstrate the suitability of  entomopathogenic fungi for controlling San Jose scale

N2  - The  influence of earthworm’s environment on its biology needs to be well  understood. This study investigated the impact of sawmilling activities on the  diversity, abundance and mineral composition of the tissues of earthworm  species in Lafenwa, Sapon, Isale-Ake and Kotopo sawmills of Abeokuta (7<sup>o</sup>9’12’’N-3<sup>o</sup>19’35’’E).  The arboretum of the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta was used as  control. Earthworms were sampled in the morning hours from four random samples  of 25x25x30cm and carefully counted. Weight of the earthworms was taken and tissues  mineral composition determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. Average population of  earthworms were significantly higher (P<0.05) (140–516 earthworms/m<sup>2</sup>)  in the sawmill soils than in the soil of the control site (96 earthworms/m<sup>2</sup>).  A total of five earthworm species were identified from the study locations. Mean weight  of adult <em>E.  eugeniae</em> from Sapon (1.18g) and Kotopo (1.21g) sawmills  were significantly higher than that of the control site (0.92g). K and Na were  higher in the tissues of earthworms from Sapon sawmill. Significantly lower (P<0.05) Ca and Mg concentrations were recorded in the tissues of <em>E.  eugeniae</em> from the control site compared to those of Kotopo and Sapon  sawmills. Sawmilling activities is therefore not totally detrimental to  earthworms’ habitation

N2  - Rodents are responsible for the transmission of many human  diseases. The diseases can be viral, bacterial or rickettsial e.g. lyssavirus,  scrub typhus, plague and hantavirus. These disease can be transmitted to humans  in a number of ways including animal bite, contact with animal waste,  eating food or water contaminated by rodent waste or through parasites that use  rodents and humans as hosts e.g. fleas, mites and ticks. Presence of rodents in  and around port areas plays an important role in the transportation of rodents  and their ectoparasite from one country to another. In view of the seriousness  of the problem present study was undertaken at Chennai port area (CPT), Chennai  (India). Inside port area total 170 rodent traps were laid and 14 rodents were  trapped.  <i><em>Rattus rattus, R. norvegicus </em></i>and  <i><em>Suncus murinus</em></i> were the  species collected from port area. Two species of flea viz. <em>Xenopsylla cheopis </em>and<i><em> X. astia</em></i> were recovered  from rodents and overall flea index was recorded as 3.3.

Monthly bioassays were conducted  with all the treatments against early second instars larvae of <em>H. armigera</em>.  Results showed that the LC<sub>50</sub> values increased gradually with time in  all the cases. The talc-based wettable powder formulation packed with nitrogen  under vacuum had the lowest LC<sub>50</sub> value after 6 months of storage  under both temperature conditions. Also, the lowest LT<sub>50</sub> value was  seen in virus stored as unformulated suspension at refrigerated condition after  6 months of storage (154.3 hours), whereas, it was the highest (173.6 hours)  when the unformulated virus was stored at room temperature. The present study  revealed the compatibility of the talc-based formulation with nitrogen under  vacuum condition in both the temperatures showing storage of the formulation  could effectively delay the virus inactivation. This would be crucial to  marketing flexibility and timely supply of good quality products

This study was designed to analyze the kinetics of some  defense-related enzymes in the roots of zucchini plants after inoculation with  either one or both of Pcc and <em>M. javanica</em>. Activity of phenylalanine  ammonia-lyase (PAL), peroxidase (POX), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and catalase  (CAT) in root samples were examined in a week with one day interval beginning  from the next day following inoculation with <em>M. javanica</em>. When the  plants were inoculated with both Pcc and nematode, the activity of PAL, POX and  CAT was significantly improved during the experiment compared with other  treatments. The PPO activity in such plants was more than PPO activity in  nematode-infected plants only on the 5<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> day  after inoculation. Individual application of Pcc frequently resulted in  enhanced activity of PAL, POX and CAT compared with these enzymes activity in  control treatment.

N2  - Seven  popular Indian cassava varieties namely CO2, CO3, CO (TP) 4, H165, H226,  Mulluvadi (MVD1) and Kunguma Rose were screened for rearing of eri silkworm, <i><em>Samia cynthia ricini </em></i>Boisduval for  effective utilization in eri silk production. The variety MVD1 recorded highest  values of essential nutrients <i><em>viz.</em></i>  protein, total carbohydrate, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and total minerals  which was closely followed by H226 whereas CO2 exhibited least values. With  respect to anti- nutrients, highest content of total tannins and HCN were  recorded with the variety CO2 and it was least in MVD1. The variety MVD1  registered superior economic traits of eri silkworm followed by H226 while CO2  was noted as poor performer. All the nutrients exhibited positive correlation  with economic traits except that of larval period which was decreased with  increase in nutritional content of leaves while it was vice versa in case of  anti nutrients. The order of merit of cassava varieties suitable for ericulture  was recorded as MVD1 > H226 > CO (TP) 4 > CO3 > Kunguma Rose >  H165 > CO2

Experiments were designed on three factors, including foodstuff (3 treatments),  wrapper (4 treatments)  and the concentration of ozone mixed with 40% carbon dioxide (3 levels). The results  showed that the behavior of wheat  is different from wheat flour and rolled oats foodstuffs.  Accordingly, while the most mortality beetles in  wheat (alive) was observed in  the BOPP 40μm film (biaxially orientedpolypropylene) with low permeability, the most mortality in wheat flour and rolled  oats (non-alive) occurred in Non-woven PP (polypropylene) wrapper with high permeability.

N2  - Mango  (<i><em>Mangifera indica</em></i> L.) is known as  “king of fruits”. Several insects are known to cause significant damage to  mango and affect its productivity. One of them is <i><em>Bactrocera dorsalis</em></i> which is an important pest of mango in India. Keeping in view the medical, economical and dietary  importance of mango and damage done to it by different insect pests, work was  done to study the biology of this pest  which causes huge damage during (May to September). Adults are strong  fliers, eggs are laid in the soft skin of ripening fruits. On hatching, the  maggots bore into the fruit further and feed on soft pulp. The infested fruits  bear depressions with dark green punctures and when cut open wriggling maggots  were seen inside. Later, the affected fruits get malformed and in conjugation  with bacterial activity, fruits rot and ultimately fall down. Maggots emerge  from these fruits and pupate in the soil</span>

N2  - Family Acrididae is widely distributed in India and  members are called typical grasshoppers. Grasshoppers are the most abundant  aboveground insect found especially in dry habitat and also distributed in crop  fields. Plant feeding by grasshoppers can deplete plant biomass and damage  crops. In extreme cases herbivory can cause ecosystem damage. This can occurs  directly from disruption of habitat by loss of vegetation or indirectly through  induced erosion of soil. Members of the subfamily Tropidopolinae are purely  raminivorous but also feed on crops and cause defoliation. Two species of  grasshoppers <em>Tristria pulvinata</em>  (Uvarov,  1921) and <em>Tropidopola longicornis </em>(Fieber,  1853) of the subfamily Tropidopolinae  recorded from Uttar Pradesh, India</span>

N2  - The European corn borer is one of the most important economic pests that could find in all parts of Iran. To study the genetic diversity of O. nubilalis during summer 2013-2014 from first generation in wheat and in second generation from other hosts, 15 individuals of each sex were collected for preliminary analysis. The genomic DNA from European corn borer larvae extracted from host populations of corn, wheat, okra, barley, melon, sugar beet and cocklebur from Ardabil province of Iran using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 10 different SSR primers produced 36 polymorphic bands. Nine of the SSR primers showed high variability across the distinct populations with 100 percent polymorphism. Within populations, genetic diversity based on Nei’s gene index ranged from 0.214 to 0.600 at wheat and cocklebur in host populations, respectively. Mean and standard deviation of observed number of alleles were 3.600 and 1.265. Mean of observed hetorozygosity and gene flow for all loci were 0.0857 and 0.020, respectively. Molecular variance analysis showed significant differences within and among populations with groups variance accounted for 13.08 and 97.73, respectively. Using the un-weighted pair-group method analysis, cocklebur population grouped as unique in one cluster while the other populations grouped separately

N2  - Cutting  ants are social insects comprising two genera<i><em> Atta</em></i> and <i><em>Acromyrmex</em></i>  (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Formicidae). They have the habit of cutting and  transporting fragments of various vegetables, flowers and / or seeds to their  underground nests. These habits have become pests of cultivated areas and  natural pastures of South America, Central and North, especially eucalyptus and  pine forest plantations because they cause damage to the productivity of  plants. For their control are used agrochemicals and is currently initiating  the study of plant extracts with insecticidal properties, which must be  pre-tested. Therefore, the objective of this work was to obtain an artificial  diet that meets the metabolic requirements of ants  <i><em>A.  lobicornis</em></i> E. in the laboratory, and ensure their survival while they last  bioassays. Various diets ants were tested and concluded that SOL 24, LIQ 24,  LIQ 48, 24 and SOL SOL 48 diets are suitable for the survival of <i><em>A. lobicornis</em></i> workers during toxicity  bioassays</span>
