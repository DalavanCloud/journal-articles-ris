N2  - The relations between six hundred people interested in dragonflies and scattered over more than fifty countries throughout the Globe, are like a wide mazed network of thin blood vessels That some of these have grown to become powerful veins through which flows a rich stream of scientific information, has inspired a small group of workers to try to create a structure of wider scope – to the benefit of all involved. On October 22-23, 1971, the First European Symposium on Odonatology, held in Ghent, Belgium, has given birth to the SOCIETAS INTERNA TIONALIS ODONATOLOGICA, with the aim of perpetuating contacts among workers all over the World and promoting research by rapid diffusion of information.

N2  - Most reproductive features such as: absence of courtship, tandem intra-male sperm translocation, tandem oviposition, interactions during oviposition, and oviposition time, were essentially similar in Argia plana Calvert and Argia moesta (Hagen), studied simultaneously at a 144 m stretch of Cowan Creek in southern Oklahoma. On the other hand, sperm translocation and copulation were closer to water and briefer in moesta. Also, the two species oviposited in different substrates; plana in Nasturtium and debris, moesta only in surface Salix roots whose lower portions were used by Hetaerina americana (Fabricius) for submerged oviposition. The three species were able to occupy the same small area primarily because each used different substrates for perching and oviposition. The adaptable moesta successfully invaded the area by laying eggs in the previously unutilized surface Salix roots.

N2  - In Agrion splendens larvae, the sequence of capture has been studied in detail. During the strike, a very quick forward and backward movement of the foregut can be seen which is synchronous respectively with extension and retraction of the mask. A hydraulic mechanism for the projection of the mask is considered, assuming that the absence of thoracic and abdominal diaphragmatic muscles is compensated by the narrowness of the abdomen.

N2  - For the following reasons, C.xanthostoma (Charp.) should be considered a good species: (1) Its wing colour pattern is stable. All previously stated cases of intermediates with splendens splendens are splendens or caprai, not xanthostoma; (2) The coloured wing spot appears only a few days after emergence. In splendens, including the “intermediates”, it is present from the beginning; (3) Where both species share the same area, there is a difference in habitat selection; (4) The colour of the ventral part of the ultimate abdominal segments is yellowish in xanthostoma, whitish in splendens (HEYMER, 1971b). This is an important character in reproductive isolation, probably as important as the wing spot itself; (5) The geographical area inhabitated lies greatly outside that of C.splendens and subspecies and is closed. It is the same area as the one occupied by a number of dragonflies, the specificity of which has never been challenged and that are very characteristic of it.

N2  - The diploid chromosome number of Leptagrion macrurum (Burnt.) from the surroundings of Sao Paulo (Brasil), 2 n d = 30, is the highest ever found in a dragonfly. Coupled with the neo-XY sex determination, it indicates the secondary nature of the karyotype. In Figure 2 a tentative model of the karyotypic evolution leading to the present peculiar situation is given. The cytotaxonomic evidence seems to be in favour of an ischnurine rather than pseudagrionine affinity of the Leptagrion alliance.

N2  - , In Poland L. barbarus is known from 75 localities. On the basis of own observations combined with records from the literature, the author infers that the northern limit of its range runs along the northern frontier of Poland rather than through Czechoslovakia as suggested by AGUESSE (1968). Lestes barbarus (Fabr.) wird allgemein als streng mediterrane Art bezeichnet, und seine in den nördlichen Gebieten Mitteleuropas gefundenen Individuen gelten als Wanderer. Diese Ansicht beruht entweder auf ungenügender Kenntnis des Schrifttums oder auf mangelndem Vertrauen zu den Forschungsergebnissen früherer Odonatologen. Jedenfalls ist eine solche Ansicht unrichtig und gibt e'ne Gewähr für die Feststellung des wirklichen Verbreitungsareals dieser Art.

N2  - Aeshnid larvae respire through tracheal gills. These are located in a modified region of the hind gut, the branchial chamber, and are ventilated by muscular movements which effect a flow of water into and out of the anus. Normal ventilation is a rhythmic process, with expiration occurring first. The nature and nervous control of this and other forms of ventilation, including jet-propulsive swimming, ate analysed in terms of morphology, mechanics and neurophysiology. It has been known for some time that anisopteran dragonfly larvae respire through tracheal gills located in a modified posterior region of the alimentary canal known as the branchial chamber (AMANS, 1881; MATULA, 1911; TIL-LyARD, 1917; WALLENGREN, 1913, 1914 a, 1914 b). However, TONNER I was the first to describe different types of ventilatory movements. He istmguished normal, gulping and chewing ventilation, and in addition noted at the jet-propulsive mechanism of swimming, in which the larva ejects a current of water from its anus, would also subserve respiration. The various types of have been further analysed in recent years by HUGHES & MILL (1966), MILL (1970), MILL & HUGHES (1966), MILL & PICKARD (1972) and HJCKARD& MILL (1972).

N2  - While the author was collecting larval skins at a small pool in Linz, Austria, his eyeglasses were repeatedly attacked by a male of Aeshna cyanea. This phenomenon is considered as a special case of territorial behaviour. Am 18. August 1971, einem sonnigen Tag, um etwa 12 Uhr 30 wollte ich am Rande eines kleinen Tümpels (Fläche ca. 100 m“) in der Pleschinger Au bei Linz (Austria) Libellen-Exuvien sammeln und hatte dazu meine Brille aufgesetzt. Als ich mich anschickte, in gebückter Stellung, — meine Augenhöhe betrug dabei etwa 1-1.2 m, — Schilf und Ufer nach Larvenhänten abzusuchen, flog ein Männchen von Aeshm cyanea. das vorher in etwa 0.75 m Höhe über dem Wasserspiegel den Tümpel abgeflogen war, bis auf eine Lnlfernung von etwas über einen halben Meter von vorne an mich heran, verharrte im Rüttelflug kurz an dieser Stelle und flog dann von unten gegen ein Glas der Brille. Nach dem Aufprall am Glas umkreiste das Tier mich und den Tümpel und flog nach Verharren im Rüttelflug wie vorher erneut gegen die Brille an. Dieses Verhalten wiederholte sich etwa 5-10 Minuten lang in nahezu gleicher Art und Weise, und zwar in Abständen von vorerst etwa 10 und später etwa 20 Sekunden. Je länger das Tier die Brille attackierte, desto weniger heftig und seltener kam es mit dem Glas in Berührung. Die Libelle gab jedoch ihr sonderbares Verhalten erst auf, nachdem sie ein zweites und unmittelbar darauf ein drittes Tier derselben Art und desselben Geschlechtes jeweils sofort nach dessen Ankunft am Tümpel angegriffen, in die Flucht geschlagen und verfolgt hatte. Von diesem Zeitpunkt an flog der “Sieger” weiterhin den Tümpel ab, ohne noch ein einziges Mal von der Anwesenheit der Brille Notiz zu nehmen. Zur Zeit meiner Beobachtungen hatte das cyanea-Männchen weder die zahlreichen Zygopteren ( Lestes sponsa und Coenagrion puella) noch die etwa 6-8 Libelluliden (Sympetrum danae, S. vulgatum und S.sanguineum), die zeitweise von ihren Warten am Rande des Gewässers autgeflogen waren, beachtet.

N2  - The life history of Aeshna mixta seems to be subject to thermal conditions acting during the embryonic stage. Three aspects should be considered. 1. – Completion of embryonic diapause. An exposure of the eggs at 10°C for 10 to 15 weeks before return to 20°C must be considered as the thermal optimum for performing the diapause development. 2. — Synchronization of hatching. The minimal period of exposure to low temperatures is 15 weeks. After that time 94% of eggs hatch within 5 days. 3. – Number of larval instars. The post-embryonic development may involve 9, 10 or 11 larval Instars, each of these development types being determined ab ovo. A relatively short embryogenesis (100 days) induces hatching of larvae which develop within a rather short time (2/3 of type 9, 1/3 of type 10), whereas an about two times longer embryogenesis causes the hatching of larvae which develop slowly with a higher number of instars (4/5 of type 10,1/5 of type 11).

N2  - Average adult life span including an 11 day teneral period was 16-20 days for males and females, with a maximum of 47 days. Longevity estimates were not significantly altered by increasing the area censused for marked adults from 30 m to 1,128 m, indicating that dispersal was not affecting the estimation of longevity. Most males were territorial, many remaining in the same place up to eight days. Females were rarely found in the same place on consecutive days and their average mobility was greater than that of most males. Maximum movement between days was 122 m for females and 536 m for males. Nonterritorial males in some populations of Calopteryx are probably individuals unable to acquire territories when there are more males in an area than territory sites. In C. maculata these males quickly occupy opposition sites added to an area and become territorial at them.

Though principally araneidologist, he devoted numerous papers to the study of the distribution of dragonflies within his country. In collaboration with Mrs. FELICIA BULIMAR he produced, in 1965, the odonate volume in the well known series “Fauna Republicii Populare Romane”, an appreciated contribution to our knowledge on the Balkan dragonflies and which has served as useful basis for further study ever since. The loss of Dr. Cfrdei, who had great plans for further research on Odonata and was about to begin a study on the Central African fauna, will be certainly felt in the world of odonatologists.

N2  - A short biography of D.C. GEIJSKES is followed by a list of his scientific publications (1928-1971), a great number of which are devoted to Odonata, particularly to those of South America. It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to write about a sixty-five year old scientist of whom much can still be expected, about a creditable entomologist who has many times operated outside his own field with great success, about an odonatologist who is not only one of the greatest authorities on the neotropical dragonfly fauna, but also on the Surinam interior.

N2  - Seasonal distribution of some Indian species, which centers largely around different types of larval habitats, is discussed. Two main types of larval habitats are present in the valley, viz. the perennial streams, and seasonal monsoon ponds. The observations seem to indicate that in the species developing in perennial streams, the larval period is prolonged for some 5-8 months, while the adults are on wings for not less than 3-4 months. On the other hand, the larval period of species breeding in seasonal monsoon ponds is shortened to about 2-4 months, while their adult life span is prolonged to 8-9 months.

N2  - Larval sex-ratios were investigated in populations of Pyrrhosoma nymphula (Sulz.) and Coenagrion puella (L.) from a point when larvae were approximately half-grown until just prior to, or including adult emergence. In both species there was a very small (averaging 52.0 and 54.4% respectively) but statistically significant excess of male larvae present throughout this period of development. These results are compared with other work on Odonata sexratios. Including the present study, an excess of male larvae is reported in eight of the available records for Zygoptera, and this imbalance is statistically significant in five of the records, involving two species. Another five records for the Zygoptera show an excess of female larvae, with the imbalance being statistically significant in two cases. There is an indication that sex-ratio imbalances involving an excess of females are larger than those involving an excess of males. These results are in direct contrast to the situation in the Anisoptera, in which all twenty-one of the available records show an excess of female larvae. The reasons for the difference between Anisoptera and Zygoptera in this respect are uncertain; nor are the causes of the sex-ratio imbalances in Odonata understood.

N2  - . In Aeshnidae, the growth of the visual apparatus is controlled by two kinds of factors. Morphogenetic factors regulate interrelations occurring between the eye and the optic lobe. Humoral factors are involved in the coordination of the growth of the visual apparatus and in general, in the transformations the insect undergoes during its larval life and metamorphosis.

N2  - The discovery of three colonies of the libellulid Nesciothemis nigeriensis Gambles in the region of Zaria, Nigeria, is reported. The species was known hitherto only through the type specimen which was taken in 1961, much further south in Nigeria. The males of N. nigeriensis are strongly territorial at the waterside; females are seen only occasionally by water. The preferred habitat seems to be marshy lake margins having a good growth of emergent grasses, especially Echinochloa. Both sexes roost in tall grass, mostly away from the water. GAMBLES (1966) described a new species of Nesciothemis Longfield (Odonata: Libellulidae) from a single male specimen which he took at Agulu Lake, Awka, in East Central State, Nigeria in 1961. The species, A. nigeriensis, remained known only from the type specimen until 29 June, 1971, when we took a mature male at about 5.30 pm local time at University Farm Lake*, Samaru, Zaria in North Central State, Nigeria. This specimen was determined by Gambles. Figure 1 is a photograph of a living adult male of N. nigeriensis.

N2  - In June 1971, intense migratory activity was recorded in L. quadrimaculata L. in Belgium, France and the Netherlands. Enormous swarms gathered in the compound estuary of Zeeland. Part of them apparently moved up the river Scheldt and scattered over a large number of its tributaries in Belgium. The ultimate fate of this swarm was extinction. Compilation of literature data shows that migration in L. quadrimaculata is a cyclical event with a period of about 10 years. The phenomenon is thus related to population dynamics and should be density-dependent. There is a fundamental difference between conditions to migration (crowding, mass emergence, weather condition) and the ethological (optical interaction-synchronization) and ecological stimuli. The latter are believed to act as pacemaker to the former. The ecological mechanism postulated is, indeed, derived from a hypothetical parasite-host relationship, the most likely parasite being a trematode larva. This could produce an internal irritation, reinforcing the optical synchronization.

Determination of K"*~, Ca“"*", Mg2"*", Cl , HCO3 > and proteins in the haemolymph were made. The phylogenetically least advanced groups had a high level of Na"*” and Cl" in the blood. The restoration of haemolymph ionic balance following haemorrhage was studied in L. depressa and in Agabus sp. (Col.) at 4°C over a 10-day period. Evidence was found for rapid Na"t mobilisation and a slower replacement of K+. The levels of Ca2+ and Mg2+ were relatively stable. Homeostasis appeared to be best regulated in the spp. inhabiting stagnant water, Sympetrum sp. and Sialis sp. (Megal.). (290) DEJOUX, C„ L. LAUZANNE & C. LEVEQUE, 1971.

N2  - This study traces ovarian development from the teneral through four postteneral ages in Argia moesta. Terminal follicle size and proportions of ovarioles having specific follicle sizes distinguish these ages internally. Externally, the ages relate to color patterns and pruinescence. Asynchronous function of ovarioles, follicle resorption, and follicular relic recognition complicate use of these structures in projecting ecological parameters. No useful relations appear possible in ovariole number and follicle number per ovariole. The largely undeveloped tenerals inherit little to no fatty tissue from the larval stage drawing attention to the importance of conditions at emergence. Tandem marks and filled spermathecae identify mated females. Four post-teneral male ages exist scored by degree of pruinescence development and condition of seminal vesicles. The study recognizes geographic variability in the age-dependent changes.

Material originates from different localities in Darjeeling, India. In both species the chromosome number is 2n d = 25, n c? – 13, including a pair (bivalent) ot m-chromosomes. R. quadrimaculata is the first member of the family so far studied cytologically. The karyotypes of Epallage fatime (Charp.) and B. indica are briefly compared The former is the only other representative of Euphaeidae hitherto examined and deviates from the latter by the lack of m-chromosomes.

N2  - Two Florida dragonflies of the family Corduliidae perform their territorial patrol flights at different times of the day. Epitheca Stella (Wmsn.) flies during the middle part of the day, as is the case with other species of the genus, but E. sepia (Gloyd) is on territory from late afternoon to dusk. The two species are similar in size, appearance and structure and fly during the same season, and the temporal separation of the territorial flights may be the only reproductive isolating mechanism between them.

N2  - A migration of P. flavescens (Fabr.) was observed on the coast of Santa Catarina, Brazil, in February, 1970. The passage took place during the morning hours, with a maximum between 8 and 9 a.m. Flight intensity decreased steadily within a week. A total of approximately half a million dragonflies involved in the migration was calculated. The start of the migration was not observed and the causes of the phenomenon are unknown.

In May, in 109 pellets, 1 odon. specimen was encountered, in June 0.3 in 10 pellets, and in July 2 specimens in 57 pellets. The odon. spp. were not further identified. The figures do not seem to differ significantly from those for Diptera, while they seem lower than those for Coleoptera, and higher than those given for Lepidoptera. A comparison of the composition of adult pellets with food offered to young birds shows that Odon. and, in general, larger preys occur more often in the latter than in former.

The population exhibited a daily peak in mating and territoriality. Males actively competed for territorial sites over or near water and showed site specificity with turnover in territorial residents during the day. These defended sites served only as mating stations, not as feeding areas. The dominance of a male, defined by its ability to hold a territory at times of predictable daily peaks of mating attempts, appeared to be an age- related phenomenon. The organization of the mating system was similar to a lek, but with temporally rather than spatially related dominance of individual males. (Verbatim).

N2  - Imaginal populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans were studied by means of capture-recapture methods in Cheshire and Pembrokeshire, U.K., from 1965-1970. Age grouping of both males and females was accomplished by noting characteristic colour changes associated with the ageing process. There is some indication that the distribution of immature imagines in the colonies at Dunham, Cheshire, was partly determined by the available vegetation shelter from wind. Acorus seems to afford greater protection than Juncus. By noting the age group composition of the colonies and studying the population estimates it was found that I. elegans had bimodal emergence curves with peaks in June and July/August. The population sizes at the Dunham Ponds bore a direct relationship to the size of the pond. The total estimated season’s sizes for Ponds 1 and 2 (1965) and Pond 3 (1966) were about 2000, 4700 and 450 respectively. The sexes were about equally represented in these estimates. The populations in June 1970 at Ponds 1 and 3 were between three and five times larger than for the corresponding months in 1965 (Pond 1) and 1966 (Pond 3). It was found that I. elegans is active under a wide range of weather conditions, only winds in excess of 20 knots, heavy rain, and a day temperature of less than 15°C (especially in combination) completely suppress flight.

N2  - Imaginal populations of I. elegans were studied by means of capture-recapture methods in Cheshire and Pembrokeshire, U.K., from 1965 to 1970. Although the survival rates did not alter with time, the populations had characteristic survival rates which differed from each other. This was probably due to differential predation by birds. Survival was shown to be heavily age dependent, the heaviest losses occurring at the teneral stage. Maximum survival was 42 days for males and 50 days for females. No evidence was obtained to indicate a general movement away from water by teneral insects: many individuals stayed at the water’s edge during the maturation period. The maturation period may be as short as three days (males) or four days (females), although it is probably usually a little longer. Many individuals do not move more than 100 metres from their emergence site. A few individuals are wanderers over relatively great distances and are presumably important as founders of new colonies. In many respects (great general adaptability, activity in cool and dull weather, rapid maturation which is usually at water, persistence of females at water, and a very long copulation time) I. elegans does not conform to what seem more general zygopteran characteristics.

N2  - The genus Progomphus Selys is revised and the nomenclatural difficulties around the Progomphus versus Gomphoides problem are ironed out. Muttkowski’s name Negomphoides is discarded in favour of Gomphoides Selys, 1854. A key to the 52 species known in the adult stage is constructed, including 20 that are introduced as new, viz. Progomphus virginiae (Brazil), adaptatus (Brazil), elegans (Brazil), australis (Argentina), aberrans (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay), delicatus (Peru), amazonicus (Brazil), tibialis (Surinam), mexicanus (Mexico, Costa Rica), nervis (Peru), formalis (Ecuador, Peru), boliviensis (Bolivia), anomalus (Ecuador, Panama, Peru), abbreviatus (Colombia), incurvatus (Peru), tantillus (Bolivia), superbus (Ecuador, Venezuela), fassli (Brazil), montanus (Bolivia), and kimminsi (Argentina). Descriptive notes on most of the previously described species are offered and important details are elucidated with camera lucida drawings. Illustrations of P. polygonus are published for the first time. The male accessory genitalia of Ris’ species are described and figured. The type species of the genus, Progomphus gracilis, is redescribed and more fully characterized. A conspectus of the type status and locations is compiled. For 31 of the previously known 33 nominal species type specimens could be located. The type of Progomphus herrerae is apparently lost, while the location of that of Progomphus intricatus is doubtful. Nine lectotypes have been selected. A table summarizing the geographic ranges of single species, and distributional maps of some species groups are added.

N2  - . In A. cyanea, molting hormone and juvenile hormone control the metamorphosis of the copulatory apparatus. Two experiments have been carried out: (1) ablation of the molting glands during the first day of the last larval instar; (2) injection of a juvenile hormone mimic (farnesyl methyl ester) at various times during this instar. The arrest of molting hormone secretion stopped the development of the copulatory organ. Injection of juvenile hormone, if performed before the seventh day of the last larval instar, also inhibited this development.

N2  - Dr. PHILIP CARMAN died in Hamden, Connecticut, USA, on January 22, 1972, at the age of 80. Dr. Carman gave students of the United States Odonata two outstanding identification guides. “The Zygoptera or Damsel-Flies of Illinois” appeared in 1917 and the “Odonata or Dragonflies of Connecticut” became available in 1927. These works became standard references for United States workers and although long out-of-print, continue so. Dr. Carman was born in Lexington, Kentucky, USA, September 25, 1891. He received a B.S. degree at the University of Kentucky and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Illinois. He worked with the Experiment Station at Maryland State College (1916 – 1919) and later joined the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in 1919 remaining until his retirement in 1956. His work during these years largely involved insectborne fruit diseases and mites. Following retirement, he was curator of Odonata at the Peabody Museum, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. This period was spent enthusiastically preparing a revised edition of the Dragonflies of Connecticut and we hope to see it in published form soon. Dr. Carman’s contribution to Odonatology consists of only three titles; however, their value to United States workers will remain for many years.

N2  - An account is given of the development of odonatology in the Far East with special reference to Japan. Knowledge of dragonflies has apparently existed since very early times in these countries. Japanese nature lovers, including children, had a good knowledge of these insects and made use of them in the daily life. Modern biology in Japan began with Siebold in about 1830, and Japanese odonatology, as a modem science, dates from 1883 when SELYS-LONGCHAMPS published his “Les Odonates du Japon”. Among that of Far Eastern countries, the fauna of Japan has been worked out best; the known odonate species in Japan total 180, while, in China, there may be 100 species in the family Gomphidae alone. As shown by the Odonata in recent years, nature conservation is an urgent need in Japan. It is believed that applied entomology in China started long before the Christian era. The Chinese had a good knowledge of sericulture, apiculture and insect pests from very early times.

N2  - The relationships between colour phases, sexual maturity and age were studied, using capture-recapture, dissections and direct observations. All young individuals were found to have greenish-yellow background body colour, which darkened to brown in females and to black in males. All males had a blackish wing banding which darkened with age, although many females (about 63%) lacked it. When present, the wing band in females in brownish and in some individuals darkens with age. Full sexual maturity was recognised by the presence of spermatophores in the penis (males), or by the presence of sperm in the reproductive system (females). In males sexual maturity coincided with the development of the completely black body and heaviest wing banding. In females, sexual maturity was closely correlated with brown body colour, but no clear association could be detected between intensity of female wing banding and sexual maturity or age. The mean age of males at the onset of sexual maturity was about 11 days.

N2  - Most of the work was carried out at two lakes near to Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria. By the use of painted, dead specimens of this species, other libellulids, a gomphid and models, the species-specific recognition characters have been investigated. It seems that the proportion of dark blue and red on the abdomen and overall size are the most important characters for males. The bright yellow stripe on the dorsum of the thorax of females is probably the most important character enabling males to recognize potential mates. Natural flight movements are not important in recognition of species and sex in N. nigeriensis. By means of mark-recapture of teneral males it has been determined that the normal period of maturation away from water is 12-15 days. The whole of the maturation period of males seems to be spent in the same small area. When sexually immature, male and female are practically identical in colouring and pattern; both having a brownish thorax with a vivid yellow longitudinal stripe on the dorsum and a copper coloured (brownish-orange) abdomen. At maturity, the male is dark blue with abdominal segments 5-9 bright red; the female is brown with a dorsal yellow stripe which is retained from the immature stage. Males live for at least 49 days. Sexually mature males are highly territorial, frequently returning to the same territory day after day, but they are more variable in their choice of roosting sites. The males arrive at their territories late and leave the water early each day, even when the weather is fine. Aggressive territorial behaviour and mating have been seen at the roosting sites. N. nigeriensis is a typical ‘percher’, only flying for about 5 – 6 percent of its time at water. Emergence commences in mid-May and the last imagines are seen in late October in Zaria, their disappearance coinciding with the onset of the harmattan and dry season. It seems likely that the species is univoltine in Zaria. It is only known to occur in the greater Zaria area and in its type locality, Awka, which is 520 km to the south of Zaria. The evidence seems to suggest that it has only recently established itself in the Zaria area.

N2  - The life history of this insect consists of successive events, among which development and diapause occupy the longest duration. These processes are controlled by a series of physiological mechanisms of hormonal nature in answer to external factors (photoperiod, temperature, feeding). Although the hormonal control of the main biological processes, such as moulting, metamorphosis and diapause is known as a whole, the recent use of chemically pure hormones, or of substances which mimic their action, makes it possible to clarify numerous problems, as well as to contest some others. (I) Moulting. – Following the classical scheme, ventral glands secrete ecdysone or moulting hormone (a steroid compound) in response to a hormonal stimulus from the brain. This hormone acts on the epidermis and on other target organs involved in moulting. However, it is noteworthy that an important time interval separates the functional activity of ventral glands from the moulting hormone activity itself. Indeed, ventral glands must be extirpated within 24 hours after ecdysis if a permanent larva is to be obtained which cannot undergo moulting anymore. Only the implantation of these glands to such a larva, even after several months, allows the resumption of development, i.e. moulting and metamorphosis. On the other hand, in a normal last larval instar (duration: 25 days), moulting hormone activity can be demonstrated in the Calliphora-bioassay over an 8 day period, starting on day 16 and reaching a maximum on day 20. The requirements of this hormone are the highest just on day 20, as is shown by studies on the metabolic fate of injected radiolabelled ecdysone. Indeed, at this time the radioactivity which can be recovered from whole insects is very high after the injection, whereas at beginning of the intermoult (on day 6 for instance) injected ecdysone will be excreted rapidly. No moulting hormone activity can be detected in permanent larvae. Such larvae do not contain the factor elaborated by the ventral glands, which is perhaps of polypeptidic nature, and are unable to secrete ecdysone. The injection of chemically pure ecdysone into permanent larvae induces apolysis and secretion of a new cuticle within a very short period. Penultimate instar larvae complete a normal morphogenesis, in contrast to last instar larvae in which the growth and differentiation processes of metamorphosis cannot take place in consequence of the rapidity of both apolysis and secretion of the new cuticle. Therefore it seems that two hormonal factors are necessary to ensure a normal moulting. (2) Metamorphosis. – This phenomenon occurs only if moulting hormone is acting alone. In fact, if juvenile hormone (secreted by the corpora allata) is present in addition to moulting hormone the insects perform a typical larval moult. The removal of corpora allata being surgically impossible, their role was investigated by implanting active corpora allata into last instar larvae where these glands are normally inactive. This operation leads to a supernumerary larval moult or an intermediate form between larva and adult called adultoid. The use of a substance which mimics juvenile hormone effects, farnesyl methyl ether, makes it possible to dose accurately the juvenilizing effect and to obtain as desired (by injecting this compound to last instar larvae) adultoids which are more or less close either to a larva or to an adult. The response of larvae depends both on the dose of mimicking substance and on the time of injection. The 6th day of the last instar, after which the juvenilizing factor is unable to affect metamorphosis, corresponds to a critical period coinciding with the definitive programming of adult development. (3) Diapause. – Induction and termination of larval diapause which are subjected to photoperiod, are also under the same hormonal control as moulting. However the brain, acting as the integration site of the photoperiodic stimuli, has a considerable importance in the control of diapause. Indeed, whereas implanting active ventral glands into diapauzing larvae has no effect, an active brain is able to terminate diapause. Finally, the injection of chemically pure ecdysone into diapauzing larvae makes it possible for them to resume development. It seems, therefore, that the brain hormone is able not only to stimulate ventral glands, but also to maintain their activity until ecdysone is secreted in sufficient amounts in order to ensure the resumption of development.

N2  - Gomhus (Gomphurus) modestus Needham has often been confused with other species of the Gomphurus group. The penis is shown to be a good specific character in this group. The flagella of modestus are short, not long as in G. vastus Walsh with which Needham compared his species. The males of modestus have penes very much like G. dilatatus Rambur, but the subgenital plates of the females are most like G. lineatifrons Calvert. The brownish G. vastus from Texas is here considered the end of a clinal variation in color of this species. Similar dines are suggested for Gomphus (Stylurus) townesi Gloyd, and G. (Stylurus) plagiatus Rambur. G. flavocaudatus Walker is certainly the light end of a clinical variation in color of G. exilis Selys. The need is shown for further study of the relationship between the darker G. brimleyi Muttkowski found from North Carolina to north-western Florida and the yellower G. cavillaris Needham from central and southern Florida.

Grenoble, Domaine Universitaire, F38 Saint-Martin-d’Hères). Oviposition was studied in adult 99 kept in captivity during several weeks. If their wings are arrested, they can survive for over 80 days, depositing about 1600 eggs during this period. The egg membranes (chorion, vitelline membrane) were studied with the electron microscope as well as in histological sections. A description is given of the micropylar system. At the anterior pole of the egg the endochorionic membrane is thickened under the hemispheric outgrowth of the exochorion. This structure is compared to the situation in the representatives of the genera Anax and Aeshna. Hemianax appears intermediary between the two. The Aeshna egg is considered to represent a primitive type. (539) HYNES, H.B.N., 1971. Zonation of the invertebrate fauna in a West Indian stream. Hydrobiologia 38 (1): 1-8. – (Dept. Biol, Univ.

N2  - Quantitative studies have been carried out on the larvae of P. nymphula and E. cyathigerum in a small artificial moorland pond. A double-cylinder toothed sampler appeared to give good quantitative results but it was not a rapid method of collecting and it removed part of the environment. A net caught a higher proportion of larger than of smaller larvae. Artificial vegetation harboured more specimens per unit area than real vegetation. A patch of Potamogeton natans is the main egg-laying site of Pyrrhosoma. Colonization of mats of artificial Littorella indicate passive dispersal soon after hatching. There is little wandering later in life. Development can be completed in one year, but generally requires two. It takes three years when larvae are numerous. Numbers, particularly at the end of a generation, did not vary much from 1955 to 1965, although predation by trout was heavy in the second half of the period and absent during the first. In 1966 and thereafter larvae have been scarcer, probably because there has been much less rooted vegetation.

N2  - The respiratory epithelium of the rectal tracheal gills of Aeshna cyanea (Muller) larvae is of cellular construction throughout the entire length. It contains numerous tracheoles surrounded by a thin cytoplasmic sheath of tracheoblasts and extracellularly located in deep invaginations of the epithelial cells. The tracheoles run nearly parallel to each other in radial orientation, they are, however, irregularly distributed with respect to their distance from each other and from the cuticle. This arrangement of the tracheoles presumably provides optimum conditions for oxygen uptake.

In C. marginipes this perch is defended by the abdomen-raising display. The territory is established by the patrolling, chase and elaborate confrontation-flash displays. The function of the territory, the increasing complexity of these displays, and the bivalency of the flash display, are discussed. Mating occurs outside the territory, and copulation is of long duration. Oviposition is endophytic, in tandem and outside the territory; it occurs at the water’s surface.

N2  - The generic name Gomphoides (Selys, 1854), by virtue of the adjectival endings of the species originally and subsequently included in the genus is to be regarded as of the feminine gender, not masculine as stated in my recent paper (1973, Occ. Papers, Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan No. 668). Phyllogomphoides (Belle, 1970), as indicated by the species included, is masculine. In attempting to change the endings of specific names to agree with the supposed gender of a generic name, one may find himself rather than the original describer to be in error. This is the embarrassing position in which I find myself in regard to the gender for the genus Gomphoides as given in my recent paper (GLOYD, 1973:3). After its publication, I learned from Professor H.D. Cameron of the Greek & Latin and Classical Studies Department, University of Michigan, that Greek words ending in -oides in their Latin transliteration form can be either masculine, feminine, or neuter.

The author prefers not to publish the exact topographic position of the new locality, for fear the species may become extinct because of intense collecting as has been the case at Zwingseel. It is suggested that C. hylas extended its range into Central Europe only in the course of the last few decades, and that new records may be expected from other subalpine lakes, particularly also from the Carpathians.

Similarities and differences between both genera are pointed out. Oligolestes is ranked among the Sieblosiidae, which family is removed from the Anisozygoptera and included in the Lestinoidea (sensu Fraser). Hypotheses about functional adaptations in the wings of this group and other dragonflies are developed. Illustrations show the complete possible wing venation of Sieblosia (schematized) and the true wing nervation of Oligolestes.

N2  - The observations were carried out at two localities in Ethiopia. When two a meet, one of them may fly off, or the two may face each other when flying with small vertical hops. When a <5 approaches a perched 9 it flies very slowly or hovers, its body swinging laterally, sometimes describing a semicircle around the 9. The 9 may refuse pairing by spreading out its wings. The copula was observed once and lasted about half a minute.

N2  - OBSERVACIONES SOBRE LA CÓPULA Y LA OVIPOSICIÓN DE TRES LIBELLULIDAE EN IGUAZÚ, PROV. MISIONES, ARGENTINA (ANISOPTERA). – La cópula de Orthemis ferruginea (Fabr.) se realiza en vuelo, dura menos de un minuto. La hembra sola pone los huevos tocando la superficie del agua con la punta del abdomen. El macho la "guarda” volando sobre ella. La cópula de Pantala flavescens (Fabr.) se queda volando durante más de 5 minutos a una altura de 2-4 metros. Ponen los huevos en posición de tándem. La postura de Tramea cophysa Hag. difiere de la de T. onusta Hag. (NEEDHAM & HEYWOOD, 1929) como sigue: El tándem busca volando un lugar apropriado. Los animales se separan, la hembra baja una vez tocando el agua con el abdomen. Cuando vuelve hasta el macho este coge su tórax con las patas, dobla el abdomen y asegura los apéndices en la cabeza de la hembra. Después el tándem sale buscando otro lugar.

N2  - (719) BOSSAGLIA, R. & A. HAMMACHER, 1971. Mazzucotelli. Wasmuth, Tubingen. 123 pp. (Text in Ital., Germ, and Engl.). – (Author’s address unknown). The book is a richly illustrated review of the work of the well known Italian "ornamental smith”, Alessandro Mazzucotelli (born: December 30, 1865, Milan; deceased: January 29, 1938, Milan). The maximum physical presence, bordering on the monstrous, he achieved in certain portrayals of insects, particularly because of the alarming impression made by their exaggerate dimensions. As to the technical procedure we have the artist’s own explanation of the execution of the dragonflies on his famous lamp (reproduced here on fig. 42 A): "The body is formed with a flat piece of iron modelled when hot, the large eyes, wings and legs are welded on. The wings are cut in sheet iron”. (720) BULIMAR, F., 1971. Neue Beiträge zum Studium der Odonaten-Larven (Ordn. Odonata, CI. Insecta) aus der Moldau.

N2  - Volcanic events during the middle Pleistocene blocked the Jordan Rift at the frontier between Israel and the Lebanon. South of it, in the Hula Lake area, four endemic subspecies of dragonflies evolved, presumably during and after the Wiirm. They are all subspecies to Ethiopian species. North of the barrier evolved Calopteryx hyalina Martin, a taxon of uncertain status. The two endemic Anisoptera of Lake Hula (Rhyothemis semihyalina syriaca Selys and Urothemis edwardsi hulae ssp.n.) are probably extinct now, while the Zygoptera (Pseudagrion torridum hulae Dumont and P. sublacteum mortoni Ris & Schmidt) are still in existence.

N2  - In the vicinity of the Guadalquivir Marismas, Spain, M. genei is univoltine. The flight season extends from May to August, with a maximum of emergence in June. Hatching lasts about 40 min and takes place in the afternoon (85% between 12.00 and 16.00 hrs), at 20°C approximately. The sex-ratio at emergence during May-June determined on 1285 individuals was not statistically différent from 1, with a very small excess of 99, but the ratio varies significantly from month to month: 46.9% d in May, 53.3% dd in June. A possible explanation for the delay in emergence in the d population might be sought in a smaller compétitive capacity of the dd at the beginning of the hatching period under conditions of high larval density and food scarcity. Like emergence, reproductive activity begins at a late hour, about noon. Compared to the known Gomphidae, M. genei does not exhibit any ethological peculiarities. Its success in the Marismas zone seems closely related to the conservation of aquatic habitats with open sandy bottoms.

N2  - A short biography of CYNTHIA E. LONGFIELD, Honorary Associate of the British Museum (Nat. Hist.), is followed by an appreciation of her odonatological work and by a list of her odonatological publications (1929-1974). CYNTHIA LONGFIELD was bom in Ireland on August 16th, 1896. She commenced working at the British Museum (Natural History) as a ’’Visitor” in 1927. Before this, she had made a start to her scientific career by joining the St. George Expedition to the Pacific, 1924-25, accompanying and encouraged by Miss Evelyn CHEESMAN. Without that lady’s august chaperonage, her family would never have allowed her to take part in what was for those days such an unheard of escapade for a young lady as an expedition to the Islands of the South Seas. The expedition visited Coiba, Cocos Island, the Galapagos, the Marquesas, the Tuamotu Archipelago, and Tahiti. She soon excited the admiration of all, not only by her entomological zeal but also by her practical seamanship. On her return in 1925 she was elected to the Royal Entomological Society of London, and quickly became a recognised expert on the Odonata. She was elected to the Council of the Society from 1932-34, and served as a member of the subcommittee on the Neuropteroid groups of the Committee on Generic Nomenclature. Their report, ’’The Generic Names of the British Odonata, with a check-list of species” was published in 1935. She was elected to the Council again from 1946-48, and served as Vice-President 1947-48.

N2  - The hourly feeding activity rhythm of A. imperator has been studied. The larvae were placed in individual dishes with 10 standard sized chironomid larvae each: eaten prey were replaced every hour. In the laboratory, under natural lighting, the number of hourly captures, the number of larvae having eaten, and the number of prey captured per larva, all reached a first maximum in the evening at dusk, and a second maximum early morning, at dawn. Data from observations in February, June and October were qualitatively comparable but differed quantitatively. Excretion does not seem to be influenced by nycthemeral variations. Variations of light intensity seem to influence the nycthemeral distribution of feeding activity of larvae provided with plenty of prey; in continuous light no significant variations of feeding activity could be observed.

No adults of either species were found to be active at air temperatures below 14°C, and they became most active at the highest temperatures and in sunny areas. There was a distinct difference in oviposition sites of the two species. X. zealandica oviposited in aquatic and semi-aquatic plants at and just below water level, depositing one egg at a time; A. colensonis laid eggs in groups inside the stems of plants in or near water, about one metre above it. Mature males patrolled these oviposition areas; X. zealandica males tended to form swarming groups when populations became dense. However, A. colensonis males never swarmed; they probably regulated their numbers by territorial behaviour.

N2  - In the study of the osmoregulation of the haemolymph of the larvae of A. cyanea, two kinds of experiments are used. The organisms not being fed during the course of the experiments, the effect of starvation is investigated. Changes of the haemolymph osmotic pressure as a function of the time spent in the experimental media, and the relation between the osmotic pressure of the internal and external media are measured. In all experiments the concentration of free amino acids is determined. The results indicate that free amino acids compensate for changes in osmotic pressure of the haemolymph.

N2  - Ovipositing behaviour in Odonata may be classified according to any of three independent sets of criteria, based on Central European species; the system may be worked out in more detail when tropical species are also considered. (1) Criteria based on functional morphology. Relationships between the ovipositing apparatus, the shape and the form of the eggs and the ways of depositing eggs: (a) a mobile, completely orthopteroid ovipositor for depositing longish eggs into relatively solid substrates, mostly plant tissue (ovipositor with or without supporting ridges on the lateral gonapophyses or on stemite 10), (b) ovipositor developed as a long rigid tube, used to deposit roundish eggs into a soft, mud-like substrate (Cordulegaster, analogous structures also in other Libelluloidea), (c) ovipositor reduced to vaginal valves or completely reduced; often with analogous transformations of the stemites for throwing or stripping off of roundish eggs (mostly one by one, rarely in batches) and for fixation during copulation (Le. species specific). – (2) Criteria based on functional ethology. Degree of protection provided by the last copulation partner to the ovipositing 9 from approaches of other dd: (a) solitary oviposition (hidden or after period of main activity of dd), (b) with watching d (outside territory, or in d territory), (c) opposition in tandem under guidance of d (in sitting position or in flight). – (3) Criteria based on ecology. Horizontal and vertical differentiation of the opposition site (in the case of opposition in flight, of the site where the majority of eggs land) within the biotope. – This tentative classification is strictly functional (based on analogies) and does not pretend to have any implications concerning the evolution of ovipositing behaPour. The latter should be analyzed by using entirely different principles, based on homologies.

Odon.), collected over a 3 yrs period for Lake Modewarre, Australia, are presented and discussed with particular reference to a recent chemical and faunistic study of a number of other more highly saline lakes in the same general region. Emphasis is placed on the common volcanic origin, chemical similarities, and in particular the faunistic affinities of Lake Modewarre and the nearby ’Corangamite series’ of lakes included in the above mentioned study. A gradual fall-off in concurrence of faunal elements (most of which are of fresh-water affinities) with increasing salinity in Lake Modewarre and the various lakes of the ’Corangamite series’ is noted, and it is concluded that any clear division of the lakes in this area into ’fresh’ or ’saline’ environments based upon faunistic criteria would be artificial.

N2  - A short biography and appreciation of odonatological work of B.F. BELYSHEV, the most prolific living soviet odonatologist, are followed by a list of new taxa he described in the order and by his odonatological bibliography (1951-1974, 1975 partim). Most of his work is devoted to fauna, biology, taxonomy and geography of palearctic Asia, but it includes also several noteworthy contributions on the geography of the World dragonfly fauna. We consider it a special privilege to have the opportunity to write a few lines on our esteemed colleague and friend, whose work of many decades has not only set an inspiring example to young workers, but will remain a solid basis for further research on dragonflies of palearctic Asia and their geography elsewhere. His broad biological knowledge and interests, and his deep love of Nature, together with his thorough approach of scientific problems and with his warm and unassuming way of communicating with colleagues, made him one of the prominent personalities in the odonatological world. His original and daring views on some of the most intriguing puzzles of holarctic insect geography and faunal history opened up new fields of research.

N2  - – S. villosum Ris, 1911 has been described from a single subadult 9 of uncertain origin, but probably from Chile and, until recently, has not been found again. Its status (possible conspecificity with S. illotum [Hagen, 1861]) was, therefore, unclear. Examination of fresh material from Chile has now shown that, on the basis of morphological criteria, S. villosum and S. illotum are distinct, closely related species. They differ in colour of the legs, shape of abdomen, presence or absence of transverse carina on segment 4, structure of d appendages, wing colour, and average number of antenodal crossveins in the forewing, whereas d and 9 genitalia are rather similar. The distribution areas of the two species do not overlap; 5. villosum is restricted to S. Chile (and thus represents another endemic species to this region), whereas S. illotum is recorded from N. Chile and is widespread in other parts of South and North America.

N2  - E. boreale has a flight period extending from the beginning of June to the end of August. Females were captured during mating and allowed to lay their eggs (endophytic oviposition) under laboratory conditions. Large quantities of eggs were placed at the following experimental temperatures: 15°, 17.5°, 20°, 22.5°, 25°, 27.5° and 30°C. The equation of the development of eggs in relation to temperature was fitted to transformed data by the method of multiple regression and finally expressed in a theoretical form, as suggested by PRADHAN (1946, Proc. natn. Inst. Sci. India 12: 385-404). A developmental index, the ’’optimal temperature of development”, the ’’developmental threshold” and a ’’developmental-hatching threshold” are defined and analysed. The ecological significance of these entities is stressed.

N2  - The territorial behaviour of A. imperator was studied using a marking technique at a small pond in central Italy. The 66 hold the whole pond or a definite part of it, patrolling above the water and fighting against other 66, until they are displaced or leave spontaneously. The time spent by a 6 on his territory ranges between less than 1 min. and 93 min. and shows a general trend to decrease in successive days with decreasing crowding. 66 may change territory inside the pond, but some of them exhibit a preference for some part of the pond. This form of spacing pattern is compared with other ones which have recently been described in other species of dragonfly.

Attempts by later authors to distinguish them by colour and pattern have only led to confusion. The species have now been reconsidered in the light of field observations on colour changes during maturation, and distinguishing characters looked for in the shape and venation of the wings. The original type-specimens have been reexamined in hopes of establishing with which of the species occurring in the field they correspond.

N2  - The effects of diet, quantity of food, and complete starvation on larval development of P. l. lucia were investigated in the laboratory. Groups of larvae were fed on 4 diets: copepods and cladocerans, ostracods, ephemeropteran larvae, and a combination of the 3, These types of food affected the duration of larval development which was 35.4, 46.6, 42.4 and 37.3 days respectively. It did not affect the total length of larvae in each instar. In experiments on the effect of quantity of food on larval development, groups of larvae were supplied with a "standard diet”, 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 of the standard. The resulting larval developmental periods, 40,0, 57.2, 76.4 and 118.5 days respectively, showed that quantity of food has a great effect on duration of development but not on total lengths of each larval instar. Experiments with total starvation, beginning at various instars, showed that development and moulting could occur in the early instars without feeding. However, this ability was lost at VI instar, although larvae could live for considerable periods before dying. The ecological significance of these 3 groups of experiments is discussed.

Since 1934 1 have been closely involved with the Odonata nomenclature. In that year the Royal Entomological Society of London appointed a committee of six eminent British entomologists to prepare lists of specific names to be fixed as genotypes of genera of British insects. They delegated, to small sub-committees, the duty of discharging this task for the particular Orders or groups of Orders. They made the rules and principles that they asked us to adopt. They also selected the members of the different sub-committees.

N2  - Recent unprecedented changes in agricultural practices have caused the loss of numerous aquatic habitats throughout the British lowlands. On the other hand, water supply schemes and increased gravel and clay extraction have produced many new water bodies. The effects of these activities on the British odonate fauna are discussed. Since 1950, Coenagrion scitulum (Ramò.), C. armatum (Charp.) and Oxygastra curtisi (Dale) have almost certainly become extinct. Populations of Lestes dryas Kirby, Aeshna isosceles (Mull.) and Sympetrum sanguineum (Mull.) have become much reduced; the first two are now very rare insects. Orthetrum cancellatum (L.) and Aeshna mixta Latr. appear to be increasing. – National Nature Reserves in Britain are selected as representatives of habitat types rather than to protect particular species, nevertheless 32 out of the 41 species breeding regularly in 1950 now occur in these reserves. 3 other species are protected in reserves managed by voluntary conservation bodies and 2 others in the state-owned New Forest. – The scheduling of the Hampshire locality of O. curtisi as a ’’Site of Special Scientific Interest” failed to prevent its extinction through the pollution of its habitat. – The value of several nature reserves for dragonflies has been increased by making new ponds. Populations of local species such as Leucorrhinia dubia (Vander L.), and S. sanguineum have been increased, and Coenagrion mercuriale (Charp.) was encouraged to colonise a reserve where it was previously absent by these means. – The Nature Conservancy Council is undertaking experiments with the aim of reintroducing species into the Fens which have become extinct there in recent years.

N2  - The main observations were carried out on imaginal populations of E. cyathigerum at Dunham Park, Cheshire. The capture-recapture method using unique marking was extensively employed, as well as direct observations. – Tenerals moved away from water during the maturation process. Most individuals marked had completed their maturation and had returned to water. Males at water were always cerulean blue with black markings, but females showed a great variation in ground colour. The form of the emergence and population curve and the long flying season strongly suggest that it is a summer species. Two population peaks, in June and July, were observed: the second peak was the larger of the two and was temporally dispersed suggesting that a large proportion of the larval population overwintered in the antepenultimate or younger instars. The Enallagma population at Pond 3 was almost extinct in June 1970, whereas a total estimated population of about 500 was present in the 1966 season. The highest steady density counts ranged from 16.8 to 47.8 insects per 100 metres of shore line at Dunham, but an exceptional value of 363 per 100 metres was recorded at Pen Ponds, Surrey, in 1967, It is suggested that physiological condition is more important in controlling numbers at water than male intra-specific interactions. Post-maturation mortality is probably nearly random with respect to age, but the marking process seemed to result in an abnormally high rate of egress in the first day after initial capture. The mean length of life for males at water was about 12 days and the maximum observed survival was 39 days. Most male individuals of E. cyathigerum show a greater mobility within the colony area than males of Ischnura elegans.

Occasional preflight neuromuscular activity and wing vibrations are considered as warm-up behaviour. Flight begins with a downstroke, and typical calopterygoid wing coordination is established in the first wingbeat cycle: the hindwings lead in downstroke, and the forewings lead in upstroke.

N2  - Agrion macrogaster Selys from Jamaica has been placed in the genera Nehalennia, Leptobasis, and Telebasis. In 1960 the author reared it from bromeliads in Jamaica and found the larva so unique that the new genus Diceratobasis Kennedy (1920, Ohio J. Sci. 21: 83-88) was accepted for it. Christiansen (1947, Psyche 54: 256-262) described a new genus and species, Phylolestes ethelae, from Haiti and suggested it might belong to the Synlestidae, with its nearest relative in Africa. Larvae which the author collected in 1960 proved him correct. The larvae of both species are herein described.

N2  - During spring 1975, dragonflies were collected in various localities in the Western (Atlantic) Sahara. Great faunal heterogeneity was found while moving from North to South. The Moroccan Sahara has a fauna which does not differ from that of North Atlantic Morocco; the fauna of Rio de Oro is very poor, but has even now been insufficiently "sampled”; the fauna of Mauretania is purely Ethiopian, but almost all species known from that country (ten out of twelve) also occur in Morocco and Algeria. Analysis of these dragonfly faunas and a comparison with other aquatic groups, confirm the theory that the boundary between the F.thiopian and Palaearctic domains runs through the desert, somewhere around the latitude of the Tropic of Cancer. It is also concluded that the expansion of the Ethiopian fauna, following the Eocene emergence of the Sahara, must have been more important than that of the Palaearctic fauna, since many Ethiopian elements still occur along the shores of the Mediterranean, but no Palaearctic species is yet known which has succeeded in establishing itself south of the Tropic of Cancer.

N2  - The behavior – of unpaired males and pairs of Chromagrion conditum (Hagen) was studied at Highlands, N.C. between June 18 and July 10, 1975. Population size (maximum 14d/73m of shoreline) and recoveries (35%d, 9%9) of marked individuals were both low. Maximum activity was between 1100 and 1300 hours. Unlike nearly all coenagrionids, unaccompanied males held their wings outspread at an average angle between the front wings of 77 degrees. Male interactions, primarily with Enallagma hageni (Walsh), were only 46% successful; the male conditum often vacated a perch without defensive activity or turned aside in flight when hageni was encountered. Most males cruised for long periods, not always as a result of male interactions and apparently not in search of females. Because of much cruising and little success in interactions, most conditum males failed to secure a territory or even a perch favorable for mating. Courtship or display did not occur. Intra male sperm translocation in tandem (X = 65 sec) and then copulation (X = 36 min) followed seizure of the perched female. After copulation, pairs averaged 67 min in tandem but spent approximately half of this time in exploratory activity. Oviposition was in the typical Coenagrion position, the sexes constantly in tandem, the male upright. Neither sex ever completely submerged. Eighty percent of the average 36 min effective oviposition was in Gratiola, Ludwigia, and horizontal Juncus. Since eggs were deposited at a rate of 5.5/min, a complement of 200 for each sequence would be expected. Eggs hatched after 21 days at ambient temperature of 21°C.

In Tibetan, like in South-East Asia, the dragonfly names appear emotionally neutral; the dragonfly is considered neither a lovable nor a frightening creature. This is at variance with the expressions in the Ear East (China, Japan), where the dragonfly is generally respected and admired, while in European cultural areas its appellations often incur a superstitious dislike.

N2  - Earlier we compared an Aphylla male from Sao Paulo, Brazil, deposited in the Selys collection in Brussels, with the nominate A. producta SELYS, 1854, and it became apparent that our specimen differed from the latter by having a much longer tenth abdominal segment (BELLE, 1970). Recently another such male was taken in Argentina but, curiously enough, it proved to be a gynandromorphic specimen. The present record of gynandromorphism js the first for the Gomphidae and the first for South American dragonflies in general (cf. GLOYD, 1971, 1975). The gynandrous male is of symmetrical physique and resembles a nonfunctional hermaphrodite. The departure from male characteristics is conspicuous by the presence of imperfectly formed female genitalia, while all other male structures are normal.

N2  - It is well known that some lestids of astatic waters can oviposit in dried up ponds, and that in certain areas lestids are not uniformly spread over all available ponds. These observations were confirmed for /,. barbarus at Castel Porziano (Rome, Italy). The working hypothesis to explain this was that each single-pond population, after an out-and-return flight, might breed at its own pond. A marking-release-recapture method was used on 337 immature imagoes of 2 single-pond populations, and on 12 teneral specimens emerged in the laboratory. Each pond was chosen close to ecologically similar ones in order to give the insects the opportunity to breed at a site other than that they had emerged from. No marked individuals were ever found breeding at other ponds than those they were coming from. It would seem, therefore, that in spite of a 2 months prereproductive period, single-pond populations do not undergo dispersion. It is suggested that oviposition at the original breeding site might have the advantage of guaranteeing the survival of the larvae, provided the pond has a suitable annual cycle, while a dispersion behaviour of the imagoes might lead to loss of eggs laid at unsuitable ponds.

The relative abundance of 19 species before and after 5 July was noted, with 6 species present in the dry season and increasing in numbers in the wet season, 5 species present and increasing only in the wet season, 4 species remaining at the same population level, and 3 species present in the dry season but decreasing as the wet season progressed. Erythrodiplax funerea (Hag.) was present in the forest in the dry season, rapidly gathered at newly formed temporary pools for a few days, then decreased in abundance. Twenty-six species of anisoptera were collected in the vicinity of Mazatlan. Data on behaviour, coloration, and egg hatching times that seem especially noteworthy are given. The known range of Libellula gaigei Gloyd is extended 990 km to the northwest.

N2  - The life histories of Lestes vigilax Hagen, L. disjunctus australis Walker, and Archilestes grandis (Rambur), were studied in small, artificial ponds in western North Carolina. All three species were univoltine, but there were pronounced differences in their life cycles. L. vigilax overwintered as larvae in the F-3 and smaller instars, and emerged from late June to early August. The emergence consisted of larvae that hatched following a short egg stage the previous summer, overwintered, and emerged approximately one year after hatching. L. disjunctus apparently passed the winter in the egg, and hatching occurred the following spring. Larval development was completed in about two months, and emergence occurred from late July to early September. The larval development of A. grandis was similar to that of L. disjunctus, and emergence occurred from about mid-August to late September. A. grandis overwintered either in the egg stage or in very early larval instars. The emergence periods of all three species were temporally separated to a degree, a factor that is probably important in reducing competition in areas of coexistence.

N2  - The effects of photoperiod and temperature on the rate of larval development in L. dubia were investigated on a population in S. Sweden. In the field, life-cycle duration was generally 3 years. Eleven combinations of photoperiod and temperature were tested experimentally. The growth of later larval instars (except the final one) was retarded at LD 13:11 at all temperatures (15°, 20° and 25°C), while LD 19.3:4.7 and LL produced a higher growth rate which was positively correlated with temperature. Experiments performed at 20°C and LD 16:8 and 17.7:6.3 produced different results at different times of the year. A very weak long-day-induced delay occurred in the penultimate instar. The larvae spent their last winter in the final instar. When this instar was reached in constant or decreasing day-lengths, the subsequent development was retarded. During the first third of the instar, the degree of the retardation strongly increased with photoperiod in the interval LD 13:11 to 19.3:4.7 and the difference between long- and short-day responses increased with temperature from 15° to 25°C. The degree of developmental arrest in a certain photoperiod was also dependent on previous changes in photoperiod. During the middle period of the instar, development was extremely slow in most groups. The last part of the final instar was of short duration and was unaffected by light conditions. These final-instar reactions are most probably instrumental in achieving a high degree of synchronization in an advanced stage within the instar by retarding the most advanced larvae more strongly than less advanced ones. In the summer (late June, July) long days retard the development in the final instar more than in earlier instars, later on (late Aug., Sept.) short days retard mid-instar development much more than early-instar development, causing an accumulation of larvae in early midinstar. Temperature affects the effectiveness of the mechanism. The latest larvae to reach the final instar (mid-Sept.) are slowed down by low temperatures and hibernate in early intermoult stages. An increase in day-length during the final (or late penultimate) instar could stimulate development and rapidly lead to emergence. This happened in spring, when previous exposure to low temperatures supported this reaction. The advanced starting position within the final instar is considered to be an important contribution to the earliness of the emergence (early June).

N2  - Children of Banda Neira Island, Indonesia, catch adult Anax guttatus (Burm.) by waving sticks to which a white coconut flower or ball of cotton wool is attached, thus utilizing the insect’s response to a specific visual stimulus. Dragonflies of the species Anax guttatus (Burm.) are caught by an unusual method by children on the Indonesian island of Banda Neira. The children use thin half-metre long sticks of the kind used in coconut matting. On the end of a stick a white coconut flower or ball of cotton wool is tied. The method for catching a dragonfly is to vibrate the stick, and point it toward a dragonfly, following its flight path. Often a dragonfly is attracted to the wobbling white object and lands on it, grasping it firmly. Usually children pick the dragonflies off their sticks and tether them to strings. Most commonly dragonflies are seen at dawn or dusk, and it is at these times that children catch them.

Mus., Nagai Park, Higashinagai-cho, Higashisumiyoshiku, Osaka, 546, JA). A classification of the complicated forms of the Japanese Mnais is proposed. These are considered to belong to 2 distinct spp., M. strigata and M. nawai. The latter has orange-winged 66 and lightly orange-winged 99, the larvae possess longer lateral gills, with pointed tips. M. strigata, on the other hand, is characterized by several forms of 66 and hyaline-winged 99, with larvae having shorter lateral gills, with rounded tips. It is divided into 6 races. The 66 of 5 of these (Tohoku, Bohsoh, Nankai, Saikai and Chugoku) appear in coloured- and hyaline-winged forms, while the 66 of the Setouchi race are hyaline winged only. The range of the Setouchi race is almost equal to that of M. nawai, and coincides with the area covered in the Pliocene by the huge Ko-setonaikai Lake (or inland sea). (Cf. also OA No. 1298).

N2  - The original descriptions of Aeschna charpentieri Kolenati, 1846 and Cordulegaster insignis Schneider, 1845 are analysed. It is found that both refer to the same species and that, therefore, the former name is a junior synonym of the latter. Later, the name C. charpentieri was applied erroneously to a taxon that should correctly be named C. pictus Selys, 1854. L. de Selys I.ongchamps himself was largely responsible for this nomenclatorial confusion, wanting to preserve as many names as possible. An examination of the Cordulegaster-fauna of the type locality area of A. charpentieri shows that the local form of C. insignis, C.i. lagodechicus Barteneff, 1930, is subspecifically distinct from C.i. insignis. This subspecies seems to extend from the Caucasus along the Pontic Alps to the Bulgarian and Roumanian Black Sea coasts. It is the same insect as C.i. montandoni St. Quentin, 1971. The cotrect name for this taxon is C. insignis charpentieri (Kolenati, 1846).

N2  - Roosting behaviour was studied in P. l. lucia and A. panorpoides inflatum between October, 1972 and March, 1974. The roosting postures of the two species were described and compared with their normal perching postures at water. Measurements of the bearings of the insects during roosting indicated that there were no orientational preferences. The dragonflies roosted within the same locality but were not restricted to definite plants. The duration of roosting was slightly longer than the night hours at Ibadan, Nigeria, for all months of the year. It was concluded that light intensity was the overriding factor initiating roosting and the first flight of the day.

N2  - The life histories of E. hageni and E. aspersum were studied in small ponds near Highlands in western North Carolina, United States. Both species overwintered as larvae short of the final instar, E. hageni in instars F-6 to 1-2 and E. aspersum in instars F-8 to F-l. The life cycle of E. hageni was completely univoltine with an early, relatively synchronized emergence. Although E. aspersum was primarily univoltine, about 8% of the new-year class was bivoltine, completing development and emerging within a single season. Fmergence was temporally dispersed, but there was a distinct peak in early summer. The temporal separation of life cycle events is probably significant in enabling the two species to coexist.

Save for O. j. internum none of the species has been previously studied cytologically. I. cyanea is characterized by an extremely large autosome pair (bivalent). The karyotype of A. comes is similar to that of Bayadera indica (Sel.), but differs considerably from the complement of the more ’’primitive” member of the family, Epallage fatime (Charp.). Neallogaster sp. is the first cordulegasteride species lacking definitely the m-chromosomes. The latter and Drepanosticta sp. are new to the Nepalese fauna.

N2  - In O. chrysis 8 groups of neurosecretory cells are present in the brain: 2 medial and 2 lateral groups in the protocerebrum, 2 ventral groups in the tritocerebral lobes and 2 optic groups in the optic lobes. The cerebral neurosecretory cells are classified as AI-, A 2-, B- and C cells. A1 cells are present in the medial groups of the ultimate instar larva and in the adult, while A2 cells are confined to the medial and lateral groups of the larval stage. The B- and C cells occur in all groups of the larval and adult dragonflies. The axons of neurosecretory cells of all the groups form distinct neurosecretory pathways inside the brain. Only a single pair of nerves, the nervi corporis cardiaci, emerges out of the brain and each of them enters the corpus cardiacum on its own side. In the larva as well as in the adult the corpora cardiaca mainly function as storage organs for cerebral neurosecretory material and, secondarily, may also produce their own hormone. The corpora allata are composed of a large number of cells and sometimes they appear as syncytial structures. Cerebral neurosecretory material is never found in the corpora allata or along with any of the nerves of these glands.

N2  - A short biography of A. ERIC GARDNER (bom: May 22, 1913; died: Feb. 11, 1976, Banstead, England; travelling representative for a firm making window blinds, and well-known entomologist) is followed by a list of his odonatological publications (1949-1968), most of which are devoted to the European fauna, and many of which describe the developmental stages of British species. On February 11, 1976 A.E. GARDNER died in his sleep at Banstead, Surrey, after an active, happy life from which both entomology and entomologists benefited greatly. He was a recognized authority on the British Coleoptera, Orthoptera and Odonata; he served as Editor and Assistant Editor of the Entomologist’s Gazette and as Curator of the collections of the British Entomological and Natural History Society (of which he was an Honorary Life Member); and he provided a rich source of encouragement and advice for other entomologists. Throughout his working life he was employed as a travelling representative of Dean’s Blinds of Putney, a job which (as he once remarked) gave him ’’plenty of scope for entomology”. (An entry in his appointment book for a summer’s day often showed the name and address of a client, coupled with the name of a dragonfly and the location of a nearby habitat in which it was likely to be ovipositing!) Among those who were privileged to know Eric Gardner personally, he will be remembered also for his cheerful disposition, infectious enthusiasm and generous nature: he was a delightful person, and his many friends regarded him with affection and respect.

(With German s.). – (Author's recent address unknown, in the paper it is given as: Dept. Zool., Makerere Univ., Kampala. Uganda). Quantitative and qualitative changes in the individual taxa of the bottom fauna were followed in the Volta man-made lake, Ghana (largest artificial lake in Africa; alt.: 84 m, length: 380 km, depth: 80 m, surface; 8000 km2) over the filling period 1965-1968. The changes in the individual invertebrate taxa during this period are considered in relation to the changing environmental factors, such as oxygen content, substratum, degree of exposure to waves, and establishment of littoral aquatic macrophytes. >Vhile the ecology of chironomids and the ephemeropteran and chaoborid larvae is discussed in detail, the larval Odon. are but briefly considered. Anisoptera were more abundant than Zygoptera. In order of their abundance the following Zygoptera were found at the sampling station of Ampem: Pseudagrion massaicum, Pseudagrion sp., Ischnura senegalensis. P. massaicum was also collected at Dodi. The presence of the zygopteran larvae seems to be related to the abundance of aquatic plants, especially Ceratophyllum, as found during observations of the fauna of aquatic plants at Akosombo, another station on the lake (cf. T. Petr, 1968. Population changes in aquatic invertebrates living on two water plants in a tropical man-made lake. Hydrobiologia 32; 449-485). Anisopteran larvae usually appeared as single specimens, preferring the shallows down to 3 m depth, with a maximum at 10 m. The commonest sp. was Parazyxomma flavicans, collected at all stations except Akosombo. Brachythemis leucosticta and Trithemis sp. were found at Ampem in shallows rich in aquaticweeds. The latter was also present in shallows in the north of Yeji.

All the adults of the 3 spp. used in the study emerged from an inner water cage within the outdoor enclosure. All the U. assignata individuals died within 6 days (66 4.36 ± 1.50, 99 4.46 i 1.41 days) of emergence. The life span of P. l. lucia individuals ranged from 1 to 52 days (66 15.81 ± 12.67, 99 17.85 ± 20.08 days), while in A. p. inflatum, longevity ranged from 1 to 61 days (66 26.30 ± 19.93, 99 26.80 ± 19.54 days). The results obtained for the 2 latter spp. are comparable to the durations recorded for marked individuals of the same species used for territoriality study in the field.

N2  - H. ephippiger migrated along the Atlantic coast of Senegal and Mauretania in January 1976. An analysis of the movement is made, and its causes and consequences are discussed. It is suggested that specimens found in Iceland and the British Isles are more likely to have come from West Africa, moving with the air current between the Agores and Iceland, than from the Mediterranean. Swarms seen in Italy, because of the period of their appearance, must, conversely, have come from the steppes of North Africa. T. basilaris was seen in high numbers in Dakar, Senegal in January 1976, and a dense migratory swarm was observed in March 1976 along the River Niger near Segou, Mali. Possible relations with the migratory behaviour of Libellula quadrimaculata L. are discussed.

N2  - A study of the food of the damselfly larvae of a temporary tropical pond reveals that the dietary ingredients become more diversified with the size of the larvae. In general, it is difficult to speak of a clear food preference in terms of particle size. The kind of prey captured by the larvae is only partly determined by the size of the larvae and of the prey. The ease in capturing and eating a prey item may result in a preference for smaller prey (chydorid Cladocera) when apparently more attractive bigger prey (midge larvae) are also available.

Ictinogomphus rapax (Ramb.), Acanthagyna dravida (Lieft.), Crocothemis servilia servilia (Drury), Rhyothemis variegata variegata (L.), Urothemis signata signata (Ramb.), Sympetrum hypomelas (Sel.), Ceriagrion coromandelianum (Ramb.), Pseudagrion microcephalum (Ramb.) were noted in the outskirts of Calcutta during Aug. 1975 – Oct. 1976. Most (121) of them were T. tillarga, followed by B. contaminata (28), P. flavescens (3), C. s. servilia, I. rapax, A. dravida, C. coromandelianum (2 each), P. microcephalum, S. hypomelas, U. s. signata and R. v. variegata (1 each). Among all species 127 were males, only 37 were females. The majority of the individuals had head- or head-thoracic injuries, some had legs, wings and abdomen missing or damaged. 9 injured and 4 uninjured individuals, picked up alive, died later. 3 dead specimens showed no sign of external injury. Bird predation has been suspected as an important cause of injury/injuries in the specimens, while the intact individuals probably suffered natural deaths.

N2  - Following a cardial infarction, Dr. ER WIN JÖRG, Director of the ’’Landessammlungen für Naturkunde” ( Karlsruhe, German Federal Republic), passed away in the midst of his work, on Friday, February 10, 1977. The participants of the Second International Symposium of Odonatology will remember this gentleman who invited us into his Museum, spoke the warm introductory words at the Symposium, and to whom we owe a great deal of the success of our 1973 meeting. Dr. Jörg was born on January 10, 1917, in Frickingen near Überlingen, on the Bodensee. He studied at the Universities of Freiburg and Göttingen, and was a well known paleontologist. Of particular importance are his studies on the fauna of the Upper Tertiary lake of Höwenegg, and on the Triassic fish remains near Karlsruhe.

The growth of the laboratory reared larvae is compared to that of larvae caught in the field; this gives an evaluation of the efficiency of our rearing technique. Finally, an allometric study underlines the existence of two distinct growth phases in the life-cycle of this species.

N2  - EXTINCT AND ENDANGERED DRAGONFLY SPECIES IN THE GERMAN FEDERAL REPUBLIC – The odon. fauna of the GFR can be divided into the following categories, based on the extent to which they are threatened with extinction: (A) 9 immigrant spp. (10% of 80), which are not considered here, and (B) 71 autochtonous spp., subdivided as (1) 22 widely distributed spp. (28%) that may still be considered to have a secure status, though often the number of their biotopes decreases strongly, – (2) 16 endangered spp. (20%), – (3) 24 heavily threatened spp. (30%), — (4) 7 spp. on the verge of extinction (9%), and — (5) 2 spp. that have disappeared completely in the past 50 yrs. Particularly endangered are the spp. occurring in running water and in unpolluted lakes and moors, since these biotypes, with a. few exceptions, have been or are being rapidly changed, polluted or destroyed. The following high priority measures are suggested: (1) intensivation of theinventarisation of the fauna of those biotopes that are still reasonably intact (in order to obtain more extensive, up-to-date data), and (2) selective conservation of particularly threatened biotopes.

Save for minor details, it is essentially similar to that recorded in other members of the family. Courtship is well marked and the 66 demonstrate ’’territorialism” over small, shaded streams. Copulation lasts 3-4 min and is performed perching oij vegetation or exposed rocks near the stream. Oviposition is endophytic and the eggs are laid by unattended 99 in submerged vegetation. They are cylindric, covered by a thin, gelatinous investment.

N2  - Three types of growth pattern in the odonate antenna are described. These differ from each other in the order in which the unique division (A) of the apical segment, and the 3 successive divisions (B) of the basal segment of the flagellum take place during larval development. These types correspond to higher taxa of the Order, viz (1) the B.B.B.A type is found in the Coenagrionidae, Petaluridae and Aeshnidae; (2) the B.A.B.B type in Cordulidae and primitive Libellulidae; (3) the B.B.A.B. type in higher forms of Libellulidae, with a transitional type between (2) and (3) in some sympetrine species. In this respect the Order can be divided into 2 groups: Zygoptera-Petaluridae- Aeshnidae on one hand, Corduliidae-Libellulidae on the other.

N2  - Data were obtained from a laboratory rearing which allowed the study of each larva individually, from hatching to emergence, in a controlled environment. These were used to analyse variation occurring in larval growth. Three different growth patterns in E. vernale were observed, each characterized by a particular number of instats (i.e. 12, 13 and 14 instars). Five variables were considered for this study: the head width and the lengths of the mentum, the metathoracic femora, the dorsal gill and the mesothoracic wingpads. By means of principal component analysis, size variation (first principal axis of each covariance matrix of larval dimensions) is compared to shape variation (described in the other principal axes); the correspondence of principal axes with identifiable trends of variation is stressed. The relative importance of size and shape variation during development is analysed for each growth pattern observed. A mechanism by which different growth patterns are initiated is suggested and allometry equations are discussed accordingly. The adaptative value of this mechanism is indicated.

N2  - The variations in food intake have been studied by monthly analyses of the faecal pellets (Sept. 1973 – Sept. 1974). The average number of recognizable prey decreases from June through Dec., then increases. Quantitatively, prey intake appears density-dependent. In the pond under study (Brittany, France) larval Ephemeroptera, Zygoptera (Coenagrion), Heteroptera (Corixidae) and Trichoptera are the relatively more abundant groups, though there are considerable fluctuations in this respect. The remains of prey occurring in faecal pellets show that Anax larvae attack mostly larval Ephemeroptera, Zygoptera, Trichoptera (Phryganea), chironomids, and adult and larval Plea (Heteroptera). These groups, as well as larval Libellulidae and Nymphulea (Lepidoptera), seem to be positively selected. Molluscs, Hydracarina, Crustacea, some aquatic Heteroptera (inch Naucoris and Notonecta), and larval and adult Coleoptera, on the other hand, seem to be avoided. Other groups are preyed upon more or less proportionally to their density. F’actors affecting food intake (relative abundance, size, habits, habitats, stimulative value of potential prey, intra- and interspecific competition) are discussed.

N2  - The total free amino acid concentration in the haemolymph is similar with a very narrow range of variation in the different larval instars as well as in the imago. The basic amino acids are found in higher quantities in the early larval instars and they decrease in the later instars to reach their minimum values in the imago. The reverse is the case with the acidic amino acids. The sulphurcontaining amino acids are totally absent in the adults while they are present in the larvae.

N2  - According to personal information from a former member of the Dalai Lama’s Cabinet, known as ”a recognized authority on the flora and fauna of Tibet”, the Tibetan dragonfly name, bla.ma.ma.ni, as discussed in ODONATOLOGICA 6 (1977): 71-73, refers to the dragonfly’s habit to stand still in the air, thus resembling the stick or the hand of a Tibetan lama, explaining a detail on the Tibetan painted scroll, thangka. The text of the Tibetan original letter and its English translation are reproduced. Through the mediation of Mr. GYATSO TSHERING, Director of the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives, Dharmsala, India, we have received an interesting comment on the above mentioned previously unpublished expression, as discussed in ODONATOLOGICA 6 (2): 71-73; 1977. The author of the comment is Mr. J. TARING, former member of the Dalai Lama’s Cabinet, now living in Rajpur, Uttar Pradesh, India. According to information given by Mr. G. Tshering, Mr. J. Taring is ”a recognized authority on the flora and fauna of Tibet”. Since Mr. Taring’s letter, dated September 7, 1977, furnishes essential additional information to that presented in the said publication, we have requested Mr. Taring for permission to publish his original letter along with its English translation. The former is given in Figure 1, and the translation of the relevant text runs as follows: ... As far as I know there is only one kind of dragonfly in Tibet (Lhasa – 12000 ft.). It is yellow in colour and is only seen during summer, usually after the rains set in. They are known as ”lamamani” because they move about the air like a lamamani’s hand, stick or rod points at the thangka, while relating and chanting the story painted on it. Lamamanis fly about in the air usually above swamps, catching mosquitoes, and they can stand still like a helicopter, or like a lamamani keeps his stick still while explaining a particular detail on the thangka..

N2  - The choice of territory is mainly conditioned by the presence of suitable opposition sites. Its size ranges from 10 to 50 m along the bank, depending on population density. The duration of territory occupation fluctuates between 1 and 15 days. The majority of <5<5 occupy territories for a single day only, some individuals, however, show a strong attachment towards a once occupied area. At temperatures above 26° C 66 prefer to perch on branches, at lower temperatures they sit on stones. The average longevity amounts to 25 days. The longest life span recorded was 60 days (6). The breeding behaviour is described in detail. Copulation and opposition always take place in the 6 territory. During opposition the 9 is guarded by the 6.

N2  - A short biography of JOHN S. ARMSTRONG (born: June 9, 1892, North Allerton, Yorkshire, England; died: Feb. 7, 1977, Taupo, New Zealand; surgeon, general medical practitioner and well-known entomologist) is followed by a list of his odonatological publications (1958-1978), all of which are devoted to the New Zealand fauna. During his long, varied and productive life J.S. ARMSTRONG had witnessed great changes, particularly in the natural communities of plants and animals for which he had such a close affection. The rapidity and extent of these changes must have been further accentuated for him because he himself was the custodian of a family tradition in natural history (a collection of insects he bequeathed to the War Memorial Museum in Auckland before his death had been assembled by four generations of his family, beginning in 1810). He was a man of wide ability, and for many years played an active and leading role in community affairs in Taupo. He saw, and helped to guide, great changes there also during a period when the town’s population increased more than an hundredfold. In his approach to scientific and human problems John Armstrong was very much an interdisciplinary man; accordingly this account will lack balance in so far as it must necessarily be confined to activities related to his contributions to our knowledge of Odonata.

N2  - A short biography and appreciation of work of E.J. KORMONDY are followed by his odonatological bibliography (1955-1969). Most of his dragonfly work is devoted to the fauna of the New World. Of particular importance are his contributions on the systeraatics of Tetragoneuria, and on odonate territoriality, dispersal, and seasonal dynamics. Bom in Beacon, New York (June 10, 1926), EDWARD J. KORMONDY gravitated to little Tusculum College in Tennessee for his undergraduate education. He majored in biology and earned his B.S. degree in 1950. His research activities in the biology of the Odonata began while he was still an undergraduate student and he continued to study the group for a number of years. From Tusculum he went immediately to the University of Michigan where he earned the M.S. degree in 1951. At the University of Michigan he served as Teaching Fellow in Zoology from 1952 to 1955, and, 1955-195 7, and Curator of Insects, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, 1956-1957. In 1957 he joined the faculty of Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio, as Assistant Professor of Zoology. He continued his research on the Odonata with the earlier emphasis on distributional, faunistic, taxonomic, and systematic studies gradually shifting toward the ecology and behavior of the group. Territoriality, swarming and local movement, seasonal regulation and population dynamics were the subjects of his later studies and publications on this group of organisms.

It is hypothesized that the inconspicuous clappings observed in d<5 of Coenagrionidae and Lestidae serve as generalized territorial declarations to competitors, but that the more conspicuous clappings in both sexes of Calopteryx serve an additional, more specialized function, that of communication between members of a pair declaring their presence to each other.

N2  - Most Odonata probably exert some control over their body temperature. Such behaviour is favored by the high, variable temperature of their terrestrial habitat and by the fact that dragonflies are relatively large insects and thus exchange heat with the environment comparatively slowly. Different species may thermoregulate behaviorally by controlling the external heat load or physiologically by altering the amount of heat generated by or dissipated from the thoracic muscles. The former method is characteristic of perchers, which are usually in a situation that permits considerable modulation of intercepted solar radiation, mostly by postural adjustments. There is also evidence that some species may perch more frequently in the shade when ambient temperature is high. Fliers, by contrast, have little opportunity to control intercepted solar radiation but continually generate large amounts of heat during flight. They may alter their rate of heat loss by controlling haemolymph flow from the thorax or their rate of heat gain by changing the proportion of gliding vs. flapping flight. Some species combine behavioral and physiological modes of regulation. Adaptive geographic, seasonal, and inter-habitat variation occurs in the responses of dragonflies to temperature. Voluntary avoidance of high temperature seems most closely adapted to the thermal environment. Temperature responses and thermoregulatory ability also vary with age and sex. The effects of temperature on the activity patterns of Odonata and the adaptive significance of thermoregulation have yet to be rigorously demonstrated in most cases.

N2  - Eggs of E. cynosura were cultured under natural and controlled conditions to determine both the diel periodicity in hatching and whether photoperiod and fluctuating temperature act as environmental cues. 150 egg masses were examined under 10 environmental conditions: 3 pretreatment photoperiods, 3 posttreatment photoperiods, 2 temperature regimes, and a natural control. Hatchlings were enumerated and removed from the cultures 6 times each day. The data were transformed to percent hatch for 2- and 3-factor analyses of variance. A diel periodicity under both the natural and 12L:12D photoperiods was evidenced by hatching peaks (80-86 percent of the hatch) immediately after the onset of darkness. Under constant light and constant darkness no peak was obtained because of the large variations in hatching throughout the day. Eggs transferred to constant light or constant dark after 8 days of development under 12L:12D (eye spots present) exhibited no peak. This is evidence that the diel periodicity is not endogenously controlled. Exogenous control is evidenced by the difference in time of hatching peaks between natural and 12L:12D photoperiods (that is, a peak between 1800 and 1815 CDT for 12L: 12D vs. a peak between 2045 and 2100 CDT for natural photoperiod). These times encompass the onset of darkness which triggered an immediate hatching response. Temperature fluctuation does not appear to cue hatching.

N2  - Lake Anna is a recent impoundment of the North Anna River in Virginia, USA. As part of a comprehensive ecological assessment the odonates were studied for 2 years prior to impoundment and 3 years following impoundment. Lake Anna was colonized immediately by odonates during the first summer after the river was impounded. After impoundment there was an initial reduction in the number of species present, but the diversity of odonates increased in subsequent years. The species composition of odonates in the reservoir was also quite different from that of the previous riverine ecosystem. Several obligate rheophilic species disappeared the first year after impoundment, but the reservoir was colonized by an early facultative or ’’pioneer” species. In succeeding years several additional or late facultative species became abundant, and several limnophilic species colonized the reservoir in significant numbers. From a review of the autecology of the species involved it appears that several physical factors determine the success of odonates during transition from a lotic to a lentic ecosystem: rate of flow, vegetation, and bottom composition.

N2  - Using fresh plant material at simulated oviposition sites, egg deposition rates for C. maculata females were found to average 7-10 eggs/min for four common plant species. Significant differences in mean duration of oviposition were found among females ovipositing: 1) alone (2.4 min), 2) while guarded by a mate (13.4 min), and 3) while guarded by a non-mate (9.8 min). Maximum duration of oviposition per day was 75 min (525-750 eggs) and over a 17 day period was 181 min (1,267-1,810 eggs). Females mated on about one half of the days present in the study area and up to five times (x = 2.04) on a single day. The adaptive significance of post-copulatory guarding is discussed.

N2  - The genus includes approx. 30 spp. The largest number of these occur in southern Asia and in Africa, 4 are known from America and 2 from Europe, while in Australia the representatives occur in the northern part of the continent only. The majority of spp. have either a very local or a very extensive range. The original (Paleocene) territory of the genus (southern Asia – southern Europe and northern Africa – southern North America) has been split up by continental drift in the Neocene, giving rise to 3 apparent focal regions, viz. Eastern Asiatic, Euro-African and American. It is stressed that the pattern of the dispersal of Anax is similar to that of the zygopteran Enallagma.

N2  - P. niloticum sp. n. (d holotype: Giohar, Somalia) is described and figured. It occurs in the Nile valley and in the Horn of Africa. P. acaciae has been confused with this sp. by Ris (partim), Andres and Carfi. Nielsen and Fraser confused acaciae with a widespread sp., now widely known as P. whellani Pinhey. However, this is by 1 yr a junior synonym of P. hamoni Fraser, 1955, as shown by a re-examination of the holotype. The latter occurs throughout the Ethiopian region, and has been found once in Libya, within limits of the Palearctic area. The distribution of P. acaciae is redefined as South and South- East Africa.

N2  - Observations were carried out at Hoshioki in Hokkaido, Japan; 1974-1977. Male mating and feeding activities continue from 7:00 to 18:00, while opposition is restricted to 15:00-19:00. Influences of weather conditions are analyzed. Flight is inhibited by a temperature lower than 12°C. Pre-mating activity of males is suppressed by a temperature lower than 16°C. The reproductive period continues from early June to mid July, with a peak of activities in mid June. The mechanisms and adaptive values of these bionomic features are discussed.

N2  - A mark-recapture study of the 2 spp. was performed at Del Puerto Cyn., 120 km SSE of San Francisco, Calif., USA, and analyzed by the Jolly and Manly and Parr methods. Movements for dd of both spp. tended to be local. Recapture data for 99 were sparse, probably due to their greater movements. Morisita’s dispersion index for both sexes of both spp. showed the following sequence, from most to least contagious distribution: E. cyathigerum 99, E. cyathigerum dd, A. vivida 99, A. vivida dd. These differences were due to the greater preference of E. cyathigerum for water sites. Female E. cyathigerum showed a 1:3 ratio of blue to brown-olive morphs, but there appeared to be no assortative mate selection by dd. A significantly higher percentage of 99 was taken in tandem or copula with unmarked dd than marked ones, suggesting that mated 99 entered the water sites already in tandem or copula. Male E. cyathigerum and A. vivida lived an average of 4.68 and 3.02 days, respectively. The Enallagma life span estimate agrees well with reported estimates for other Enallagma spp.; but that of A. vivida is considerably shorter than for reported estimates for other Argia spp.

N2  - The observations were carried out at 2 localities in Nigeria. The dd defend territories, maintained on a temporary basis. The number of days on which individuals visited water varied from 1-14 (mean 5.33). The territory length amounted to 1.5-2.0 m (between 09.00-10.30 hrs), and 0.50-0.75 m (later in the day). The territories were defended for 842 min. Sperm transfer was not observed after a d had secured a 9. Copulation ranged between 3.9-6.8 sec. Both sexes mated more than once daily. After copulation the partners were resting either separately or, infrequently, in tandem (0.0-106.7 sec). Oviposition is complex and lasted for 20.9-160.3 sec (mean 74.7). The perching plants provided suitable oviposition sites.

N2  - The use of radioactive salt solutions in ligation experiments has revealed that the larvae of both Zygoptera and Anisoptera absorb Na+ and CF ions through the rectum from highly hypo-osmotic concentrations. In Zygoptera, there are 3, in Anisoptera up to about 500 epithelial pads in the rectum which show fine structural features of transporting epithelia. Rectal ventilation provides contact of these epithelia to the external medium from where the ions are absorbed. The results of histochemical chloride precipitation in conjunction with X-ray analysis, autoradiography, and liquid scintillation counting suggest that these pads, termed rectal chloride epithelia, are the sites specialized for ion uptake. Activities of Na/K- and HCOj-ATPase are biochemically demonstrated in homogenates of the rectum of Aeshna cyanea. The highest activities of both enzymes are found in the membrane fraction. Long-term acclimatization of larvae to different environmental salinities results in different sizes of the chloride epithelia and concomitant changes of ATPase activity. The significant increase in epithelial size and activities of the transport ATPases in highly hypo-osmotic, nearly salt-free medium is consistent with the enhanced osmoregulatory activity required under these conditions.

N2  - A computer model was constructed using the bioenergetics data of J.H. LAWTON ( Hydrobiologia 36 1970: 33-52; J. anim. Ecol. 39 1970: 669-684, 40 1971: 395-423 ,Freshwat. Biol. 1 1971: 99-111) on Pyrrhosoma nymphula. Model predictions of the growth of an individual dragonfly were compared to Lawton’s data on length to test the model. Comparisons were also made between model predictions and field, literature, and laboratory data for Deep Creek, Oneida County, Idaho, USA, dragonflies, specifically Argia vivida, to test the generality of the model. Initially the model equations could not reproduce Lawton’s data, but when production and consumption were reduced in the winter months (temperature < 7°C), the results were within a mean 10% error of Lawton’s original data. Predictions for growth over the complete life cycle were also made with a starting date and initial length as inputs. Laboratory experiments with A. vivida, done as part of this study, provided data for tests of the model’s ability to make precise short-term predictions. In all but one case presented here, the predictions were statistically different from the observed even when equations specifically for A. vivida were used. However, the model as used for Lawton’s data did compare well with the field data for the whole life cycle of A. vivida. Finally, comparisons were made between P. nymphula, A. vivida, Enallagma anna, Ophiogomphus severus and Diplacodes trivialis which showed that differences in energy budgets can be related to differences in life histories.

N2  - P. lineatipes has the broad hindwing of glider anisopterans but the behavior of both fliers and perchers. The habitat is typically small rocky hill streams in brushlands and forest up to 2000 m elevation. Feeding flights are more sustained in females than in males. Males are on territory in the morning when they perch on rocks in gentle rapids, occasionally making a patrol flight covering up to 15 m of the stream. Copulation occurs in flight and the female oviposits alone. The larvae live between rocks in moving water. Transformation occurs at night and the adults fly as soon as they are able. A one day sample of 188 exuviae contained 70.7% females. Dorsal abdominal spines were present in 100% of the exuviae on segment 6, 97.9% on 7, 0.5% on 8, and in none on 9.

N2  - The rendezvous and opposition behaviour of L. viridis are described and the results of marking experiments are reported. The 66 have sexual appetence with territorial character. At 12 a.m. they occupy perch sites on tall trees, growing parallel to a pond’s edge. They show a strong preference for the upper parts of the trees, when they occupy and defend vertical territories which have a half globular shape (diameter 1.5-0.4 m; density dependent). The perch sites form a bar to 99 flying from assembling places in the near wood to the pond. During opposition accompanying 66 defend 99 from mating interference by other 66. The recapture rate of marked 66 was 56%, that of marked 99 16% (within a distance of 120 m from the release place). 37% of marked 66 and 10% of marked 99 were recorded at a distance of 5 m from the release point (recapture dates 1-43 days after marking).

N2  - An analysis is presented of the coexistence of 8 spring spp. in an area in Eastern Flanders, Belgium. By counting exuviae and by the mark-recapture method, the behaviour of the different spp. in space and time was followed. The data include estimates of the translocation within the area and estimates of population size and survival rate using the method of Jolly and Seber and a new regression method. – Between spp. (of different genera), differences in spatial and temporal performance were noted which result in a reduction of interaction, whether or not truly competitive. However, between the coexisting sibling spp,, Coenagrion puella and C. pulchellum, no major differences in utilisation of the environment could be found. There are indications that 99 of C. puella were driven out of their favored areas, but inspite of this they continued to oviposit at the peak density of C. puichellum. This observation leads to a reconsideration of the competitive exclusion principle.

N2  - In 2 d final instar larvae from Lake Sarah, South Island, New Zealand, the chromosome complement was counted as 2 n = 25, n = 13 (X, m). The material originates from the same locality as that studied by L.S. WOLFE (1953, Trans. R. Soc. N.Z. 80: 245-275), who reported 17 elements in the diploid set. A re-examination of the latter’s figures suggests that the count was erroneous.

N2  - A short biography of Dr. E. RUDOLPH (bom: Apr. 29, 1940, Glidice, Czechoslovakia; deceased: Aug. 18, 1978, Munster, German Federal Republic; ethologist: Assistant of Biology, Padagog. Hochschule Munster) is presented. To many odonatologists it will be a great shock to learn that EDDA RUDOLPH died in Munster, German Federal Republic, of the injuries she had received being thrown from her horse. Her death came at the early age of 38 years and cut an active and utmost enthusiastic life. Although herself specialized in a different field, she was extremely fond of dragonflies, with which she had become familiar through her husband, Dr. RAINER RUDOLPH. Many of us met them as participants in the SIO symposia at Lancaster, Great Britain, and Gainesville, Florida. Many of us will remember her keen passion on occasion of the field trips in Florida in collecting Odonata and Lepidoptera which, after having sufficiently furnished her husband, she generously distributed among those who were less successful in chasing.

N2  - A short biography and appreciation of odonatological work of C. LUNAU (born May 15, 1894, Haffkrug nr. Lubeck, German Federal Republic; secondary school teacher) are followed by his odonatological bibliography (1929-1978). All of his dragonfly opus is devoted to the local faunistics of northern Germany. Not only the worldwide scale research, but also the meticulous, continuous modest local work can often be of great importance. Such a worker is Carl Lunau, who spent, for many decades, all of his free time on systematic observations of the local fauna of his native region, and to whom we want to extend our warmest congratulations on his 85th birthday.

N2  - From Bobo-Dioulasso and the broader surroundings the male germ cell complements were examined of the following 9 spp.: Coenagrionidae: Pseudagrion whellani Pinhey; Libellulidae: Orthetrum b. brachia!e( P, de Beauv.). O. chrysostigma IBurnt.). O. guineense Ris. O. monardi Schmidt, Palpopleura lucia portia (Dru,). Trithemis atra Pinhey, T. imitata Pinhey and T. kirbyi ardens Gerst. All of them possess 13 elements in the haploid set; an m-bivalent is present in all libellulids. The P. ii /tc/Zan/complement apparently originates from an n = 14 set, but it is not clear whether or not the original X participates in the fusion, hence the identity of the small element and the mode of sex determination are uncertain. O. brachiale is the only sp. earlier studied cytologically. While the karyotype of a Kenyan specimen is clearly of a secondary origin (n 6 = 11, no m. increased chiasma frequency; cf. KIAUTA. 1969. Arnoldia. Rhodesia 4 [15]: 1-8). those of the 2 spec, from Upper Volta are of the usual Orthetrum type.

N2  - A quantification of the decrease of dragonfly spp. will be achieved by preparing distribution maps which, by using different symbols, should allow an identification of spatial and temporal distribution of records. Recent records should be further classified and commented with regard to their actual status. Stable populations should be especially denoted in the maps. Criteria for estimating the status of a dragonfly population are given, using Gomphus vulgatissimus in Schleswig-Holstein, northern German Federal Republic, as an example.

N2  - The results are reported of some laboratory experiments intended to (I) gather baseline behavioral observations of zygopteran nymphs in a simulated rush bed, (2) test a hypothesis to account for switching by nymphs between alternative prey in the laboratory, and (3) quantify some components of nymph predation on cladoceran prey. The predators were Ischnura verticalis nymphs in the 2nd day of their final instar; their movements (strikes, captures, ignores, discards) were measured during 1-hr observation periods using event recorders. The experiments were designed as a factorial with 3 main treatments (hunger: starved 24 hr, fed; — illumination: light, dark; — prey: Daphnia, Simocephalus, none) and 7 replicates of each treatment combination. Analyses of variance and orthogonal contrasts performed on the data indicate that nymphs move around more when hungry, in the light, and in the absence of prey, and that predation rates are higher for starved nymphs, in the light and with Daphnia present. The data are consistent with the switching hypothesis, but a "dispersal” interpretation is offered as an alternative explanation. These results and other evidence also imply that vision can be important in prey capture; that actively swimming prey are much more vulnerable to this classic sit-and-wait predator; and that prey ingestion depends more strongly on the frequency of predator-prey encounters than on predation efficiencies.

N2  - The prediction equations for conversion between head width, labium length, body length, and wet and dry weight along with the statistical information required for estimating errors and confidence limits are provided. All of the prediction equations (regression analysis) explain greater than 95% of the total variance. — A study of intra-instar variation in 3 morphological parameters suggests that head width is the least variable and generally most practical parameter to measure. – A study of allometric growth was concentrated on the thorax, trying to detect deviations from simple allometry for late instar larvae. No deviations were found, including the lack of a "mature” stage of larval growth which has been reported for a synchronously emerging mayfly sp. (H.F. CLIFFORD, 1970, Can. J. Zoo!. 48: 305-316). As the mature stage mayflies could apparently emerge regardless of body length, Clifford hypothesized that the mature stage aided in synchronizing emergence. The lack of such a stage in A. junius is consistent with the hypothesis because this sp. does not emerge synchronously.

His principal research on odonates is in the field of zygopteran reproductive behavior, and he has contributed to the study of the odonate distribution in the United States and to the knowledge of the life history of several anisopteran spp. I consider it an honor and a privilege to write this brief biography of Dr. G. H. Bick. I have been a student of his since my undergraduate years at Tulane University, where I found him to be a most enthusiastic and stimulating teacher. As his teaching assistant during two summers in Oklahoma and as his research assistant every summer since 1970, the times I have spent with Dr. Bick and his wife Juanda have been the most academically rewarding times of my life. In the field he is a tireless and energetic worker intent upon the pursuit and successful completion of the assigned problem. While his major interest has been in the odonates, he has spent many hours studying the flora and fauna and the ecology of every region of the U. S. we have visited. Asa direct result of this interest he has been responsible for the establishment of a Nature Area at St. Mary’s College, which he has maintained and studied for many years.

The estimates of food consumption on May 16 and 19 were 4.61 mg (min. 3.30, max. 7.67) and 5.38 mg (min. 3.61, max. 7.04) respectively. The ratios of these values to body weight amounted to 9,7% and 11.4% respectively. In addition, the daily change in stomach contents and the instantaneous rate of food output from the stomach were examined for estimating food consumption. Daily food consumption in Sympetrum frequens, Calopteryx cornelia and M. pruinusa was compared and a discussion is presented on the functions of the dragonfly territory, particularly on the function of the "prevention of food shortage".

N2  - The coenagrionid C. tenellum was studied by capture-recapture and direct observation in several neighbouring areas along a small stream in the New Forest, Hampshire, England. The New Forest is important ecologically because it is probably the last remaining area of heathland in lowland Britain which is large enough to support many of the characteristic plants and animals. Notably, the Forest’s bogs and nearby heathland provide habitats for C. lenellum, resulting in this species being commoner there than anywhere else in Britain. The imaginal C. lenellum was very selective in the areas of stream colonised: it was only common where the stream was wide and boggy with a dense growth of Hypericum elodes. Deeply incised and clear, gravelly parts of the stream were avoided. Most individuals in well established populations were highly static, but a high proportion of insects in sites away from the main population centres were wanderers. Most movement within an established colony was from the periphery inwards; relatively few individuals were observed to move from the centre outwards. Adult male C. lenellum show relatively little tendency to move far once they are associated with a colonial group. The population numbers declined consistently throughout the study periods (first three weeks of August, 1974 and 1975), and only five individuals out of 704 males seen were teneral. The mean length of the life for adult males in different populations varied between 8 and 17 days. Survivorship in males was nearly random with age for the major part of the life span. A detailed analysis of the capture-recapture data revealed only one occasion when marking had a deleterious effect on survival. The percentage of males ranged from 57 to 68 percent and the mean mating frequencies were 13 percent (males) and 35 percent (females). Frequent aerial fighting between males was not observed to lead directly to movement of any individuals away from the colony area. A few male-to-male interactions were definitely sexual. Mating occurred at water, in fine weather, and falls into the copulation type classified as ’long’.

N2  - The distribution of the leg spines on the tibia and tarsi is described for the larvae of 3 anisopterans: Anax imperator Leach, Aeshna cyanea (Mull.) and Libellula sp. There are 2 rows of spines on the ventral surface of the legs and these rows broaden at the distal ends of the tibia and first 2 tarsal segments. There are 2 types of spine, single and tridentate. There are differences in their distribution between spp., but the greatest differences are between each of the 3 pairs of legs. The innervation of the spines of Anax is described and is typical of other insect mechanoreceptors. There is a single, bipolar sensory neuron, the dendrite of which gives rise to a ciliary structure. This ends distally in a tubular body at the base of the spine. The sensory apparatus is surrounded by three enveloping cells. The definition of tubular bodies and the optimal stimulus are discussed.

[Contribution to the knowledge of the odonate fauna of the Rio Grande do Sul], Arqs Mus. nac. 54: 17-24. (Portuguese). — (Pontificia Univ. Carolina, Porto Alegre, RS. Brazil). An annotated list is given of 16 zygopteran and 24 anisopteran spp. from the Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Some of the taxa listed are identified to the genus only. (2419) LAI, Y.L., 1971. An introduction to the Odonata of Hong Kong. New Asia College Academic Annual 13 (Sept. 1971): 1-48. (Chinese, with Engl. s.). — (Biol. Dept.. Univ. Sei. Centre, Chinese Univ. Hong Kong, Smalin. Hong Kong). The history of odonatology of the crown colony of Hong Kong is traced from 1854 to present. The fullest and most authoritative account of the fauna is that by S. Asahina (1965, Kontyu 33: 493-506). The present paper is based on the previously published data and on extensive collections made by the Department of Biology, New Asia College, Chinese University of Hong Kong, brought together during several yrs in the New Territories, Kowloon and in the Hong Kong Island. In all, 56 spp. are described, among which 22 are new to the Colony. Special attention is being paid to their habits, reproductive behaviour and life histories. A complete list of the 77 spp. hitherto recorded from Hong Kong is also provided. It is mainly based on Dr. Asahina’s 1965 account. — (Abstracter's note: As is apparent from the photographs accompanying the paper, some spp. have been erroneously identified: Fig. 13: Anax parthenope Julius, not ”A. guttatus”; — Fig. 16: probably a teneral Gynacanthajaponica, stated only as "Gynacantha sp.”; — Fig. 17: probably Aeschnophlebia anisoptera, not "Planaeschna sp.”; — Fig. 18: Ictinogomphus pertinax, not ”1. rapax”; — Fig. 19: Leptogomphus perforatus, not ”L. sauteri”; — Fig. 20: Tholymis tillarga, not "Epitheca sp."; — Fig, 21; Zyxomma petiolatum, not "Somatochlora dido”; — Fig. 28: Rhyothemis variegata, not "Hydrobasileus croceus”; — Fig. 35: Orthetrum pruinosum neglectum, not ”0. testaceum”; — Fig. 41: probably subadult of Trithemis aurora, not "Sympetrum imitans”; — Fig. 42: probably Brachythemis contaminata, not "Sympetrum striolatum”; — Fig. 56: Mnais mneme, not ”M. earnshawi”; — Fig. 66: Prodasineura autumnalis, not ’Tndoneura delorosa”; — Fig. 71: Agriocnemis femina oryzae, not "A. lacteola”; — and Fig. 76: Ceriagrion latericum ryukyuanum, and not ”C. coromandelianum" as stated in the captions. It is certainly unfortunate that the synonyms and/or identifications have not been checked by an experienced taxonomist prior to publication, though the biological notes are certainly among the very few so far published in Chinese, hence they might inspire other Chinese workers to undertake more systematic work in the field of ecology, bionomy and behaviour of the Chinese spp.).

N2  - The head is prognathous in the larva, but hypognathous in the adult. In the larva, the prey is captured by the labial hooks. The labium is then flexed to bring the prey to the mandibles and maxillae for mastication. The labrum. maxillae and labium are moved out of phase with the mandibles. In the adult, the prey is captured by the front legs and the labium plays no part in food capture and little in feeding. However, the mandibles and maxillae are used as in the larva. The growth of the head capsule at metamorphosis of the larva into the adult is compared with the changes occurring in other Odon. and the differences are discussed.

N2  - Odon. are useful environmental monitoring agents. Most spp. show specific responses to environmental disturbances. The nymphal stage is the most reliable for obtaining population information, but the nymphs of many spp. remain undescribed. Adult Odon. can be easily identified, but high adult vagility necessitates careful evaluation of recorded occurrences. High vagility does, however, insure rapid re-establishment in suitable habitats. An unusually high number of Virginia Anisoptera may be considered rare or possibly endangered, many of which are found only in undisturbed habitats, suggesting that they are very sensitive to environmental disturbances. A list of 60 rare and endangered spp. is given in a table along with notes on their status in Virginia. The environmental monitoring potential of the Odon. cannot be fully achieved unless more attention is given to nymphal descriptions, and baseline faunal surveys.

N2  - L. congener Hag., L. disjunctus Sel, and L. dryas Kirby were found to be common inhabitants of a saline lake series on the Chilcotin Plateau of central British Columbia. L. unguiculatus Hag., the only other sp. of the genus in British Columbia, did not occur in the region, although it is characteristic of similar habitats at lower elevations 130 km to the south. — In the lakes studied, ionic concentrations and compositions differed considerably. Conductivities ranged from 72 to 15524 mieromhos/cm at 25°C; the main cations were sodium and magnesium and the main anions were carbonate and bicarbonate. /., dryas colonized only the fresher water bodies, those with conductivities up to 1254 micromhos/cm and pH levels below 9.0. while L. disjundus occurred in lakes with conductivities up to4892 micromhos/cm and pH measurementsto9.0.1., congener inhabited the complete range of salinities examined and occurred in very large numbers even at the upper limit of conductivity and at a pH of 9.3. Emergence and mating of the 3 spp. were temporally separate; dryas emerged 10 or 11 days before disjundus, which preceded congener by 9 days. The main disjundus emergence occurred approximately 20 days before the peak of the congener emergence. – The possible influences of salinity on both the distribution of the species within the lake series and the timing of their emergence were examined.

N2  - In the hitherto studied taxa (12) of the genus the <5 haploid numbers range from 13 to 19, viz.; n=!3: moesta (Hag.), nahuana Calv., translata Hag.; n=!4: fumipennis atra Gloyd, f.fumipennis .(Burm.), f. violacea (Hag.), funebris (Hag.), immunda (Hag.), sedula (Hag.), vivida (Hag.); n=!9: apicalis (Say), tibialis (Ramb.). An additional element occurs in some populations of f. atra and f. violacea (n= 15), but only in the former is its bivalent structure more or less apparent. Save for translata and for the n= 15 sets of f. alra and f. violacea, mchromosomes are lacking. Aside from one case in Pseudagrion, this is the only coenagrionide genus in which spp. occur with n lower than the family type number (14); n=!9 is the highest chromosome number yet recorded in a dragonfly. The low-n complements are of a secondary origin and are characterized by an increased chiasma frequency. The reduction of n is due to the obligatory fusion of 2 pairs of the primary karyotype. The n= 15 complements are not obligatory and are due to fragmentation of one of the original pairs (bivalents). The elements of the n=!9 spp. have the usual Argia size; the origin of the high-n complements is unknown, and their TCL is significantly higher than that of the n= 14 sets. The variation of n does not appear significant on the subgeneric level. The evolutionary significance of the exceptionally high variation in the recombination potentials is discussed and it is concluded that the genus is in the midst of an intense evolutionary process, and is far from having reached its final adaptive level. In this feature Argia is unique among the higher taxa of the Order that so far have been studied cytologically.

N2  - Patterns of daily mating activity in 4 spp. of Micrathyria were determined by hourly censuses at sites in the Panama Canal Zone, M. atra and M. ocellata appear at breeding sites before sunrise and are present until late afternoon, but the time of maximum activity varies depending on the abundance of congeneric spp. and secondarily on physical factors in the environment. The smaller spp,. M. aequalis and Micrathyria sp. A (nr. eximia) are invariably active only from mid-morning until mid-afternoon. The presence of 99 at breeding sites does not always coincide with maximal <5 activity. Less complete data are available for several other spp. in the Canal Zone and Costa Rica. — M. atra dcJ remain at breeding sites only 3-4 hrs at a time, while M. ocellala and M. aequalis individuals often are present for 8-9 hrs. Individuals of all spp. vary from day today in timing of activity and position of local territory. Aggressive interactions are common between Micrathyria spp. and with several unrelated spp. The number of aggressive encounters of individual ocellata with aequalis depends strongly on the density of aequalis present. These 2 spp. overlap considerably in perch choice. Distribution of food within the alimentary tract of atra and ocellala suggested that they do not feed at breeding sites and that most individuals present before mid-morning have not fed since the previous day.

N2  - The observations were carried out on a colony of the pale montane form of O.j. falsum Longf. (8 April – 4 June, 1977) at Naisi, Zomba Mountain, southern Malawi. 277 dd and 13 99 were given unique numbers on the wings which enabled recognition without subsequent recapture, and the positions of territorial dd were recorded accurately each time the colony was visited. The most frequently seen individuals showed the greatest consistency of localization. This indicates that the most frequently seen individuals were superior in territorial defence and hence tended to return most often to a chosen area. Whereas a territory might measure up to 10 m in diameter, the central zone, where the insect spent 75% of its territorial time, would be only about 2.5 m2, or less. Many territories were much smaller than 5 m in diameter. The outer zone territories of neighbouring insects often overlapped. In the late afternoon, the highly structured territorial system broke down and many widely ranging dd were observed to invade the colony area. In the mornings the territories tended to be occupied as soon as they were in partial or full sunlight. The territorial dd spent 5-13% of their time in flight, depending on weather conditions. About 60% of all territorial flights were aggressive and 20% were feeding flights. 99 occurred at the breeding sites at any time during the territorial period, but observed matings took place 10.13-14.45 hrs. The mean copula duration was 29.5 sec. Usually the 9 oviposited in the d’s territory immediately after copulation there and was attended by him, hovering over her. The mean survival for mature dd was 9.0 days and maximum observed survival was 51 days.

N2  - A. vivida ranges at least from Mexico to southern Alberta, and larvae live in both warm and cold streams. In warm (geothermally heated) sites in Alberta, Oregon and Idaho, the life cycle is generally univoltine and larval growth is regulated by a short-day induced diapause in the penultimate larval instar. In sites with naturally fluctuating temperature regimes, however, the life cycle appears to be generally semivoltine. The role of diapause in this 2-year life cycle is presently unknown.

N2  - A short biographyof J. RACENIS(born April 10, 1915, Riga. Latvia; teaching and research career mainly at the Universidad Central de Venezuela; founder and director of several scientific institutions in Venezuela) is followed by a list of new odonate taxa he described and by his odonatological bibliography (1953-1979). All of his work is devoted to fauna and taxonomy of the Neotropical Region, and nearly everything known on the Venezuelan dragonflies goes to his credit. Ii was only in the spring of 1979 that I have met Dr. J. Rdcenis for the first lime in person. The brief period that has elapsed since our first meeting was enough to get to know him as a very hospitable and kind man, but it is in no wav sufficient to get more than a small idea of his vast scientific knowledge and experience. This short article, therefore, renders him only inadequately the honors he deserves as the veteran of Venezuelan odonatology. Since November 1979 a serious illness holds him confined to bed and restrains his activities. But, whenever / visit him in his home near Caracas, where he is living with his wife and daughter, he always helps me with dragonfly identifications and. most patiently, answers my beginner's questions. Earlier in 1979, Dr. Rdcenis invited me several limes to the Faeuldad de Agronomic of the Universidad Central de Venezuela in Maracay, where a part of his private odonate collection is housed. It consists of some 20.000 mostly neotropical specimens. This huge material includes the types of the laxa described hy him. as well as several still undescribed species.

N2  - I. erratica, previously poorly known, has been found to be locally common between southwestern British Columbia and the San Francisco Bay region of California. It is an early spring species, flying progressively later toward the north; extreme dates are 23 March and 8 August. Adults typically occur at beaver ponds but inhabit other fresh-water habitats as well. Behavior is atypical for Ischnura but rather similar to many species of Enallagma and Coenagrion. Other attributes of the species indicate it may occupy a primitive position within the genus.

N2  - Census data suggest that population sex ratios of adult C. maculata (P. de Beauv.) and C. dimidiata Burm. are 1:1 despite an excess of males (significant in C. maculata only) at the water. The adult sex ratios of both species, however, were strongly influenced by where censuses were made and the differences found appeared to reflect different activity patterns of males and females and not true distortions of the population sex ratios. Reproductive potential of C. maculala females was estimated from egg counts and sperm volume indices of dissected females. Those females collected along the stream prior to the daily (1300-1500 hrs) peak in reproductive activity and those collected immediately before or after copulation carried maximum numbers of eggs (averages = 267-272). There was a steady decrease in egg number per female during the day. Females collected after 10-15 min of oviposition and those collected in woods adjacent to the stream carried the fewest eggs (averages = 155 and 177). Sperm volume indices also decreased during the day in samples of females at the water. Maximum sperm volumes were found in postcopula females. However, females collected in tandem prior to copulation had 83% of the maximum and females collected after 10-15 min of oviposition had 90% of the maximum sperm index. Females collected in the woods still carried 65% of the maximum. The substantial sperm volumes carried by females prior to mating and after oviposition suggest that many matings may occur primarily to provide access to specific oviposition sites and guarding males. The variations found in female reproductive potential are consistent with predicted female activity patterns that would result in an excess of males at the water.

When they sit on the wet sand they are unable to take readily on wing, and as the billows break they get surrounded by the receding waters and ultimately get partly buried and immobilized under the rolling sand.

N2  - A short biography and appreciation of odonatological work of R.M. GAMBLES are followed by a list of new taxa he described and by his odonatological bibliography (1951-1980). Most of his work is devoted to the fauna of West Africa, especially Nigeria. We are honoured to write this short appreciation of Mr Robert Moylan Gambles on the occasion of his 70 th birthday. It is a great pleasure to bring to a wider circle of colleagues Robert Gambles' outstanding contribution to Odonatology, and to underline how much he is esteemed and respected as a scientist and as a friend. Our own odonatological studies in Africa would hardly have been possible without his generous and detailed assistance.

N2  - Territorial behaviour is shown to exist in the weed-dwelling larvae of X. zealandica. Caudal swinging, usually interpreted as a ventilation movement, was found to be an intraspecific threat display. In the laboratory, a uniform spatial distribution of larvae was obtained. This result has implications for resource partitioning by predators in the littoral zone.

N2  - The observations were carried out (1977-1979) at 3 localities in British Columbia, Canada. Reproductive activity began as early as 09.30. Sperm translocation. always in tandem, was always followed immediately by copula. Copula was intermittent, lasting 23-58 min., followed by exploratory oviposition for 10-27 min. Effective oviposition was both in tandem at the surface and unaccompanied, with the female submerged and the male guarding. Guarding lasted 7-35 min. Host plants included healthy tissue of Callitriche verna L., Nuphar polysepalum Engelm., Sparganium minimum Fries and Scirpus sp. The submerged female oviposited with head down while backing up the stem. Submerged oviposition lasted as long as 90 min, a record submergence interval in the Odonata.

N2  - Larvae of 35 spp. have been collected in sweep-net samples from the littoral zone of a lake and a pond at Bays Mountain Park. Tennessee, USA. Several spp. are apparently restricted to the fish-free pond ( Anax juntus, A. longipes, Libellula cyanea, Tramea lacerata, Archilestes grandis, Lestes eurinus, Enallagma aspersum); others ( Aeshna umbrosa. Erythemis simplicicollis, Plathemis lydia) are found predominantly in the pond. Bays Mountain Lake contains several spp. of insectivorous fish. Its odon. assemblage is dominated by spp. that utilize submersed macrophyte and allochthonous detritus habitats; 6 of these account for about 909; of the larvae in the lake (Tetragoneuria cynosura, Celithemis elisa, C. fasciata, Enallagma divagans, E. signatum, E. traviatum). Seasonal segregation of life histories probably reduces competition among these dominant spp.; habitat segregation may be more important among the less abundant spp.

N2  - Microscopic and ultrastructural studies of the ileum of anisopteran larvae reveal the existence of thick and thin epithelia. The thick epithelium apparently is organised for ion transport. The cells are covered with a multilayered cuticula. The apical cell membrane is much folded. Many mitochondria occur beneath these foldings. The basal cell membrane is also folded and closely associated with mitochondria. The lateral cell membranes are simularly folded. Septate desmosome structures are present. Transporting epithelia in the anterior part of the hindgut may play an important role in the osmoregulation of the haemolymph of the larvae by reabsorbing ions from the urine, produced by the Malpighian tubules.

This phenomenon can be explained by the ease with which dragonflies disperse on the forest-tundra open space, rich in surface waters.

N2  - A quantitative analysis of the chemical composition of the haemolymph is provided. Sodium and chloride appear to be the major electrolytes primarily responsible for maintaining the osmotic balance. Besides a high concentration of trehalose, haemolymph also contains glucose and glycogen in low concentration. Neutral lipids, phospholipids and cholesterol are present in varying amounts. A high concentration of proteins and a low concentration of inorganic phosphorus seem to be peculiar features of the haemolymph of dragonfly larvae.

N2  - Large and dense feeding aggregations of O. ferruginea directly over large trays of black pepper berries drying in the sun were studied near La Virgen. Heredia Province, Costa Rica. Several years of general observation on this species in northeastern Costa Rica revealed adult densities of less than one dragonfly/m2 at roadside ditches and clearings in secondary growth forest. Yet the densities observed over the black pepper ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 dragonflies/m2, a large increase over nearby habitats. Daily abundance of O. ferruginea over the black pepper was 30-50 individuals, predominantly males. Adults arrived each morning by 07.00 hours reaching peak densities by 07.30 hours, and flying over the fruit and capturing small flies as prey. The deliberate removal of the trays of fruit results in a sudden exodus of the dragonflies from the area. Undisturbed departures are usually by 08.00 hours. O. ferruginea opportunistically aggregates in areas of habitat where large densities of prey occur, although the mechanism underlying such behavior was not determined.

N2  - The tarso-pretarsal (TP) chordotonal organ is described. It is unusual in that only a small number (ca 8) of bipolar sensory cell bodies are present in the cellular strand. Each scolopidium encloses a single centriolar derivative. The cilium arises from a cross-striated ciliary root and has a 9 + 0 axoneme configuration running from base to apex of the centriolar derivative. A scolopale cell surrounds each cilium to form the intracellular scolopale, extracellular scolopale space and distal cap. No attachment cell is seen distally, instead each scolopidium appears in close association with the surrounding strand cells. Unidirectional sensory units were recorded from the TP organ. Most of these were sensitive to flexion. New names are proposed for some insect joint chordotonal organs to conform with crustacean terminology.

N2  - The Federal Act, BArtSchV, promulgated August 25, 1980, prohibits the collecting of any odon. sp. on the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, and places the odon. collections under governmental supervision. Since no case is known in the world that an odon. Population would be threatened with extinction by overcollecting, whereas the destruction and/or manipulation of the habitats are the principal cause for the d isappearance of local populations, it is argued that the present Act will contribute nothing to odon. Conservation, but will rather cause a significant set back of scientific research and of the role dragonflies play in the biology teaching schemes on all levels. The Act should be mitigated as follows: 12 common spp. should be free for educational purposes in the broadest sense, the others should be free for scientific research, with possible exception of those considered threatened with local extinction. On the list of the lauer the IUCN Survival Commission (Odonata Specialist Group) is the authority to be consulted.

Additional notes and figures are given of the type-species R. serrata ( Hagen in Selys) with its larva, and of R. haematopus (Selys), all from the island of Luzon. Illustrated redescriptions are supplied of R. ignea and incisa, whose characters are compared with those of reflexa, which turns out to be synonymous with the earlier described haematopus.

N2  - A pair of lateral chordotonal organs is found in abdominal segments 2 to 8 in larvae of Anax imperator Leach, Aeshna cyanea r(Müll.)and Libellula depressa L. The ultrastructure of the chordotonal organs has been determined. Each contains three scolopidia embedded in a connective tissue strand. A single type 1 cilium from a bipolar neuron innervates each scolopidium and is surrounded by a scolopale cell which forms the intracellular scolopale, extracellular space and distal cap. Surrounding the distal region of the scolopidium is the attachment cell. Activity from the longitudinal and vertical stretch receptors has been recorded from an intact larva. These receptors behave antagonistically to each other during rhythmic ventilation. Electrophysiological recordings also indicate that the chordotonal organ is active during expiration. This suggests a relaxation sensitive organ, a finding which is discussed in relation to its ultrastructure.

N2  - The <J chromosome number is 2n = 21, n = 11, incl. an m-pair and the univalent X. The complement is of a secondary origin, the result of a fusion of 6 elements of the primary, 2n d = 25 set. The fusion is obligatory in all cells and permanent in all stages of the mitotic cycle. This is the first case of a low-n complement in Platycnemididae. Chiasma frequency is not increased, hence the recombination index is extremely low. This situation favours the survival value and reproductive capability of incisa, makes the sp. fit to settle down over a wide geographic range, but it restricts its adaptability to substantial ecological diversity of habitats. Considering the deviation of the recombination index from the family level, coupled with structural affinities and geographic range of the genus, it is suggested that Risiocnemis is likely to represent a phylogenetically young offshot of the calicnemine stock.

IWASAKI (born: Dec. 22,1954, Nishinomiya, Japan; deceased; Sept. 23, 1980, same place; odonatologist, Ph.D. student of Kyoto University) is followed by his odonatological bibliography (1974-1981). On September 23, 1980, Masamichi Iwasaki passed away at the early age of twenty-five. He was a Ph.D. student of Kyoto University and had been working devotedly on calopterygid behaviour. His premature death cannot be too much deplored.

N2  - Forty-nine Anisoptera, comprising 19 sp. and 13 genera, were captured on about 11% of nights at risk in 2 light-traps operated nightly in Trinidad for 14 months. Most spp. and individuals were captured during the rainy season (June through December). ’Older’ adults predominated in catches at the beginning and end of the rainy season, and ’younger’ adults about 3 months after its onset. The results are consistent with the assumption that old adults, having retired to shaded refuges, provide continuity during the dry season and then, at the start of the rains, become active in exposed situations and promptly reproduce, adults of the ensuing generation emerging 2-4 months later.

N2  - A Florida colony of T. thoreyi was studied throughout the flight season of 25 March-28 May 1978. Larvae of several instars were found near the uphill edges of permanent seeps in deciduous forest, hiding between or under leaves in thin sheets of flowing water. In captivity they preferred to live above water on wet soil. Transformation occurred on any vertical support 0.2-1.4 m above ground during mid-morning, and sexual maturity was attained in 2-3 weeks. Males searched tree trunks or waited in the seepage areas for females. Males had no day-to-day site fidelity at the seeps. Larger prey taken was about 2/3 Lepidoptera and 1/3 Odonata. The minimum population, based on individual marking and collection data, was 128 males and 46 females. Marked males moved distances of at least I. I km, and both sexes shifted locations often. The egg and 3 larval instars are described. Ecological adaptations and ecological relationships with Cordulegaster are discussed.

N2  - Copulatory activity is described in Enallagma cyathigerum; some observations on reproductive behaviour of Calopteryx splendens and some other zygopterans are also included. Copulatory activity is divisible into 3 stages: in stage /, which may occupy more than 75% of the time, there are continual rhythmical movements of the abdomen of the male. In stage II, the abdominal positions change and a new type of rhythmic activity appears, also due to the male, while in stage III, the positions again change but there are no visible movements. Dissection of pairs killed at different stages of copulation suggests that stage I may be concerned with sperm removal from the female, while during //and ///sperm is transferred to the female. The female cannot escape from the tandem association but can accept or reject copulation, and she may terminate the activity during stage /. Stages //and III have not been seen to be spontaneously interrupted. — Dissection of the male secondary genitalia and their examination in scanning electronmicrographs shows the penis head to possess a variety of hooks and bristles. These have been seen to hold trapped sperm when pulled from females in copula. In restrained decapitated males, activity of the penis and associated movements of abdominal segments occur spontaneously or can be evoked mechanically. They resemble the activity occurring naturally in stage /, Electromyograms have been used to verify the contributions of 3 sets of muscles to the movements.

Hunier Coll., City Univ. New York. Room 210, 695 Park A ve. New York. N. Y. 10021. USA). This is abstract of the programme, "The cyclops eye of the dragon fly", presented at the meeting of the New York Ent. Soc., Feb. 20, 1973. — [Verbatim]; The role and development of the dragonfly median ocellus are discussed in light of recent neurophysiological evidence obtained from intracellular recordings of receptors and postsynaptic units and from electron micrographs of synaptic organization. Behaviorally, dragonflies whose ocelli were occluded in the field flew up to a branch and remained there as long as they were observed (one hour) while those whose compound eyes were occluded flew skyward until they disappeared from sight, indicating possible roles in diurnal behavior and phototaxis. On the basis of neurophysiological recordings and feedback synaptic organization, an additional role as a shadow or motion detector was suggested. A study of the development of a population of 32 nymphs of Aeshna tuberculifera revealed that while the presumptive lateral and median ocelli could not be identified prior to the fourth day of the final instar, they could always be found after the eighth day of the final instar. The mean duration of the final instar was 30.4 days (standard deviation of 6.6 days) for a population of 245 dragonflies of the species Aeshna tuberculifera and Anax junius. The preceding instar (instar -I) had a mean duration of 16.8 days (standard deviation of 3.6 days) for a population of 100 dragonflies. For ten dragonflies reared through instar -2, the mean duration of that instar was 15.1 days. Developmental study suggests the possibility of severing the ocellar nerve prior to emergence in order to obtain denervated adult ocelli for neurophysiological study. (3155) GANDHI, Y„ 1973.

N2  - Literature records of naturally occurring heterospecific pairs are summarized on a worldwide basis. The 93 pairs include: 11 between members of different families, 21 between different genera, 61 between different species. In all, 10 families, 34 genera, 124 species are represented. Anisoptera genera with the greatest number of species in the mixed pairs are Sympetrum and Gomphus; Zygoptera genera are Lestes and Enallagma. An important factor limiting the number of records of mixed pairs is difficulty in determining the females of many genera. Despite the seemingly numerous records and the taxonomic spread of the mixed pairs (actually only a small proportion of the entire Order), there are only two records of heterospecific pairs ovipositing and two (one very doubtful) of hybrids resulting from observed mixed pairs under natural conditions. The species of Odonata are apparently effectively isolated even though mixed tandems and mixed wheel positions do occur.

N2  - Several body dimensions were measured in 29 spp. The relationship between pairs of dimensions was determined by allometric analysis. In general, the wings of dragonflies become relatively longer and narrower as body mass increases; fliers have longer but thinner wings than perchers of comparable size. These trends are probably the result of differences in energetic and structural requirements in flight. Thoracic diameter and volume increase more rapidly than expected as thoracic mass increases and are relatively greater in fliers than in perchers. Thoracic dimensions are partly determined by increased selection for insulating, sub-cuticular air sacs in large fliers.

N2  - A description is given of the anatomy of the penis and of associated secondary genital structures. The penis of Anisoptera is not homologous with that of Zygoptera, and it consists of a 4-segmented organ with inflatable structures on the last segment. The hamuli and the anterior frame cooperate to swing the ligula ventrally and this action in turn thrusts the penis posteriorly. The same movement also causes a hamular claw to close, and this is believed to grasp a rim on the female’s genital plate during copulation. The penis cannot be withdrawn without the grasp being loosened. Rhythmical movements which appear in stage 1 of copulation are interpreted to represent activity which packs previously deposited sperm down in the female tract, and it is suggested that sperm removal is less important in this species than the displacement of sperm within the female tract.

N2  - Progomphus obscurus and Gomphus externus larvae were studied in both laboratory and field during July, 1976, regarding their burrowing habits and their association with substrates. They were found to burrow completely beneath bottom substrates by using their front and middle legs, never deeper than 2 cm; small larvae burrowed less deeply. — Field studies revealed that both spp, occurred in the stream in relatively high numbers and were distributed in either a contagious or random manner. Population structure of both spp. was similar and consisted mainly of late instars. Statistical analysis of physical factors measured (substrate particle size, digested organics and detritus) and the occurrence of each sp. demonstrated a correlation between particle size and occurrence of each sp. P. obscurus lends to inhabit microhabitats in stream where sand substrate (1-0.625 mm) predominates. Microdistribution of G. externus is most strongly correlated with the amount of silt/clay substrate present (less than or equal to 0.0625 mm), but percentage of organics was also significant. Although other environmental factors may have had an effect on the distribution of these 2 spp., the primary factor was substrate particle size.

N2  - M. jocaste was observed laying eggs in a water-containing tree-hole in a forest of Bolivia. The insect hovered above the hole and making jerky movements with the curved abdomen, threw individual eggs at the water surface in the direction of the shaded area underneath the roof of the hole. The abdomen did not touch the water and the eggs, after drifting horizontally for a short distance, remained floating. The increased efficiency brought about by the possibility of throwing eggs into tree-holes from the outside was probably the most important selective factor involved in the appearance of this unique type of oviposition. A new interpretation for the long abdomen of pseudostigmatids is proposed based on its mechanical advantages for throwing eggs.

N2  - A settled female of T. polleni places a mass of eggs, up to 2 m above the prevailing water level, on the surface of upright sticks or dead sedge stems. The eggs, several hundred to a mass, adhere to the stem and hatch there, without falling into the water. Females of exophytic Odonata seldom attach eggs directly to a substrate, and very rarely when settled. Such behaviour may enable T. polleni to oviposit successfully in turbid, astatic, standing waters immediately after the onset of the rains and thus to prey intensively on larvae of the mosquito. Anopheles gambiae Giles. In its oviposition behaviour, the African T. polleni closely resembles other species of Tetrathemis in Africa and India, except that it selects dry bark or dead stems instead of green foliage as oviposition substrates.

N2  - The mating behaviour of Platycypha fitzsimonsi, Chlorocypha consueta and Rhinocypha unimaculata is described and compared with that of P. caligata (described elsewhere). Generally, as in P. caligata, males of the first two (and possibly the third) species are territorial around oviposition sites, attract females to these and court them there. Unlike P. caligata, P. fitzsimonsi males use only the blue tip of the abdomen in female attraction and vibrate the expanded and cream-coloured tibiae differently in courtship. Differential recognition of these two different displays by females of the two species apparently allows their sympatric coexistence. Unlike the Platycypha species. C. consueta males only use their unexpanded white tibiae in the courtship display, i.e. not also in territorial interactions. which also involves display of the pink-red abdomen dorsum. R. unimaculata again uses its unexpanded white tibiae and femora in courtship but also displays iridescent green bands on its hind wing in a fashion similar to some Calopteryx courtship displays. Expectations of complex and varied courtship displays in most chlorocyphids appear justified.

DOERKSEN (born: July 5, 1940, New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada; deceased:? 30 July 1981, Liard River Hotsprings, British Columbia; entomologist, photographer and teacher) is followed by his odonatological bibliography (1979-1981). His odonatological notebooks and photographs are deposited in the British Columbia Provincial Museum, Victoria. To all who knew George Doerksen — that enthusiastic and energetic entomologist, naturalist, photographer and teacher — his sudden and tragic death this past summer was a great shock. As always in the summer, George was in the field, this time near the northern border of British Columbia at Liard River Hotsprings, about 560 km northwest of Fort Saint John. According to reports, he was in his camp during the night of July 30-31, 1981, when he was attacked and killed by a grizzly bear. There were no witnesses, but authorities, reconstructing the tragedy, believe he was killed when, in the dark, he surprised a bear that was attempting to break into his car.

N2  - The behavior of unpaired males of the dark-winged A.f. atra Gloyd and A.f. fumipennis (Burnt.) was compared with that of the clear-winged A.f. violacea (Hag.). The dark and clear-winged subspecies differed primarily in that the former had more wing-clapping episodes per unit of time, more claps per episode, and a greater clap angle. — The reproductive behavior of the dark-winged A.f. alra was similar in most respects to that of the clear-winged species of Argia. Without courtship, males seized females at water and intramale sperm translocation in tandem (X = 14.6 sec) and the wheel position (X = 24.4 min) quickly followed. The wheel consisted of two phases: an initial long period (X = 19.9 min) of pumping when sperm from a previous mating was probably removed, followed by a brief (X = 4.5 min) terminal period without pumping when the male probably inseminated the female. After an exploratory period averaging 33.8 min, pairs oviposited in tandem at the water surface for an average of 58.2 min. U nlike clear-winged species of Argia. A.f. alra males frequently wing clapped during the wheel position, and both sexes clapped during oviposition.

N2  - The relationship between maturation stage and movement pattern was studied in a C. cornelia population on the Muromi River, Fukuoka, Japan. Adult males intruding into another male’s territory were expelled aggressively by the resident, but they usually remained within a range of 50-60 m along the stream. On the other hand, tenerals of both sexes appearingin an adult male’s territory were not expelled, and they usually remained at the periphery of a territory. However, they were likely to move upstream during the study period. As the population density at the stream increased, mature males established their territories between the existing territories of other males.

N2  - The behaviour of C. boltoni was observed and the presence of individually marked males was recorded continuously at a rivulet in the Fichtelgebirge, southeastern Germany. The males spend a considerable amount of their time patrolling up and down along rivulets. They are aggressive towards each other, but do not restrict their flight range and do not delimit territories. Females only rarely visit rivulets for mating and ovipositing, without obvious site preference. — The intraspecific aggression effects a spacing-out of the males and possibly a regulation of male density at the mating place (or rendezvous site). This behaviour of being aggressive towards competitors but not delimiting territories may be an optimal mating strategy for Cordulegaster males in their specific ecological situation.

N2  - Male L. vigilax are shown to displace (remove and reposition) sperm from previous males stored in the bursa copulalrix of females they mate with. Females carry sperm from two or more matings in a large bursa copulatrix. Spermathecae do not exist in this lestid. The magnitude of sperm displacement, while difficult to estimate because of changes in sperm density, appears to be on the order of 50%. Displacement occurs primarily from the central region of the bursa adjacent to the vagina. The last male to mate appears to gain a fertilization advantage by not only displacing the sperm of previous males, but also by placing his sperm closest to the area where fertilization occurs. Male L. vigilax penis morphology used for sperm displacement is less complex than that used by coenagrionid and calopterygids so far studied.

N2  - – Two groups of larvae ( r + F-l, F-2 + F-3) were presented 2 different sizes of Daphnia magna at various densities. F + F-l larvae chose preferentially the bigger prey when overall prey densities were high, independently of relative densities. Larvae from the 2 other instars chose bigger prey even when density was low, but were more selective when prey densities were high than when they were low. This preferential choice was not exclusive: Anax larvae never completely ignored smaller prey. The analysis of selectivity at different phases of feeding behaviour shows that selection generally occurs prior to the orientation towards a prey item.

N2  - The influence of temperature, light intensity, cloudiness and wind intensity on daily activity of C. puella at a pond in Lower Austria is discussed. For initiating flight activity, a minimum light intensity of 60 x lOMux is needed. No flight activity was observed on cloudy days with light intensity values lying below the threshold of 60 x 103 lux or wind intensity > 8 m s'1.

N2  - A short biography of C.F. BYERS (bom Nov. 18,1902, Johnstown, Pennsylvania, USA; deceased Oct. 27, 1981, Williston, Florida, USA; educator and entomologist) is followed by a list of his odonatological publications (1925-1981). On October 27, 1981, Professor C. F. Byers died at a nursing home in Williston, a small town near Gainesville, Florida after a prolonged illness. Dr CHARLES FRANCIS BYERS was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, November 18, 1902, and attended school there through high school, where he graduated in 1921. He then went to the University of Michigan where he received the A.B., M.S., and lastly the Ph.D. in 1929. Along the way he studied for a semester in 1924 at the University of Florida and for the school year 1926-1927 at Cornell University where he did some work with Prof. James G. Needham in the Entomology Department. He attended summer schools at the Marine Biological Station in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and the University of Michigan Biological Station at Douglas Lake.

A female was ovipositing in the water contained in a large bark groove of a felled Aspidosperma tree. Fringhtened away by unsuccessful attempts to photograph and catch it, it kept returning to this oviposition site, in a low flight over the ground: With reference tot earlier reports on pseudostigmatids breeding in phytotelmata, it is suggested that M.maculata might be a 'Kleingewasser” species rather than a bromelia breeder.

N2  - Odonate copulation is almost unique among the Pterygota in that the primary genitalia do not meet during copulation. Previous explanations concerning the evolution of the odonate copulatory process have been influenced by phylogenetic schemes which consider the narrow-winged Zygoptera the most generalized Odonata, However, fossil evidence and the comparative morphology of recent Odonata indicate that the broad-winged Zygoptera represent the most generalized Odonata among recent forms, supporting general evolutionary trends toward male domination of the copulatory process, and toward completion of the copulatory process in flight. One group of scenarios explaining the origin of the odonate copulatory process assumes the original direct transfer of sperm between primary genitalia. These scenarios require that oviposition originally be in tandem, and that sperm transfer to and from the male anterior abdominal sterna originally be accidental. Scenarios assuming the original indirect transfer of spermatophores as in the Apterygota avoid such problems, and lead to an original copulatory sequence which, when slightly modified, is essentially that of existing Odonata. The proposed scenario differs from those previously put forward in that extraordinary postures are not envisioned, the process is originally completed at rest, and development of the odonate tandem hold occurs just prior to sperm transfer. The tapdem hold is considered to have developed to prevent female predation of the male while the male guided her to his spermatophores.

N2  - The article mainly concerns the confused state of affairs existing in 2 out of 4 well-known yet wrongly interpreted species of Austroagrion. a genus centred in Australia but with 2 members occurring also outside the continent. The history of these is analysed and their correct status definitely established, using distinctive characters of structure and colour design, which are illustrated. An examination of the holotype of A. cyane (Selys), the type-species of the genus, revealed that it is conspecific with the West Australian A. coeruleum Tillyard, the last-mentioned name thus becoming a synonym of cyane. Inferentially, the species so far mistaken for cyane by all post-Selysian authors, is the widespread and locally common damselfly chiefly occurring in the eastern States of the continent. Consequently, this eastern opponent of A. cyane now requires a new name, for which watsoni, nom. nov., is here proposed as a substitute. The above explanation is followed by a new descriptive key to the identification of all 4 taxa so far known. After that, 3 of these species are briefly discussed, each supplied with a bibliography and locality lists of the material examined, A brief characterization is also given of a slightly aberrant population of A. watsoni, recently discovered in New Caledonia, a new element in the dragonfly fauna of that island.

Libellula americana Linnaeus was described from a figure in G. EDWARDS (1751, A natural history of birds, Vol.4, London), hence the reference to this work in the original diagnosis of L. fasciata is considered erroneous. The distinctive structural features of the males of the 3 spp. are figured, viz. the thoracic and wing patterns, the position of the ventral tooth of the superior appendages, and the penile organ. A figure of the ventral aspect of the abdomen of the Z. fasciata female is also provided.

N2  - In the early afternoon of January 21 a telephone call from the SIO National Office in the United States brought the incomprehensible message that our Monty is no more among us. Within a few hours this shocking news has spreadfrom the Editorial Office throughout the world. From Japan to Canada, from United States to Britain, from Germany to Holland, the leading odonatologists and the SIO Officers became speachless. With Monty's departure an epoch in odonatology came to a sudden conclusion... This epoch was characterized by the activities of our Society, the very roots of which are firmly anchored in Monty’s life-long philosophy of a "united odonatological community". Neither the International Odonatological Society, nor this or any other of its journals could ever have gained ground without Monty’s pioneer work in organizing the international odonatological community around his famous Purdue Colloquia of Odonatology, and, above all, through his S ELY SI A, the first truly international newsletter of Odonatology. In this, and in many other ways, Monty is the true "Father of SIO”.

Males briefly patrol about 15 m of shoreline and attempt to drive away any conspecific males. Females visit shoreline areas to oviposit in water overhung by shrubs. When detected by patrolling males, ovipositing females are grasped in tandem and the pair flies into the surrounding forest where copulation occurs.

N2  - Over 30 species of libellulids (18 genera) have been studied with particular reference to territoriality. Attempts to analyse territoriality are difficult because the approach adopted by individual investigators varies and thus their results may not be directly comparable. Furthermore, the range of territorial patterns is wide and their expression is complex and variable. The pattern of territoriality in a given species or individual is created by the interaction of, (1) spatial, (2) temporal and (3) biological factors. Within these three primary determinants influencing territoriality, many other, secondary factors operate with varying degrees of importance on the overall pattern. Also, tertiary and quaternary factors are often the ultimate means of determining a territorial pattern. Spatial factors include territory type, territory size, size of insect and population density. There is a continuum of variation between discrete territories and communal territories supporting a hierarchical group of individuals. Temporal factors include waterside (daytime) and roosting-site activity. Biological factors, particularly, are numerous and complicated, and include secondary levels labelled as residentiality, territorial activities (non-sexual) and sexual activities.

It is a dark-colored species related to G. exrernus but differing from that species and other Gomphurus in numerous structural and color-pattern features. It is peculiar in having abundant pruinosity on the head, thorax, legs and base of abdomen and is perhaps the most pruinose gomphid. Relationships among the species of Gomphurus are discussed and species pairs suggested. G. lynnae inhabits a large, rocky to muddy river in sagebrush steppe and is known to fly from 2 June to 18 July. It may be theatened because of its restricted range and the considerable human alteration of rivers in the Columbia Basin.

N2  - The mechanism of sex recognition in adult males of C. a. amurensis was studied in an experiment in which the movement patterns of intact and modified test individuals were manipulated. Patrolling males usually behave agonistically (i.e. attack and retreat) against an individual which rushes at them, without perceiving sexual differences in external morphology. On the other hand, such males respond sexually to (i.e. try to copulate with) an individual which makes swinging (egg-laying) or escape movements and which has an abdomen thick at the base. Sexual differences in external morphology are perceived after an approach has been made.

N2  - Preliminary observations were made on the territorial behaviour of 9 taxa of Megalagrion in the Hawaiian Islands, July — August 1982. M. vagabundum and M. oresitrophum, which breed in small streams, showed typical territorial behaviour: highest steady densities of 50 and 38 males per 100 m of water edge were recorded respectively. M. hawaiiense (Maui form) and M. pacificum are probably also territorial as may be M. blackburni. M. heterogamias and M. nigrohamatum, which spend much time perched on rocks in larger streams, showed aggressive behaviour but were either very weakly territorial or not at all. The form of M. hawaiiense in Hawaii, whose larva is probably semi-terrestrial, also appears to be non-territorial, M. amaurodytum peles appears not to defend the Astelia plants in which eggs are laid and in whose leaf axils the larvae develop. The size of territories in endemic Hawaiian Odonata appear to be proportional to size of insect.

N2  - Territorial behaviour of L. julia was studied at a sphagnum bog pond near Sherbrooke, Quebec. Canada. Males defend a 10—25 m length of shoreline by flying at, and chasing, conspecific males. Feeding was not seen to occur in these territories. Females visit shoreline areas to oviposit in water under the overhanging vegetation and males attempt to mate with any females they encounter at the oviposition sites. Following brief, aerial copulation, females resume ovipositon and are guarded by the males who hover nearby and attempt to drive away conspecific males.

N2  - Observations on an A. affinis population breeding at a temporary pond of Central Italy are reported. Males showed territorial behaviour for less than 3 h over the same area, from which they would chase other males. Females began to oviposit as soon as they came to the pond in the morning, without immediately preceding copulation. Holes dug in the dried-up ground of the pond by wild boars were chiefly utilized as oviposition sites. Tandem formation and intra-male sperm translocation (the latter always closely following the former) took place at the pond and were followed by copulation. Then the pair began to oviposit while still in tandem. After some time the male released the female, who went on ovipositing alone. In the evening, after having been away from the pond, males and females returned and performed the hunting (light, during which they did not show any aggressive or sexual behaviour.

N2  - The occurrence of guarding of non-mates by males of C. maculata appears to be a function of population density. Males in a high density Canadian population regularly defend females with whom they have not copulated, unlike males in a low density Virginian population (cf. J. ALCOCK, 1979, J. nut. Hist. 13: 439-446). But males in Canadian and other high density populations that are guarding mates (and non-mates) do occasionally respond sexually to new arrivals on their territories whereas repeat matings between a male and a recent partner are very rare. Both males and females apparently change their receptivity in response to several factors producing a variety of possible interactions between a territory owner and an arriving female. The interchange of signals between a pair leads males to copulate primarily with new partners.

N2  - Larval I. cervula are aggressive towards conspecifics and exclude them from areas of food concentration. The effects of hunger, previous interactions, and familiarity with an area on dominance of larvae were determined. Dominance was defined as the ability of one animal to supplant another. At low levels of hunger (starved for 3 or 6 days) dominance of hungry animals was not significantly different from that of well-fed animals. At higher hunger levels (starved for 9 or 12 days) hungry animals were less dominant. Animals previously matched with a large animal tended to be less dominant than animals previously matched with a smaller animal. Dominance of animals moved from familiar areas to unfamiliar areas was not significantly different from dominance of animals allowed to remain in familiar areas. Thus, differences in hunger and outcome of previous interactions will help maintain the exclusion while familiarity with an area will have no effect.

Most (82%) of the threatened spp. are associated with flowing water. The loss of high-quality, undisturbed streams is the most significant factor endangering odonates in the US and Canada. The threatened spp. occur in 3 eastern Canadian Provinces and in 31 states, most of which are east of the Mississippi River. There is no one small area where conservation efforts could be marshalled for the simultaneous protection of more than one narrow endemic sp. However, the southeastern Highlands and the southern Gulf Coast are considered important for future conservation efforts.

N2  - The behaviour of marked individuals of O. chrysostigma was observed at a small stream during 15 days in July, 1982, at Hunter’s Lodge, Kenya. In a 30 m length of stream there were normally 3 resident males. 2 of which held the same territories throughout the study period. Further males visited the stream intermittently, acting as wanderers or as satellites to resident males, and showing much less spatial constancy than residents. Females appeared at the stream at a mean rate of 0.34 per half-hour throughout each 7-hour "day". One territorial male obtained 44% of all observed copulations (total 27), while 37% of the copulations were shared between about 15 satellites and wanderers. Territorial males copulated 9 times as often as nonterritorial males but copulation in the latter lasted up to 17 times longer. The possible significance of long and short copulations for sperm competition is considered.

N2  - A colony of O. coerulescens was observed in southern England during July, 1980. Detailed analyses of territoriality were carried out by noting the type, duration and temporal distribution of 1323 territorial flights of 7 adult males. Territorial attachment varied according to age and from individual to individual. Up to 14 territories (7-16 m in length; mean 10.5 m were established along 154 m of small stream. Territorial males spent between 4 and 19% of their time in flight (mean 13%). Territorial flight activities were complex and often incorporated a number of different components. The dominant flight activities involved feeding (53% of flights and 12% of flight time), patrolling (40% and 61%) and aggression (17% and 18%). Aggression and patrolling were frequently associated as combined activities. Feeding, if combined, was mostly linked with patrolling. About 75% of feeding. 33% of patrolling and 25% of aggressive flights were unassociated with any other components. The mean durations of uncombined feeding, aggressive and patrolling flights were 2.7. 12.0 and 17.8 sec respectively. Other night components (minor changes of position; stabilizing; disturbance; various types associated with reproductive behaviour) collectively comprised only 7% of the total night time. Territoriality often commenced at about 10.30 BST, but was weather determined. Patrolling and aggressive (lights were at a maximum around 12.30 hr, whereas feeding was maximised early in the morning territorial period and from 16.00-17.00 hr. Copulatory activity was observed on nine occasions (12.42-17.50 hr), when copulations ranged from 5 sec to nearly 25 min, with a mean of 7 min 11.5 sec. Mature non-territorial males ("wanderers") were seen frequently on occupied territories.

N2  - The reproductive ethogram of C. lindeni is described. Males may show territorial as well as non-territorial behaviour. The tandem position may be assumed either with the female in flight or when perched. One or both members in tandem may display to approaching individuals; a magnification of the warning signal is supposed to result from both members of a pair displaying at the same time. Intra-male sperm translocation occurred while the tandem pairs were perched and preceded copulation. It is suggested that cooperation of the female in the successful forming of the wheel may be caused by a reflex response to the stimulation of her prothorax by the male cerci. Exceptionally a female will copulate twice a day. Surface oviposition is chiefly performed in tandem, seldom by unaccompanied females. If the female tends to complete submersion, the male will drag her out of water and shift to another site. In some circumstances, however, he loses his grip on the female prothorax, leadingto the female continuing underwater oviposition alone. Occasionally an emerging female is seized again by her previous mate.

N2  - A year-long program of qualitative sampling at Howard Creek, Oconee County, South Carolina, yielded data on instar sizes and the pattern of larval growth for L vernalis. Head-width size ranges were determined for the last 7 instars. In the final instar, female larvae were larger than male larvae. No final-instar larvae were collected from the stream from April through June. Apparently no penultimate larvae reached the final instar during the early summer. This gap in occurrence of final instars corresponds to the flight season based on literature records from South and North Carolina. Final-instar larvae present from mid-summer on appear to overwinter rather than emerge. The lack of a clear pattern in larval growth implies a mixed vollinism. It is suggested that L. vernalis is at least semivoltine with the possibility that some larvae take longer to develop in this cool, unproductive stream.

The ultimate instar and the 5 preceding instars were distinguished biometrically and morphologically. A detailed description of the ultimate instar, including scanning E M. micrographs, is presented. By a morphological comparison with P. cognatus (Ramb,, 1842), P. genei (Sel., 1841) and P. lineatus (Sel., 1850). it is shown that the structure of the prementum and of the last antennal segment are highly diagnostic. It appears that P. sinaiticus is more closely related to P. genei than to other spp. Some remarks on the larval habitat are also provided.

The embryonic development was completed in 217-239 days, at a mean temperature of 10,8° C. The process is briefly described. A diapause stage took place immediately prior to blastokinesis. All eggs hatched within 22 days, showing a high degree of synchronisation. — The newly hatched larvae were reared in tubes in a garden pond. Ten instars were observed. The average body lenght increment per moult was proportionately constant at 27% approx. The larval growth could be well described in terms of a power law. The mean specific growth rate, which ranged from 0.8 to 1.8% lenght increment day-1, is compared with the growth rates of other Sympetrum spp. The lifecycle of.

N2  - Hatching success and rate of embryonic development were measured at 7 constant temperatures in the laboratory and in 5 natural ponds in western Virginia, USA. Hatching success in the lab was reduced at low temperatures for P. lydia and at high temperatures for A. tuberculifera. These results are consistent with the phenologies and geographical distributions of these spp. Hyperbolic functions accurately described the affects of temperature on the logarithmic rate of embryogenesis for both spp. in the laboratory but temperature appeared to have little influence on either hatching success or embryogenic rate in the field. Thus other environmental factors must have accounted for the variation which existed among ponds in both hatching success and rate of embryonic development. Circumstantial evidence suggests that oxygen level may have been the important limiting factor in the ponds investigated in this study.

N2  - Close to JO populations pertaining to C. servilia s.I. from India, Nepal, Thailand. Singapore, continental China, the Philippines, Taiwan and Japan were examined cytologically. The type locality of the sp. is "China”, and its karyotypic morphology is uniform throughout continental Asia, the Philippines and Taiwan (2n<5 = 25, n$ = 13. m. XO). The Japanese material, which has been for a long time noticed for the "usually distinctly large size" of the individuals, is essentially distinct from all other populations, deviating from these in chromosome number (2n $ = 24, n$ = 12) and in mode of sex determination (neo-XY). Since these features are geographically limited to Japan, consistently expressed in all individuals examined, not subject to variation among individuals, do not show intrinsic genetic variability, and are not conditioned by the environment, the Japanese population is separated under the name C. servilia mariannae ssp. n. The type scries originates from Osaka, and all material examined is of Honshu provenience. This is the first case of erection of a new taxon in the Odonata on the basis of karyomorphological diagnostic characters.

N2  - Dear Maus, On February 4, 1970you put your signature on the Invitation Circular that the three of us were to send out to the Dutch odonatologists, inviting them to an informal meeting to take place in Utrecht, on March 7 of the same year. None of us could have dreamt then that this "First Colloquium of Dutch Dragonfly Workers" was to inspire the birth of our "dragonfly family". It took but 19 months after that date for SIO to be formally constituted in Ghent and within hardly a decade it was destined to become the largest specialized entomological society, with membership in over 60 countries throughout the globe. As you know, one of the very first moves of the Society, within the first 10 minutes of its existence, right there in Ghent, was to award you the MEMBERSHIP OF HONOUR. At the same lime, your first forma! service to the Society was your suggestion to set up an ABSTRACTING SERVICE through Odonalologica. We cannot recollect now which of these two motions was passed first, but we can certainly assure you that both of them are considered by the odonatologists throughout the world among the most fortunate and fit ting motions ever passed by SIO.

N2  - From equatorial Uganda and southern Canada the behaviour and reproductive condition of migrating Anisoptera are described. In neither situation was sexual activity seen among migrating adults. In Uganda, a very large Bight of Anisoptera, predominantly Hemianax ephippiger, descended at sunset from a great height, roosted overnight and then left at sunrise. Females among these H. ephippiger were unmated, very immature reproductivcly, and richly endowed with abdominal fat. They, and 2 other spp. accompanying them, probably began migrating in the early post-teneral stage. In Canada, aggregations of Anisoptera. mainly Anax Junius, were observed as they roosted in Aug. and Sept, on their way south. Adult A. junius roost on west-facing vegetation but exhibit a brief, pre-sunrise adjustment flight by which they move to east-facing perches that relatively quickly become warm. It is suggested that not only migrants may benefit from such a translocation early in the morning; moreover it may be useful for orientation during migration, whether or not it is necessitated by low ambient temperature. All (female) Tramea lacerata. ulmost all A. junius and most Pantala flavescens examined from these aggregations were immature reproductively and almost all Sympetrum vicinum were mature. Abdominal fat correlates moderately well with ovarian immaturity in A. iuniux but not in the .1 other spp, examined.

N2  - Melanesobasis gen. nov. is created for 3 described spp. of Nesobasis and 4 new spp„ which are described and illustrated here. The genotype is M. corniculata (Till.), which is widespread in the Fijian Islands (Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Kadavu, Koro, Ovalau, Taveuni, and Rabi); additional spp. are flavilabris (Set.) (Viti levu), simmondsi (Till.) (Viti Levu, Kadavu), and the new spp. maculosa sp. n. (Viti Levu), mcleani sp. n. (Viti Levu), prolixa sp. n. (Moala), and bicellulare sp. n. (Maewo, Vanuatu), The northern population (Vanua Levu, Rabi, Taveuni, and Koro) of M. corniculala is recognized on coloration and structural grounds as a distinct ssp. marginata ssp. n. — The genus is related to Nesohasis. but is distinguished by its relatively large inferior appendages in the male, the dark color of the images, and the labial palp of the larva lacking in setae. Other characters for distinguishing the two genera are denser venation, longer legs and leg spines, and a recumbent hind lobe of the pronotum. The undulant wing margin suggests a relationship with the Platycnemididae, with the Solomon Islands genus Lieftinckia being a possible annectant. This relationship appears to confuse the relationship between the Coenagrionidae and the Platycnemididae and suggests that the former may be polyphyletic.

ASAH1NA, at present Guest Scientist at the National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Charter Member, Member of Honour and Past President of the International Odonatological Society, and Editor of Tomba – Acta odonalologica, (including a list of taxa dedicated to him) is followed by an annotated checklist of new names of taxa and forms'he has described or proposed in insects (108 in the Odonata), and by his entomological bibliography (1928-1983; 632 titles, inch 376 on the Odonata). Most of his odonatological work is devoted to taxonomy and to the sino-japanese and oriental fauna. We are honoured to write this short appreciation of Dr Syoziro Asahina on the occasion of his 70th birthday. He might well be called the "Father of odonatology in Japan”, and most of the present generation of dragonfly workers in Japan have been brought up under his influence or with his guidance.

The main structural difference between larval and adult tubules is the presence of elongate mitochondria inserted into the luminal microvilli of the adults. This correlates with an increase in the basal rate of fluid secretion by the adult tubules, which is some 3-4 times higher than in the larvae.

N2  - Two forms of M. p. pruinosa males occur in the study area (Ino river, Japan), viz. f. esakii and f. strigata. Territorial behaviour between strigata and esakii males is initiated only by the latter, and usually leads to displacement of slrigala. The behaviour of slrigala males in the absence of esakii. was observed following removal of esakii males from the experimental area. M. p. p. strigata males established territories, and drove away other intruding slrigala. They also showed the same reproductive behaviour (except courtship) as esakii males when females appeared in the territory. The mean frequencies of copulations observed for slrigala males under natural and experimental conditions were 1.0 ± 1.2 (95% confidence limits) times and 1.1 ± 1.1 times per 20 min, respectively. This suggests, therefore, that the frequency of copulations for slrigala does not increase when esakii males are removed. The pre- and post- copulatory mating strategies of both esakii and strigata males are discussed.

N2  - The organization of the repeated and single-copy DNA sequences in the genomes of 2 odon. spp. from different suborders was studied. Three types of experiments were performed, viz. (1) comparison of the reassociation kinetics of short (200 nucleotides) and long (700-900 nucleotides) DNA fragments, (2) measurement of the hyperchromicity of the reassociated repeated sequences as a function of fragment length, and (3) sizing S, nuclease-resistant reassociated repeated sequences. The data indicate that in the genomes of dragonflies only a part of repeats are interspersed with single-copy sequences in a " Xenopus pattern" and that mostly they are organized in a ”Drosophila pattern". Consequently, one can hardly speak of a definite type of genome organization; it may differ depending on the genome size.

N2  - Arguments are presented for the 3 generally recognized taxa of the genus Mnais Selys occurring in the Japanese Islands to be regarded as independent spp., viz. M. costalis Selys, M. pruinosa Selys, and M. nawai Yamamoto. It is pointed out that the M. pruinosa populations occurring in central Honshu (the Setouchi Group) are also possibly an independent sp. to be distinguished from those occurring in southwestern Japan (the Nankai and Saikai Groups). Essentially the same combination of forms (a heterochromatic orange-winged, occasionally pale-orangeor dark-brown-winged male, a homoeochromatic hyaline-winged male, and a homoeochromatic hyaline-winged female) seems to occur in most districts of the Japanese Islands. Based on the taxonomic arrangement of the known forms, the evolution of the Japanese Mnais spp. is discussed. The present geographic distribution of the taxa and the combination of forms in various districts are interpreted by a working hypothesis based on the so-called "competitive exclusion (or displacement) principle" and a consequent "character displacement”.

The dragonfly selected, at the stream, nearly always the liverwort Conocephalum conicum as the host plant for oviposition, which grew close to the stream in shaded environment. The trace of oviposition was detected only in healthy thalli, and a high egg density was observed in thalli of a rather small-sized colony of the liverwort. The significance of these observations is discussed in relation to larval development.

N2  - Visually released responses to a rival male were studied in territorial males of 5. sanguineum, S. vulgatum, S. flaveolum and S. pedemontanum using a fishing-rod to present synthetic models. Film discs with the dark body centre and the concentric wing spot (if necessary) turned out to be most effective. Position and presence of the abdomen made no difference. The species devoid of wing patterns (S. sanguineum, S. vulgalum, S. danae) are unable to recognize each other by appearance. Probably, they utilize other means of interspecific isolation. The species decorated with wing spots certainly distinguish conspecific males by the specific feature of pattern: an orange pericentral fleck in 5. flaveolum, a subapical band in S. pedemonlanum. The wing pattern shows stronger Contrast in UV than in long wave rays. S. sanguineum showed moderate aggression against patterned models, but was less selective to various models than the two patterned species. The properties of the neural perceptor detecting the configurational visual stimulus are discussed. Distant recognition of the conspecific mate by its pattern is more reliable if the latter is restricted to basal or apical flecks and bands, while thawing middle remains clear. Most odonate species with wing decoration support this rule.

N2  - Egg release rates at different abdomen temperatures were determined for 2 populations of Erythemis simplicicollis (Say) by submerging females’ abdomens in vials of water of known temperature and timing the durations of egg flow. The log of flow rate increased linearly with increasing abdomen temperature in both New York and Florida (N=29 and N=62 respectively) from 18 to approximately 38° C above which flow rates decreased or ceased. Significant differences were found in the slopes and elevations of the regression of log egg flow on temperature for the two populations, the N.Y. females releasing eggs from 67% to 8% faster than the Florida females between 20 and 38° C respectively. The Q,0 of flow rate with temperature was 1.8 for the N.Y. females, and 2.2 for the Florida population. Comparing lOspp. in the Libellulidae, egg flow rate at a given temperature increased significantly with increasing body size.

N2  - Larval populations of Tetragoneuria cynosura. Celithemis elisa, C. fasciata, and Sympetrum vicinum coexist in allochthonous detritus habitats of Bays Mountain Lake (Sullivan County, Tennessee, U.S.A.). Their diets were described by fecal pellet analysis to determine whether size differences among larval cohorts reduced dietary overlap within seasons. Differences in larval development time within this assemblage resulted in considerable size overlap among co-occurring larvae. Some species-specific differences in diet were found (e.g., T. cynosura tended tn concentrate on insect prey, while S. vicinum took more microcrustaceans); but there was considerable dietary overlap among species within seasons. Most ate. a disproportionate number of medium-sized cladocerans, ostracods, oligochaetes, burrowing and climbing midges, trichopterans and odonates. Fewer copepods, large and small cladocerans, and sprawling midges were eaten than might have been expected from estimates of prey abundance. The similarities out-weighed the differences, such that niche-overlap indices (Hurlbert's were always greater than 1.0 (range 2.4 to 8.7). — A comparison of diets among larvae within species found no consistent reduction of dietary overlap among instars. Larger inslars were often more specialized due to predation on relatively rare large prey (e.g.. odonate and trichopteran larvae), but they did not omit smaller items (e.g.. chydorid cladocerans and ostracods) from their diets. Thus smaller instars experienced relatively high niche overlap with their larger conspecifics, — The incidence of mutual predation among odonate larvae was very high during seasons when very small instars coexisted with large ones. The increase in this ultimate form of "interference" competition may be a more important consequence of seasonal segregation of life histories than reduced "exploitation" competition due to reduction of dietary niche overlap.

N2  - Sexually mature male and female S. depressiusculum were observed in large swarms throughout the day at or near rice fields in the Camargue, southern France, in July, 1983. Males became active 19 min before sunrise when they formed tandems with roosting females. Tandem pairs remained perching on rice plants and adjacent grass with only occasional changes of position for 2'/,-3 hours, after which copulation and oviposition commenced. No territorial behaviour or other interaction between single males was observed, but on a few occasions single males were seen unsuccessfully to attempt to seize females in tandem. Many further pairs in tandem flew into the rice fields from neighbouring meadows throughout the morning; they either rested or commenced to copulate and oviposit soon after arrival. Copulations were commonly preceded by dipping movements which resembled aerial oviposition in other species but were without egg release. Dipping may enable females to verify the presence of an oviposition site, before accepting copulation. Unsuccessful attempts to copulate were frequently followed by further dipping. Postcopulatory dipping may represent attempts by the male to initiate oviposition. After about 13:30 h, little or no reproductive activity was seen and both sexes joined in the immense feeding swarms which built up over the rice fields until dusk. Intense competition for females may explain the prolonged phase of pre-copulatory guarding (tandem formation) in a species in which both sexes remain abundant at or near the oviposition sites throughout the day. but in which females are willing to oviposit only during the later part of the morning.

N2  - Female O. chrysostigma possess a very small bursa able to hold only about 26% of the sperm stored in this species, the remainder being contained in the long, narrow spermathecae. The male has a penis with a long barbed flagellum which may be able to enter and reach the distal ends of the spermathecae. It may hook out the sperm of other males from the storage organs of the female during the long copulations sometimes seen in this species. In contrast, in N. farinosa, a sympatric species of similar size and colour, the female storage organs can contain over a hundred times more sperm than in O. chrysusligma: about 83% of it being kept in the bursa. This species makes relatively short copulations, and the male has a penis whose structure suggests that it compresses pre-existing sperm in the bursa but cannot enter the spermathecae. One male O. chrysusligma carries enough sperm in the secondary genitalia to furnish about 6 females, whereas one female N. farinusa has stores large enough to contain the contributions of about 6 males. In both species, towards the end of copulation new sperm is probably injected through a bursal valve, whereas during fertilisation sperm leaves the bursa through a small posterior pore under muscular control.

N2  - The life-cycle of C. hastulatum was studied in southern (58° 42'N) and northern (67° 5074) Sweden. In the southern area, the life cycle duration was 1-2 yr. The univoltine and semivoltine larvae separated as cohorts already before the first winter. During the second summer, the semivoltine cohort continued to develop slowly, while larvae that had overwintered in the last 3 instars, i.e. the univoltine cohort and older semivoltine larvae, rapidly proceeded to emergence, which mainly took place in June. Egg development was direct. In the northern area, the life-cycle duration was 3-4 yr, and almost all larvae overwintered in the final instar before emergence. A very low frequency of penultimate instars in the overwintering population seemed to be generated during the late part of the third summer by a cohort splitting suggestive of the one in the southern area. Experiments performed at different photoperiods partly explained the life-cycle pattern. Larvae overwintering below a certain critical size, associated with the frequency minimum produced by the cohort splitting, showed a slow development at subsequent long-day photoperiods, in particular in the penultimate instar. Larvae overwintering above the critical size rapidly proceeded to emergence under the same conditions. A 19,3 hr daylength produced a long-day response in the southern population only. The shorter days of September (southern population) produced a burst of moulting activity before a hibernation diapause, present in at least the 3 last instars, was induced. The winter critical size was concluded not to be a result of the previous cohort splitting, which was assumed to be under separate environmental control. The early cohort separation may serve to reduce intraspecific competition and to add further refinement to seasonal regulation.

N2  - The larval growth was monitored in 3 separate populations. L. sponsa typically has 10 instars; larval life lasted from between 68 and 83 days. The sex ratio is close to equality initially, becomes male biased, but is female biased at emergence. Females enter the final instar before males. The population with the fastest growth also showed the greatest degree of synchrony and produced significantly larger larvae than the other populations. It is suggested that food availability accounts for these differences.

It apparently belongs to the C. boltoni-group (which also includes C. insignis, C. coronatus, etc.), and not to the C. bidentatus-”group”, as is still widely believed. The dichotomy within Cordulegaster is in fact so deep, that it seems unavoidable to remove the bidenlalus-group from that genus and accomodate it closer to Anotogaster.

N2  - The genus Nehalennia Selys is revised and redefined. It is demonstrated that Argiallagma Calvert is a synonym of Nehalennia Sel. The Brazilian N. selysi Kirby is redescribed and assigned to minuta Sel., as a subspecies. A lectotype is designated ($: Sao Joao del Key, Minas Gerais, Brazil; Coll. Selys, Inst. R. Sc. Nat. Belg., Brussels). The genus is closely related to other genera with an angulate Irons. It actually includes six species and one subspecies, which are tentatively arranged into a "phylogenetic tree”, based on differences and similarities of morphological characters (larval and adult). The penes and the male anal appendages of all species are figured. A new interpretation of the superior appendages is given and a terminology for both the superiors and the inferiors is proposed. Figures of the female prothorax of all species are provided, as well as drawings of other important structures and colour patterns. For the seven taxa a list of synonyms is given. In the case of N. minuta and pallidula Calv. a more exhaustive bibliography is added. Measures and venational features (males) are presented, as well as a description of the habitat preferences and dates on the distribution.

N2  - The larval photoperiodic responses at 15° and 20° C, and, to a limited extent, the larval development in the field, were examined in a population of L. dubia from N of the Arctic Circle. The results were compared with similar data from a S Swedish population. In the latter, the life cycle duration was 3 years; in the northern population it was probably longer. The basic effects of photoperiod on development were of the same type in both populations. Larvae in at least the 4 instars preceding the final one showed a simple photoperiodic reaction of the long-day type, and a hibernation diapause was induced by short days. A long-day diapause starting in the early part of the final instar, and a short-day diapause chiefly effective at a later interecdysis stage in the same instar, ensure that emergence is restricted to the spring, and that most larvae spend the last winter before emergence in a suitably advanced stage within the final instar. The remaining final instar development is stimulated by the long days during the spring. Larvae overwintering in pre-final instars normally enter diapause in the final instar. The differences between the populations are primarily related to the photoperiodic regime and the length of the summer in the respective areas. Compared to the southern population, the northern population displays a 4-6 hours longer critical daylength, a generally weaker diapause in the final instar, and somewhat different responses in the penultimate instar. Northern larvae often showed responses typical for short days at LD 21.5:2.5 and (in particular in the penultimate instar, and at 15° C) at continuous light. The induction of hibernation diapause in the penultimate instar is thus likely to occur early in the northern population, thereby restricting the entry into the final instar to the early part of the season. Thereafter, the weaker final instar diapause of the northern larvae permits them to spend their last winter in a more uniform and advanced state than the larvae in the southern population despite the shorter summers. This produces an early, brief emergence period believed to be essential for L. dubia in N Sweden. In the southern population a later entry into the final instar is produced by the different response pattern of the penultimate instar: long days produce a slight prolongation of development, and the short-day (hibernation) diapause is less readily induced than in the preceding instars. When a potentially dangerous ’last minute" entry into the final instar occurs in the autumn, it leads to overwintering in an early interecdysis stage and a certain delay in emergence, but it pays off by a shorter development than with an early induction of penultimate instar diapause.

N2  - Larvae of I. verticalis reared under laboratory conditions have 4 different growing types, characterized by 9, 10, 11 and 12 instars respectively. This paper is concerned with the morphology of larval forms for individuals of the 10- -instar type, the most common type of development. Morphological characteristics such as antennae, labium, metathoracic legs, gonapophyses and caudal lamellae are principally used in the description of the different instars. Also included is a comparative study of the variability of major morphological structures for the four growing types.

N2  - Immersion of larvae in various external salinities indicates a sound ability to maintain the haemolymph ionic balance. Removal'of the pars intercerebralis region of the brain and ligature at the neck region do not provide any indication of involvement of the hormones of the brain and other endocrine organs of the cephalic region. Destruction of the thoracic ganglia apparently creates an imbalance in the concentrations of sodium and potassium in the haemolymph, suggesting the thoracid ganglia as a source of a hormonal factor controlling ionic balance. The regulation of internal ionic balance under hormonal influence of thoracic ganglia has become evident from the experiments performed during the present study.

N2  - Field experiments at Castel Porziano, Rome, Italy, have shown that L. barbarus populations are highly philopatric, their return to their native ponds being based on homing behaviour. Some ponds lacking any barbarus may prove suitable for larval growth up to emergence, but precocious drying up would often cause the extinction of larvae. Short-range dispersal is so scarce that colonization of non-populated ponds is not promptly obtained.

N2  - The sequence of mating behavior usually described in the literature (tandem, sperm translocation, copulation) is accurate for species of the zygopteran genera Lestes, Nehalennia, Calopteryx, Platycypha, and Chlorocypha. Species of the genera Enallagma, Argia, Amphiagrion, Ischnura, Anomalagrion, and Hetaerina exhibit an additional step between tandem and sperm translocation, here called ’’genital touching”. After tandem formation, the male invites copulation and the female briefly touches her genitalia to his accessory genitalia, whereupon he translocates sperm. Genital touching may allow males to determine female receptivity prior to filling of the sperm vesicle. Data on duration of sperm translocation are also presented.

(holotype $, allotype $, Mus. Zool., Univ, Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; LaMerced, Junin Dept, Peru, 13-VI-1931), is analyzed, and these spp. are redescribed and figured. Body color pattern, male abdominal appendages, and female mesostigmal lamina are too similar to be of taxonomic value. Males are differentiated on length and shape of penis horns and on wing color pattern, females only on the latter. Analysis of these characteristics showed much interdemic variation, but it was either insufficient to meet the 90% joint non overlap criterion or too discordant for the erection of new subspecies. F.C. FRASER’s (1946, Trans. R. enl. Soc. Land. 96: 11-46) "races”, adjuncta, ambigua, and originata are invalid, but his "race”, terminata is given full specific status.

N2  - N. pentacantha was reared in the laboratory from egg to adult in one year, and had 14 or 15 larval instars. Instar 2 differs from all other Nearctic Aeshnidae by having 2 pairs of horns on the head. Instars 3-15'differ from all other Nearctic Aeshnidae by having mid-dorsal abdominal spines on at least segments 8 and 9. Stadia duration decreases from instars 2 to 4, then increases to 7, then decreases at 8, then increases to possible diapause in late instars. Male larvae died at a faster rate than females (p <0.01), so that by instar 15 only 37.5% of the survivors were males. Growth rates for both head width and total body length varied cyclically, with maxima at instars 4, 9, and 15 and minima at instars 2, 6, and 12. Certain morphological changes between instars are described.

The change occurs over a period of about 2 to 3 weeks in Gainesville, Florida. Males marked within a few hours of emergence were either released or placed in a large outdoor flight cage. Caged individuals were hand fed daily with different amounts of prey. The rate at which a male’s colors matured decreased both with decreasing food consumption and declining average air temperatures. A method is described for estimating the postemergence age of reproductively mature males from their color patterns upon arrival at a pond.

The evaluation is based on 5 verifiable status/abundance classes of the taxa recorded, which are assumed to represent a set of probability classes, verifiable under defined conditions. The RSO can also be used for the characterization of an individual habitat by its odonate fauna, and for bioindication of the habitat condition as required for conservation and adequate management.

N2  - The interspecific and ontogenetic variations in the larval distribution of Aeshna cyanea, Anax imperator and Libellula depressa were estimated on the basis of monthly samples in a pond in Brittany, France. The aeshnids co-occurred, but L. depressa usually inhabits the shallow parts only. The younger A. cyanea instars tend to congregate. In the FO and F-l aeshnid instars, the spatial overlap index decreases from April to May. No relationship between larval age and water depth could be evidenced.

Selys, Brussels) and H. smaragdalis sp. n. (holotype $■. road Manrique-La Sierra, 425 m, Cojedes, Venezuela, 28-1-1983; Facultad de Agronomia, Maracay). Males and females of both species, and the larva of H. capitalis are described and figured. The most important characters for separating the adults are the shape of the superior anal appendages in the male and the colour of the thoracic stripes in the female. Several additional features, e.g. wing venation, length of the pterostigma, body size, colour of upper front and clypeus, and habitat preferences may also be useful to separate these two sibling species. A complete bibliography, distributional map, and some observations on the biology of H. capitalis are also provided.

N2  - Eggs were hatched in the laboratory and larvae reared to the final instar. Three developmental types were recognized (12, 13 and 14 instars) and there was a positive correlation between growth rate, final size, number of instars and temperature between 15 and 25° C. These factors, plus intra-instar variation, allow only the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and final instars to be identified with certainty. The number of antennomeres, metathoracic wing pad length, and head width were useful in assigning larvae to instar. Head width growth ratios decreased as larvae grew; the average growth ratio was 1.24.

N2  - Some general remarks are made on the types of the spp. brought by Selys under his sub-genus Protoneura, emphasizing the difficulty in identifying most of these spp. with the data available. The types of the Selysian spp. exigua, tenuissima and capilliformis were examined and lectotypes designated for the first 2 of these. Protoneura exigua was shown to be conspecific with Phasmoneura olmyra Wllmsn, 1916 and thus becomes the type species of the genus Phasmoneura Williamson. The position of tenuissima as a true Psaironeura was confirmed and Psaironeura cerasina Wllmsn, 1915 was made a synonym of E. capilliformis (Sel., 1886). Remarks were made on the morphology of the three species with the aim of correcting mistakes found in the literature and facilitating their identification.

N2  - The observations were carried out at a hill stream, Sagar District, Madhya Pradesh, India. Territoriality was strongly demonstrated by males which also exhibited precopulatory courtship by "wing display” before assuming the tandem position. Intra-male sperm transfer occurred after the seizure of the female and lasted for 18.8 sec. The copulatory wheel was formed in the perched condition and was maintained for 4.1 min, during which insemination took place. After disruption of the wheel position, the tandem pair performed postcopulatory exploratory flights which lasted for 20.8 min. The sensory styles of the ovipositor valvulae helped in the exploration of suitable sites and materials. Oviposition occurred in tandem and lasted for 20.3 min. The eggs were laid irregularly and exophytically among the algal mass and were covered by a gelatinous investment.

N2  - The main question about the little-known process of sperm translocation in anisopteran males, is whether sperm translocation is performed by the male alone and/or "in tandem". Systematic observations of the pairing in C. erythraea and O. cancellatum, from male-female seizure till starting of copulation, revealed that sperm translocation always occurred following tandem formation. The sequence (tandem seizure — sperm translocation — copulation) is suggested to be a behavioural chain in which each phase takes a rigid position. On this basis, the "in tandem" sperm translocation is considered to be the normal behaviour, while sperm translocation in the male alone is suggested to be anomalous.

All spp. found are shown to tolerate moderate natural mineralization of water in the absence of man-originated pollution. Results are compared with data for the nearby Topino River, which is more polluted, and with some other streams. Calopteryx splendens appears to be of little utility as a biological indicator, but other odon. spp. may be useful.

These animals were uniquely marked with a number on the left hindwing and a spot of paint on the thorax. Females emerged on average 1.4 days earlier than males, but had a longer immature period {16.5 days compared with 13.2 days). Males were twice as likely as females to return to the emergence site to breed. The sex ratio at emergence was not significantly different from unity. (50.96% males). The mean mature adult lifespan was 5.6 days in males and 5.4 days in females. Most individuals of both sexes breed at only one breeding site.

N2  - During April, 1984, T. tillarga were observed to be highly active at Hunter’s Lodge, Kenya, from 0.6:20 to 07:00 (sunrise: 06:28) and from 16:30 to 18:45 h (sunset:18:32 h). At other times they were probably resting in dense vegetation. In the evening, males flew continuously within limited areas along the water margin, never perching but hovering with increasing frequency as the light intensity diminished. Hovers were made over green leaves of Typha, Cyperus and Sparganium which were floating horizontally at the water surface, and onto which females oviposited epiphytically. A female oviposited by making a series of downwards swoops onto a leaf; when guarded by a male she remained ovipositing onto the same leaf, making a swoop every 1.32 ± 0.36 s (s.d), but when unguarded she visited a succession of different leaves, making a swoop every 2.06 ± 1,03 s (s.d.). Many eggs were eaten by fish soon after being laid, but this ceased once they had become firmly stuck to a leaf. The frequent switching between leaves by unguarded females may have helped to reduce egg predation. Guarded females did not switch between leaves, possibly because of the risk of being lost by their guards particularly in dim light. Eggs were laid in discrete batches of about 9, each egg being orientated in the batch with its anterior pole facing outwards. The eggs were covered in a thick network of spumaline which stuck them firmly to the leaf but allowed contact between the water and the chorion. The female is equipped with an egg basket, a structure on the 9th abdominal sternite in which eggs are probably stacked and orientated prior to each downward swoop. It is estimated that at 28-30° C eggs were laid at 405 min'1 when the female was guarded, and at 261 min'1 when not guarded. About 44-66 batcnes comprised a clutch, and thus 400-600 eggs could be laid in one bout of oviposition.

N2  - In the study area 2 forms of M. p. pruinosa males (f. esakii and f. strigata) occurred. Immature damselflies dispersed away from the stream. After maturation they returned to the stream and often moved along the stream searching for territory sites. Once esakii males established their territories, strigata males stettled around these territories as satellites. The males of esakii had many mating chances, utilizing their territories. Male movements and settlement were influenced by fighting among the males and also by the frequency of female appearances. Both esakii and strigata males aggregated in the habitat sections where many females appeared. Mating strategies of esakii and strigata males are described as territorial-guarding and satellite-multicopulation (nonguarding), respectively. A possible mechanism for coexistence of both types of males is suggested.

N2  - Males of C. diadema are not territorial; instead they patrol long routes by streams in southeastern Arizona. Certain stream segments are visited sporadically by many different males. Females rarely appear at water and receptive females are rarer still. Males capture receptive females in flight, copulate while perched for periods of about 2 hr, after which their mates are released to oviposit unguarded. The significance of the correlation between prolonged copulation and non-territorial patrolling, which occurs in this and other unrelated dragonflies, remains to be fully understood.

Differences between this larva and those of its closest Nearctic relatives, S. albicincta and S. hudsonica, are outlined and a key to the larvae of the alpestris group of Somatochlora is provided. S. sahlbergi is an amphi-Beringian species, distributed across northern Asia in a band near the northern limit of trees, but in North America is found only in the extreme northwest. It is usually found in deep, cold, mossy ponds. Examination of larval morphometries indicates a four to five year maturation period. In the northern Yukon and adjacent Northwest Territories, 5. sahlbergi hybridizes with 5. albicincla and S. hudsonica.

N2  - H. mirabilis is in a taxonomically isolated position and the opinion is widely held that it is the oldest relic among living odonates. The species seems to have died out in the area of its original known haunts in Australia, due to farming, and it was probably last seen there in the late 1950ies. It is listed as endangered in the I.U.C.N. Invertebrate Red Data Book (1983). A strong colony has been found this year in S. Victoria. A brief history of the species is given and an opinion on its survival prospects.

N2  - The larva is described, figured and briefly compared with that of P. iridipennis (Burm.). The main differences lie in the shape and the length of the caudal gills. While, in the Makokou area, iridipennis lives in large rivers, P. camerunensis inhabits small forest streams. The density of this sp. is low. During the wet season (March-June, Sept.-Dee.) only 4 territorial males were observed within a day along a 1 km stretch, while a single individual occurs at the same during the dry season. Some observations on the reproductive behaviour are presented and compared with the features recorded in Sapho and Umma.

N2  - Dear Minter, There are small events in human life which appear entirely normal at the moment of their occurrence, but whose significance and far-reaching effects become apparent only with the lapse of time. December 23, 1971 is the day that marks one of the most important milestones in the history of our Society. It is the date you have signed your membership registration form, enclosed the 5.60 dollar draft for the 1971 membership fees, and mailed the lot to Utrecht. Simultaneously with your registration, several other registration forms were received by the Treasurer on December 28, and you have been assigned the membership number 71. As far as I could ascertain, out of almost 800 registration forms hitherto received, yours is the only one written on a typewriter with a red ribbon. And like a red ribbon, your activities and work are interwoven with the Society from the very first year of its existence The society became unseparable from you, and you are unseparable from the SIO, and much of what the Society has achieved in the first 15 years of its existence is due to your activities, suggestions and encouragement.

N2  - A brief biographic outline and appreciation of odonatological work of M.J. WESTFALL, Jr, Emeritus Professor of Zoology (University of Florida, Gainesville), Director of the SIO International Odonata Research Institute (Gainesville), Member of Honour and Past President of the International Odonatological Society, Chairman of the SIO National Office in the United States, Editior of Selysia, Associate Editor of Odonalologica, etc., are followed by an annotated checklist of new taxa he has introduced in Odonata, and by his bibliography (1936-1985). M ost of his odonatological work is devoted to the fauna of the New World, particularly in the areas of systematics and taxonomy, life-history studies, and larval morphology. During the past few decades, his work and his personality have significantly contributed to the popularisation of dragonflies and greatly influenced the development of odonatology in the United States. It may sound ironic, but work on Odonata taxonomy will be accelerated now that Professor Minter J. Westfall has retired. I say this because certain job responsibilities can hinder us from accomplishing as much as we desire in our chosen field. While Minter Westfall’s research at the University of Florida expressly involved Odonata, his teaching duties in biology and entomology limited the amount of time he could devote to dragonflies. The late-night phrase he used most during the years 1 worked with him was, ”If there were only more hours in a day!” More hours are now free for dragonfly study, as Minter officially retired from the teaching profession on April 30, 1985, culminating a 38-year career at the University of Florida.

N2  - Eggs of L. Julia were submitted to different constant-temperature regimes (10-35° C) under a constant photoperiod of 16 hr of light. The hatching threshold is 12.5°C, and the lower threshold of development according to R.T. TROTTIER’s formula (1971, Can. Em. 103: 1671-1683) is 11.76° C. Temperature range of development is between 20° and 30° C, with an optimum at 25° C (mean hatching time of 7.76 days). Different mathematical formulations of the velocity curve are compared. J. DAVIDSON’S sigmoid curve (1944, J. Anim. Ecol. 13; 26-38) corresponds closely with the observed development.

N2  - Individual male and female H. macropus moved only short distances from day to day along a stream near Cali, Colombia.The distributions of the two sexes along the stream were different and teneral males had a more nearly male than female distribution. Mature males tended to perch lower than either females or teneral males; and mature males which perched low were more active in presumably sex-related activities such as chasing and circle flights than those which perched relatively high. Both males and females, especially newly emerged individuals, spent time away from the immediate vicinity of the stream. There was a relatively high rate of individual turnover along the creek during the day even though total numbers remained relatively constant. Mating and oviposition behavior were somewhat variable, but conformed to the general pattern for the genus.

N2  - Data from 8 consecutive years of monthly sweep-net sampling in the littoral zone of Bays Mountain Lake are combined to show the life history of a "typical"generation of T. cynosura at this location (36° CN latitude, 550 m elevation). Population size peaks in mid-July, but declines by 60% before mid-August (mortality attributable to predation by both large dragonflies and sunfish). It then declines gradually through December, more steeply through the winter, and then gradually again until emergence in May. — Size-frequency distributions, and dry mass determinations for certain larvae, suggest that about 50% of the individuals in the penultimate instar in September are semivoltine; the others are fast-growing young-of-the-year entering the penultimate instar at a smaller size than members of the senior year-class. This size differential is maintained when larvae enter the final instar in October, and it appears that the smaller (junior year-class) individuals suffer more mortality during the winter, so that only about 25% of the emerging imagoes are univoltine.

N2  - Observations were carried out at a stream in the Western Transvaal, Republic of South Africa. 68 males were given unique colour combinations which enabled recognition without recapture. The positions of males were recorded at each visit. Some males occupied the same territory for up to 39 days. They occupied their territories throughout the day excluding conspecific males, but allowed oviposition within the territory by conspecific pairs in tandem. Non-territorial males attempted to displace territorial males. Detailed analyses of territoriality were carried out by noting the type, duration and temporal distribution of 285 flights by 5 adult males. Territorial males spent between 2.7% and 19.8% of their territorial occupation in flight (mean 5.5%). Flight activities consisted of patrolling (18.9% of all flights. 46.7% of total flight time and 4.0 flights/h), shifting flights (40%, 15.1% and 8.4 flights/h), investigatory flights towards movement (34.1%, 27.6% and 3.1 flights/h) and feeding flights (7.0%. 10.6% and 1.5 flights/h). The mean durations of patrolling, shifting, investigatory and feeding flights were 23.0, 3.5, 8.6 and 14.2 s respectively. The flight season was from mid-August 1984 to mid-May 1985.

(Corduliidae; Gomphomacromiinae), based on ca 300 specimens from Lower Cretaceous localities in West Mongolia, are described and illustrated. The material is deposited in the Institute of Palaeontology, USSR Academy of Sciences, Moscow. Sonidae fam. n. is classified as being closer to Gomphidae than to other Aeshnoidea; some specific features of sonid larvae are considered as adaptations to a nectonic mode of life. Some aspects of the new taxa, ecology, geological and palaeogeographical distribution are briefly discussed.

N2  - In 4 small peat bogs and 2 little lowland marshes of northeastern and central Switzerland the larval habitats of this stenotopic sp. were studied with reference to structural, physical and chemical parameters as well as the vegetation and the accompanying odon. fauna. The "classical" peat bog habitats (i.e. natural, shallow and partly overgrown basins or peat diggings) are characterized by acid water, free of carbonate and with low concentrations of electrolytes. The vegetation consists of Scheuchzerio-Caricetum limosae. The investigated larval habitats in lowland marshes are covered with Caricetum fuscae or C. diandrae. The water is slightly acid to neutral. It contains low carbonate concentrations, whereas the electrolytes values are rather high. Based on this evidence, an attempt is made towards the definition of ecological factors which determine the habitat selection. It is assumed that the habitat structural appearance plays the main role. Various other components are presumably but indirectly involved. Tentative conservation measures are suggested and the horizontal and vertical distribution of the sp. in Switzerland (57 known sites) is summarized and discussed with reference to the local temperature conditions.

Males were more prone to abandon a habitat if they did not obtain females during their first day’s visit to the site. The average time between marking and last recapture of recaptured males was 7.06 days. Young males mated with higher frequency than older males, but no individual male obtained more females than would be expected if matings were random.

N2  - The mark-and-recapture method was applied. Both males and females left the study area immediately after emergence. They stayed along the periphery of the forests in the hills until they attained the reproductive stages. When they became mature, they returned to the paddy fields. The mean longevity of males was considered to be at least 20 days. In the paddy fields, mature males showed territorial behaviour, whereas mature females remained in adjacent bushes. The extent of the territory was calculated as about 5 X 5 m by the estimated density. M ovements between hills and paddy fields were considered to be important for the life history in this species.

N2  - In an attempt to halt the effects of drainage in peripheral areas of a coastal raised mire peatland system in central Wales, ditches were blocked with transverse dams. Dams created long linear pools, flooding the areas of most serious water-table draw-down and peat slumping resulting from the past drainage activity. As a consequence, the wildlife interest of the ditches has been considerable enhanced. The existence of high and stabilised water-tables in areas surrounding the ditching has eliminated non-peatland plant species established since water-table decline. The establishment of the long linear pools has led to increases in the numbers of adults of at least 6 odon. spp. and of breeding teal; overall numbers of insects were 2-43 times greater over blocked ditches than over undammed ditches.

N2  - A series of museum specimens comprising 338 spp. in 118 genera and 16 families were photographed both with and without a Kodak 18-A ultraviolet (UV) filter. These photographs revealed that only Euphaea amphicyana reflected UV from its wings whereas all other spp. either did not absorb UV (e.g. 94.5% of the Coenagrionidae) or did so to varying degrees. In particular, spp. with flavescent. orange or brown wings (or wing patches) exhibited UV absorption for these same areas. However, other spp. with nearly transparent wings (especially certain Gomphidae) also had strong UV absorption. Pruinose body regions reflected UV but the standard acetone treatment for color preservation dissolves the wax particles of the pruinosity and destroys UV reflectivity. As is typical for arthropod cuticle, non-pruinose body regions absorbed UV and this obscured whatever color patterns might otherwise be visible without the camera’s UV filter. Frequently there is sexual dimorphism in UV patterns (wings and body) and these differences may play a role in various aspects of mating behavior.

N2  - A short biography is given of A.F. O’FARRELL (bom 9 Jan. 1917, Assam, India; inaugural Professor of Zoology at the University of New England, Australia), a student, and mentor of students, of Australian Odonata, with notes on his work and a list of his papers on dragonflies. ANTONY FREDERICK LOUIS O’FARRELL was born on 9 January, 1917, at Badlipar, Assam, India, of Irish parentage; his father spent most of his life in Assam, working for the Brahmaputra Steam Navigation Company. An only child. Tony accompanied his parents to England when his father retired in 1920-21. His father’s early death, and his own serious illness, dogged Tony’s childhood and delayed the start of his formal education until he was 12-13 years old. His informal education, however, started during his convalescence in a farmhouse surrounded by the largely unspoilt forests of the Weald, where his zeal for the study of insects was kindled. His entomological activities continued at Wimbledon College in London and, in due course. he graduated from the Royal College of Science in 1939, with First Class Honours and the Forbes Memorial Medal in Entomology. Plans for a Ph. D. were thwarted by, in Tony’s words, "one Adolf Hitler, who decided to turn on World War II in spite of my good intentions ’’. Declared unfit for flying duties, Tony became a part-time soldier in the Berkshire and East Sussex units of the Home Guard ("Dad's Army"!), while working, from 1940-42, on problems caused by elaterid beetle larvae (wireworms) to crops grown on old pastures ploughedfor conversion to arable land. By 1942, the emergency storage of wheat and other foodstuffs, often in unsuitable places, had produced major problems with insect pests, and Tony was posted to Belfast to work on them. There he met and. in 1944, married MARY ISABEL MILLEN.

N2  - Ceriagrion tenellum. Orthetrum coerulescens and Sympetrum danae have declined in eastern England during the present century and are now confined to a few localities in this region. The declines are due to the cessation of peat digging and to agricultural improvement. Measurements of habitat and counts of territorial males showed that the surviving isolated populations of these species are very small — total populations are probably of the order of hundreds or thousands only. To test the dispersal powers of acid water dragonflies acid water ponds were constructed at Wood Walton Fen, in a region which has lacked acid water for many decades. No acid water dragonflies have colonised these ponds during the last twelve years, although Aeshna juncea has visited them. Varying numbers of C. tenellum from Dorset were introduced to these ponds in 1974, 1975, 1979 and 1980. Only one of the introductions was successful, producing progeny which emerged two years later.. Its descendants did not survive. Some general conclusions about the conservation of dragonflies are drawn from this work.

N2  - The possibility that dragonflies with frequent, brief copulations differ from those with less frequent, longer copulations in the degree of sperm precedence by the last male to mate or in the mechanism by which sperm precedence is attained is examined.The reproductive behavior, sperm displacement ability and genitalic morphology of Celithemis elisa and Erythemis (Lepthemis) simplicicollis were studied, Celithemis have infrequent copulations of about 5 min in duration and oviposition is in tandem, while in Erythemis copulation durations last about 20 sec, males mate more frequently and mates are guarded for shorter periods of time. Both spp. are primarily sperm removers, despite their differences in copulation duration and penis morphology. In C. elisa about 68% of the sperm in a female’s bursa belongs to the last of 2 or more males to mate with her. For E. simplicicollis 54% of the sperm in the bursa belongs to the last male. Estimates of volume displacement for £ simplicicollis agree closely with data on sperm precedence for the same sp. (cf. M.E. McVEY & B.J. SMITTLE, 1984, J. Insect Physiol. 30: 619-628).

N2  - The new name is proposed for Archaeogomphus Q.-b. LIN (1976, Acta palaeontol. sin. 15: 99-100, 116, textfig. I, pi. 2, figs 5-6; — type sp.: A. labius), which is preoccupied by the extant gomphid genus Archaeogomphus E.B. WILLIAMSON (1919, Occ. Pap. Mus. Zool. Univ. Mich. 63: 1-6). In 1976, the author described a new genus and species of fossil Odonata from the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous deposits of western Liaoning Province, China under the name Archaeogomphus labius. The dragonfly, of which only the larval stage is known, is utterly distinct from all the known gomphid larvae, therefore a new genus was erected for its reception.

N2  - The operation of the larval labium in dragonflies is reviewed and compared with other fast actions in other arthropods. The dragonfly labium is similar to most of these in that a locking mechanism allows energy storage prior to the action, but differs in that its successful operation requires coordinated and rapid operation of two joints, not just one. The locking mechanism resides in the primary flexor muscle of the labium, which alone appears to allow energy for the operation of both joints to be stored and prevents the labium from being protracted during jet propulsion.

N2  - The territorial, copulatory and post-copulatory behaviour at 2 artificial pools in Trinidad are described. Each pool held one territorial resident; when more than one male was present a fight ensued. Territorial disputes can be divided into two types: short (mean duration 16.9 s) or long (mean duration 5.3 min). Diel patterns of female arrival and territorial disputes were similar. Residents always won short disputes; intruders won 41% of long disputes. Non-territorial males were often observed. The temporal pattern of female arrival at the pool was clumped. Thirty-five matings near water were obtained by territorial residents, 7 by non-territorial males and 11 by males of unknown status. Copulation was brief: the mean duration of the wheel position, which occurred in flight, was 11.7 s. Males non-contact guard females during egglaying. Instances of males copulating with a second female while guarding, and of females being mated by a second male while being guarded are described.

N2  - In 1955, W.H. CROSS (7. Elisha Mitchell scient. Soc. 71: 9-17) surveyed the Anisoptera of a 778 km2 site (Savannah River Plant, SRP) on the upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina, U.S.A. However, since his study, the streams and swamps of the SRP have undergone dramatic changes associated directly with the discharge of thermal effluent into three of the stream systems and construction of a 1206 ha reservoir system on another. — The anisopteran spp. composition is discussed in terms of habitats sampled: (1) unimpacted blackwater streams, (2) post-thermal streams, (3) thermal streams, (4) thermally-altered delta-swamp, (5) post-thermal delta-swamp, (6) ponds and Carolina Bays, (7) Par Pond Reservoir system, and (8) the Savannah River. — Overall, there was no significant difference between the total number of anisopteran spp. collected by Cross (58) and during this study (63), despite the dramatic changes of aquatic habitats of the SRP. This was not surprising when considering the following: (1) the majority (75%) of the spp, collected during both studies were common ubiquitous limnophilic forms; (2) many of these were adapted for the fluctuating and unpredictable temperature and water levels occurring in the lentic habitats of the SRP; and (3) the colonization of newly-created habitats was enhanced by the long flight periods of many spp., and by the asynchronous multivoltinism of some. However, we could not find 6 spp. reported by Cross, but did collect 11 spp. not reported by him.

N2  - The postembryonic development of the visual apparatus was traced from early larval instars to the adult stage. During the larval life, the optic lobe shows minor changes in its structure. It consists of 3 neuropiles interconnected through 2 chiasmata. The development of the optic lobe is the result of the mitotic activity of the outer and inner optic anlages. This activity decreases during the last instar larva and eventually stops. The anlages have completely disappeared in the adult stage.

N2  - Copulatory activity of I. elegans is described in a high-density population in the south of France, Copulations lasted for 324 ± 90 min (s.d.) with stage I occupying 239 ±112 min, and stage II, 85 ± 48 min. The characteristic movements of stages I and II are described. They differ from those in other zygopterans by being frequently interrupted by extended inactive pauses which account for the long duration of copulation. Long copulation may allow males to guard females until they are prepared to oviposit after 16:00 h. Close-up observations of copulations were made possible by crushing the heads of captured pairs: This allowed females to be dissected without interrupting copulation, and video films of the penis movements within the transparent genital tract of the female were made. Sperm removal from the bursa and the subsequent transfer of sperm from the male were witnessed. Movements of the penis were correlated with those of the second and third abdominal segments of the male. Ablation experiments showed that continuation of copulation depended only on the maintenance of contact between the ovipositor blades and recesses in the male, probably containing sensory bristles. Reflex responses of vaginal and spermathecal muscles were brought about by stimulation of vaginal campaniform sensilla by the penis. Pairs with crushed heads performed copulations without pauses and lasting about I h, as did tethered intact pairs. Similar short copulations also sometimes occur in the wild.

The Tyndall-blue of the abdominal spots and eyes changes to greyish purple with decreasing temperature (< 16° C), the reverse colour change occurs with increasing temperature (> 10° C), The colour change is possibly controlled by the same mechanisms as recorded in Austrolestes annulosus and Diphlebia nymphoides, although in A. caerulea it seems to be more rapid. Colour change and the special perching behaviour, as temperature-regulating mechanisms in A. caerulea males, and their adaptive value, are discussed.

N2  - In order to determine the fecundity and the number of eggs deposited, females were captured in field, dissected and classified into 7 age classes. The period of maiden flight (4 age classes) was estimated in a laboratory-reared population as 19 days. Change in the bursa copulatrix volume of mature females suggests sperm displacement. The mature egg size decreases with female age. Egg maturation appears to occur mainly in the pre-mature period. Not counting the immature eggs, the numbers of mature and submature eggs (fecundity) were estimated to be 300 and 150, resp. However, the difference in the mature egg number between females at the beginning and at the end of the mature period was about 250, which may be the actual life span reproductive performance. This is about half the estimate obtained by dissection.

N2  - Eugregarines inhabiting the midgut of zygopteran imagines usually appear as sublethal parasites; when present in large numbers, they enfeeble the host by damaging its gut wall. After the dragonfly adult season the gregarines survive in the habitat as extrahost oocysts. To become infective, they presumably have to pass the winter in the habitat; the infection occurs through ingestion. — In western Norway, Pyrrhosoma nymphula and Enallagma cyathigerum appear either in large, compact colonies. based on small, solitary tarns or ponds, or as marginal populations of low density, associated with streams and lakes. The intermingling of imagines from neighbouring breeding sites is insignificant. The dense colonies of small waters appear most prone to overinfection; the marginal populations harbour low numbers of gregarines and many are gregarine-free. — There is a gregarine-induced susceptibility to predation. The dense dragonfly colonies accumulate infective gregarine germs, maintaining a high infection potential for successive generations. In such populations the gregarine infection is endemic, and represents one of the selection agents.

N2  - In contrast to most odon. females which mate repeatedly, females of I. verticalis were found to be effectively monogamous, remating only if sperm loads were low enough to cause substantial sterility of egg clutches. A female’s colour phase corresponded to her sexual maturation. Virgin and non-virgin females were non-randomly distributed in the field and responded differently to male approaches. Both the penis structure and the behaviour of males during copula suggested that males could displace sperm if given the chance to do so. However, evidence of sperm removal using the volume of sperm storage organs of females interrupted in copula was equivocal. I. verlicalis females are apparently monogamous because they do not benefit by mating repeatedly and cannot be forced to mate. As predicted for a monoandrous mating system where the potential opportunity for sexual selection on males is relatively low, males showed no overt forms of male-male competition, and were repelled by females giving a wing-flutter display.

Larvae of L. siqueirai occurred in 35,3% of A. aquilega which has a small central tank and many axils but in only 11.0% of A. nudicaulis which possesses a larger central tank but fewer axils. The incidence of larvae was significantly higher in the dry (29.4%) than in the wet (16.6%) season. Up to 7 L. siqueirai larvae were recorded from individual A. aquilega, and the frequency distribution of larvae in this bromeliad sp. fits a negative binomial. The most abundant invertebrates in Aechmea were Diptera (Culicidae, Thaumaleidae, Chironomidae, Ceratopogonidae, Psychodidae, Tipulidae), Coleoptera (Helodidae), and oligochaete worms. Reductions in abundance among any of these taxa due to predation by L siqueirai could not be demonstrated. However, the predaceous mosquito Toxorhynchiles haemurrhoidalis was negatively associated with and suffered reduced survivorship in the presence of L. siqueirai, probably due to predation by the latter.

N2  - The capture, preservation and subsequent examination at known times during copulation has shown that most mature females copulate more than once. By marking copulating pairs it was found that some females accepted second males on the same day. Copulations of decapitated males with intact females were relatively short-lasting as also was the case when both sexes had been decapitated. However, copulations of intact males with decapitated females were long-lasting and resembled those of undisturbed pairs. Males therefore apparently control the duration of copulation. Measurements of sperm volumes in copulating females support the hypothesis that copulating males remove all the sperm of rivals from the bursa, but none from the spermatheca. Sperm vesicles of males contain a mean of 0.011 ± 0.0019 mm3( n=14) during stage 1 of copulation. Spermathecae of females after sperm transfer contain a mean of 0.0064 ± 0.0023 mm3 (n=I I), whereas bursae contain a mean of 0.0023 ± 0.0009 mm3 (n=14). During stage II of copulation, males transfer the whole vesicle contents, which is about 5 times the volume that can be accommodated in the bursa. This apparent anomaly is discussed.

N2  - The range of C. s. watersoni is defined. It is bounded to the west by C. s. amasina, with which it hybridizes in a river valley at Gdrele. The wide variability of the hybrids indicates that they themselves are fertile, and therefore establishes the subspecific level of both taxa. It is suggested that the eastern boundary of ssp. waterstoni is defined by hybrid population(s) (C. s. waterstoni x C. s. mingrelica) north of Batum, originally identified as C. s. tschaldirica by Bartenef. The south-western range boundary of the latter taxon, which is shown to be valid, is also redefined. It is confined to some high plateaus of Eastern Anatolia and the S.S.R. Armenia, is broadly separated from C. s. walersloni by the valley of the middle and lower (Joruh River in the west, and hybridizes with C. s. amasina in the South along a fairly wide area of intergradation. — The present study bears heavily on the general taxonomic situation within C. splendens. In redefining the components of this complex, as much weight should be given to range boundaries as to morphology.

N2  - Breeding site fidelity of adult P. lydia was studied at a small pond in central coastal California. Both males and females returned in equal proportions following marking. No morphological or behavioural differences were detected between males that dispersed and those not observed to disperse. Male dispersal occurred primarily soon after capture and among relatively old males that were at or near the end of their reproductive lifespan. These latter individuals often wandered widely, but only rarely obtained matings. Transplanted males disappeared more frequently after marking than individuals not transplanted; however, those observed again were as likely to remain at the pond to which they were transplanted as were marked, untransplanted residents. The results indicate that adult dispersal in this species during the reproductive period is small.

N2  - The life history was studied during 1981-1985, using natural populations and reared specimens. The flying season lasts from late May to mid Sept., reproductive behavior was observed between mid-June and mid-Sept, The average egg stage duration was 10 days (at 21-33° C), or 20 days (at 11-32° C, in the laboratory). Two modes of larval development were discerned. U nivoltine larvae developed slowly and hibernated usually between the F-3 and F-l instars; the ultimate (i.e. the 10th, prolarva excl.) instar appeared in the next spring and the adults emerged between late May and mid July. Bivoltine larvae hatched about June 24, reached the final (9th) instar between late July and early Aug., and the adults emerged during Aug. and early Sept. The latter were smaller than those from the univoltine larvae. The antennal development is of the BBBA type of K. MIYAKAWA (Odonatologica 6 [1977J 173-180).

N2  - Diurnal change in territorial behaviour at a sunlit point in a stand (sunfleck) was studied by observation in climax forests of Urabandai, Fukushima Pref., Japan. The number of patrolling flights of a male occupying a sunfleck increased towards noon and decreased afterwards. The flight height above the perching site was around 50 cm, including a round-trip flight along the periphery of the sunfleck. Hovering above the perching point was also observed. During a patrolling flight males did not encounter conspecific males, females or other insects, so that such a flight may be understood as a display of the occupation of the sunfleck. Encounters with conspecific males mainly occurred when the male was perched at the sunfleck. The number of fight encounters was high until noon, while non-aggressive encounters increased in the evening. High success rate in capturing prey occurred in the evening. Males moved out from among sunflecks in the morning, but stayed at one sunfleck in the evening. The habitat of P. echigoana in relation to its territorial behaviour is also discussed.

N2  - A method is described for inducing the tandem position by hand-pairing in Calopteryx species. In C. maculata, hand-pairing resulted in tandem formation and normal copulation in 81 out of 91 pairs. Thus the elaborate pair formation and courtship normally seen in this species are not required for copulation to occur. Conspecific pairs were also obtained for C. aequabilis, C. splendens, and C. virgo, but not for several other species of Zygoptera. 30 of 36 heterospecific pairs between C. maculata and C. dimidiata resulted in tandem formation and 17 of these ended in copulation, despite a size difference between the two species. This result suggests a lack of mechanical isolation or species discrimination at the tandem and copulation steps.

N2  - Observations were carried out at an artifical pond, where the larvae cannot survive but imagines exhibit reproductive behaviour (inch oviposition). The males attempt to perch at the pond, but only the "pond owner” does so, excluding the others which perch around the pond according to a hierarchy; those most successful in contest remaining closer to the water. Receptive females are usually present only above water. For this reason the pond owner has the greatest probability of finding a mate. After copulation he remains in tandem during oviposition. Meanwhile the second most aggressively successful male takes his place, and after oviposition the dominant male is usually excluded by the former, which becomes the new owner. Copulatory behaviour is described, and the factors inducing and limiting oviposition are discussed.

Assoc. 42: 73-76. — (Contra Costa Mosquito Abatement Distr., 1330 Concord Ave., Concord, CA 94520, USA). Simulated-field predation tests with A. junius were conducted in enclosed-unit fiberglass tubs, with both single and alternative prey available (Culex peus: C. peus and Chironomus species 51 respectively). C. peus egg rafts and C. sp. 51 egg masses were periodically introduced to sustain prey population and daily prey emergence was recorded. Predators were initially introduced at 3 densities and monitored at 2-week intervals for growth and population size. Results showed that dragonfly larvae controlled mosquito populations at all 3 densities in the single, and the 2 higher densities in the alternative prey tests. In both tests, the higher predator densities were seen to reduce prey populations in a shorter period of time. However, with subsequent mosquito reduction predator populations also declined to a few remaining large larvae. These reduced larval populations continued to maintain control of the mosquitos. With the presence of an alternative prey, predator populations still declined after mosquito reduction, but remained significantly higher than in the single-prey tests. Larvae exercised no significant control over the midge populations.

N2  - The eggshell of Brachythemis lacustris contains a trabeculate endochorion and an exochorion perforated by aeropyles; that of Tholymis tillarga is similar but it has a much higher density of aeropyles. In both spp. wetting the exochorion at oviposition causes it to become sticky and to attach firmly to the substrate. Later it hardens to form a more or less continuous, perforated covering over the eggs: no evidence for the addition of a spumaline in the vagina was obtained. It is suggested that the shells in these species act as plastrons with properties adjusted to the differing epiphytic modes of each. — The eggshells of Orthetrum coerulescens and Sympetrum danae are not trabeculate. On being wetted they produce, after a variable latency, a thick, sticky coat of jelly probably derived from material in the exochorion. It surrounds each egg, separating the eggs within a cluster, and it remains deformable throughout development.

N2  - A common North American pond dragonfly was studied in order to quantify the behavior of territorial individuals. This sp. has 5 distinct territorial behaviors: perching, patrolling, interspecific chasing, chasing adjacent territorial conspecifics, and chasing nonterritorial conspecifics. Associations between different territorial behaviors were established using sequential analysis of two-act sequences. After leaving a perch, males showed no significant tendency to engage preferentially in any of the other behaviors. However, after chasing other individuals, males preferentially patrolled; after patrolling, males typically perched. These results are interpreted in light of the proposed functions for territorial behaviors in L. luctuosa.

N2  - A young (F-2) female cordulegastrid larva from the northern slope of the Pontic Alps (NE Turkey) is described and illustrated. It obviously pertains to C. mzymtae, the only Cordulegaster from the mountain forests along the eastern Black Sea coast of which the larva was still undescribed. The taxonomic position of the species within the genus is discussed, on the basis of a morphological comparison with larvae of C. boltoni, C. insignis and C. bidentatus. Its closest relative is found to be C. bidematus. Notes on the larval habitat are provided, and its significance for the distribution of C. mzymtae is stressed.

N2  - Males of the common Australian libellulid O. caledonicum defended small territories at a pond in areas where there was open water at the shoreline. The density of males at the pond edge and the proportion of time spent in flight was greatest at midday. Females visited open shoreline to oviposit in shallow water for a period of about one minute. Males captured incoming females and copulated for periods ranging from 6 s to about 20 min. Unlike some other spp. of Orthetrum, prolonged copulation was apparently not practised exclusively by subordinate males unable to secure a territory. Alternative hypotheses on the variation in copulation duration are presented.

N2  - Males of the Neotropical genus Philogenia, occurring from Costa Rica to Bolivia, were studied. To the 22 known valid spp. are added descriptions and figs of 5 previously undescribed ones. Type localities and deposition of holotypes of these are: boliviana sp. n. (Bolivia: La Paz Dep., Yungas de la Paz; no date; Foerster Coll., UMAA), buenavista sp. n. (Bolivia: Santa Cruz Dep., Buena Vista; no date; FSCA), mangosisa sp. n. (Ecuador: Morona-Santiago Prov., Mangosisa; 30-XI-I945; UMAA), peruviana sp. n. (Peru: San Martin Dep., Tarapoto; 16-111-1947; UMAA), and tinalandia sp. n. (Ecuador: Pichincha Prov., Tinalandia; I3-V-I985; FSCA). Each of these 27 spp. was assigned to 1 of 6 species-groups, based primarily on the superior abdominal appendages. The groups are characterized, a key to all known males is presented, and a diagram is given to show assignment of spp. to groups and to postulate relationships. The occurrence of spp. per country is tabulated; most occur in but one, cassandra Hag. being exceptional.

N2  - Zygopteran wing display is reviewed, and a distinction is made between threat display of the male and refusal display of the female. The former is suggested to have originated from preliminary movements of attack flight, while the latter from preliminary movements of escape flight. The resemblance of the displays in the 2 sexes is discussed in terms of imitation of the male by the female, through advergent evolution, according to a mimicry system in which the male acts as the model, the female as the mimic, and the approaching male as the signal receiver, which responds the same way to both model and mimic signals.

N2  - The genera Tholymis Hagen and Parazyxomma Pinhey have been classified in the Trameinae (or Zyxommatinae), whereas Brachythemis Brauer is included in the Sympetrinae. In spite of this, however, the male secondary genitalia and the arrangement of the female’s sperm storage organs in T. tillarga, P. flavicans, B. lacustris and B. leucosticta resemble each other much more closely than they do those of any other sp. so far examined in either subfamily. Moreover these spp. show several other structural similarities as well as having comparable reproductive behaviour. The structural and behavioural similarities are unlikely to be the result of evolutionary convergence and probably result from a recent common ancestor. It may, therefore, be appropriate to include them within one subfamily.

N2  - The influence of 4 different factors on spatial distribution was tested experimentally: developmental stage, predator density, duration of site occupation and presence or absence of larvae of different developmental stages. Six parameters were used to characterize spatial distribution. — Three of the factors tested influenced spatial occupation in A. imperator: the size of home ranges increased with larval development, the coexistence of larvae of two different larval instars induced an increase of the volume occupied by medium-sized larvae and an instability of the home ranges of final-instar larvae, and the frequency of agonistic interactions increased with larval density. Analysis of the spatial distribution of aquatic insects is required to understand the dynamics of insects in aquatic environments (HILDREW et al., 1980; JOHNSON & CROWLEY, 1980; SPENCE & SCUDDER, 1980; ALLAN, 1982; HUGGINS & DUBOIS, 1982; MARTIN, 1985). Recent reports have stressed the value of an ethological approach towards interactions (between insects) for understanding modalities of spatial occupation (SIH, 1982; PECKARSKY & PENTON, 1985; SJOSTROM, 1985).

N2  - Mark-release-recapture data of 3 single-pond populations of L. barbarus and I of L. virens were worked out to estimate: consistence of populations at emergence and at the egg stage, sex ratios at emergence and in the reproductive period, pre-reproduction period duration, survival in the field and dispersal of females in respect to males. On the basis of critical considerations, sex ratio at emergence is suggested to be 1:1. while in the reproductive period it is male-biased. The length of the pre-reproductive period is widely variable in L. harharus. while in L. virens it falls within the range of the former. By comparing the length of the pre-reproductivc period of L. virens populations from central Europe with that of those in central Italy, it is suggested that there is a correlation between latitude and pre-reproductive period length in this sp. as is also known in other lestids. Survival rate in the field was lower in the reproductive than in the pre-reproductive period, probably due to heavier predation in the former. Females dispersed more than males, dispersal rates being w idely variable in different samples and years. Evidence of dispersal in leneral rather than in mature damsclflies suggests that colonization of new ponds may occur as a consequence of earlier acquaintance with flooded ponds, w hich can induce the damselflies to home to the new pond after maturation.

N2  - At Halcyon Hotsprings in British Columbia, Canada, male A. vivida wait for females in the morning at sunlit basking sites on the forest floor, 10-15 m from water. Copulations last for an average of about 40 min, after which the pair remains in tandem for 2-3 hr before arriving at the oviposition site. This long copulation plus the latent period constitute "pre-oviposition guarding", a tactic that serves to keep females from other males until conditions at the water are suitable for oviposition. Males that are unable to capture mates in this way, arrive at the water at about the same time as the tandem pairs. They may then be able to copulate with a female who has escaped or is released from tandem. These afternoon copulations last for about 10 minutes and oviposition starts almost immediately afterwards. — Male A. vivida cannot control females’ access to oviposition sites by controlling the sites themselves, because oviposition sites are too numerous and too widely dispersed, and males are not able to fly well enough to control them. Instead of resource-control, male A. vivida practice female-control, especially away from the water in the morning when the majority of matings occur. While this is the first study to view zygopteran mating behavior in this way, the strategy is probably widespread among zygopterans.

N2  - P. iridipennis was observed to oviposit into the stems of Cyperus involucratus by making long slits through which up to 90 eggs were packed in a single row, 0.5 mm below the surface and at 60° to the long axis of the stem. In contrast, when ovipositing into the leaflike bracts of the same plant, females inserted each egg through a separate slit in a manner resembling that used by other calopterygids. Females more commonly oviposited into bracts than into stems, and bracts were found to contain up to 9 times more eggs mm"3 than stems. When offered the subcrescentic leaves of Typha domingensis as abnormal oviposition sites, eggs were laid using either of the two modes, and it is suggested that stems and bracts of i C. involucratus are normally distinguished by tactile receptors on the legs. The stems of Cyperus contain many more sclerenchyma strands than the bracts, and the force required to drive in a pin by a set amount was 2.38 times greater than that needed for bracts. The unusual mode of oviposition used by P. iridipennis when ovipositing into stems may therefore be an adaptation for penetrating tough plant tissues.

N2  - Marking experiments showed that under high male density conditions the behaviour of A. cyanea males is strongly territorial; when male density is low, long-range patrol flights without territorial attachment are observed. It is suggested that this variable behaviour is an adaptation to fluctuations in male density which maximizes mating chance.

N2  - The influence of interspecific interactions between adults of sympatric S. sanguineum and S. flaveolum on the perching and flight behaviour of the males and the reproductive behaviour was studied at waters near Brunswick (FR Germany). Grid mappings show a horizontal habitat selection. S. flaveolum preferred perch and oviposition sites at earlier successional stages with lower height of the emergent vegetation. The overlapping indices and cumulations of the males’ perches were density-related. In areas with common oviposition sites there was a vertical separation of both species. The perches of the males of 5. sanguineum were higher vertical stalks whereas 5 flaveolum males remained perched lower on broad sloping stalks. The height of the perch site was influenced by the presence of heterospecific males. — Site-tenacious 5. flax’eolum males showed a longer total time of flight and more flights over longer distances. They were involved in interactions with males of the other species more frequently than 5. sanguineum was with conspecific males. Males with neighbouring heterospecifics were more site-fixed and their flight activity decreased. In 5. sanguineum 48% (versus 40% in S. flaveolum) of the ovipositing tandems were interfered with by heterospecific males mostly when changing the oviposition site. Possible ultimate factors selecting for the spacing out of the species (different horizontal habitat selection and interspecific interactions) are discussed.

N2  - Mycobacterium chelonei, M. flavescens, M. fortuitum and M. sphagni were recorded in Sphagnum bogs, inhabited by L. rubicunda. Experiments with tritium labeled mycobacteria indicate that these are accumulated by the cladocerans. The L. ruhicunda larvae acquire the mycobacterian flora through ingestion of Cladocera. It is shown that a direct correlation exists between the mycobacteria concentration in the bog water and the larval growth of L ruhicunda.

N2  - Histological and histochemical studies on the cuticle of A. immaculifrons from the third larval instar to the imago revealed 3 types of cuticular organisation. The first type was present in larval instar 3 to 9; instars 10 to 13 had type-II, while the imago had type-HI. The type-I cuticle had 3 layers, i.e. epi-, exo- and endocuticle. The protein of the epicuticle as well as that of the exocuticle is stabilized by disulphide linkages. The type-II epicuticle resembled its counterpart in type-1 in the mode of hardening but the exocuticle had undergone hardening involving both aromatic substances and organic sulphur (R-S-R). Lying between the exocuticle and the endocuticle was a new layer, the mesocuticle. This new layer had undergone primary tanning. The type-111 cuticle differed from the first two, both in its histology and histochemistry. The epicuticle was bilaminar, having an outer lipid layer and an inner lipoprotein lamina. The inner epicuticle as well as exocuticle had undergone hardening by aromatic tanning. However, the mesocuticle resembled its homologue in the preceding stage in chemical composition. The protein from the 3 types of cuticle was extracted and analysed by electrophoretic and chromatographic methods. These results substantiated those obtained by histochemical procedures. Changes in the proportion of the exoskeleton to body weight in larvae and adults were also recorded. The results are discussed in relation to the evolution of aerial life.

N2  - The mark-recapture method was used for 9 coexisting spp. in Kanagawa (Oct., 1981-1984). In the 4 paddy fields studied. S. parvulum, S. eroticum and S. darwinianum (in 2 fields) were dominant resp. in downstream direction. Mating occurred mainly in the morning, and the flying activities decreased during the afternoon. 5. parvulum and S. eroticum covered short distances during a day, while S. darwinianum. S. frequens and S. baccha had low recapture rates, suggesting larger flight distances. In the hills, the community structure was more complex than in the paddy fields, though the population density was lower, and no mating behaviour occurred there. Consequently, the hills are considered to represent the Sympetrum roosting area. The paddy fields community structure in Oct. depended on the extent of the available habitats.

N2  - The female of D. fujiama Fraser has a 2n = 24 karyotype, including a pair of X chromosomes which are similar in size and the largest elements in the complement. The males of both D. fujiama and D. m. moiwanus (Okumura) have the same number of chromosomes, 2n = 23 and n = 12; in each sp. a single X chromosome, which is the largest element, is always observed in the spermatogonial karyotype. At diakinesis and early Ml, the X chromosome consisting of a pair of chromatids is easily distinguished from the autosomal bivalents on account of their different morphology. Preliminary examination of C-banded spermatogonial metaphases and spermatocyte complements at diakinesis in D. fujiama indicates that discrimination between the X chromosome and the autosomes is easy because of a peculiar distribution pattern of constitutive heterochromatin of the X chromosome. Such chromosomal evidence reveals that D. fujiama is characterized by a male heterogametic sex chromosome system of the XO/XX-type. No m-chromosome could be encountered in either sp.

A certain number of variations are constantly associated with the nodal and cubito-anal spaces of the wings, while size appears to be partially related to the surface area, wing chord and aspect ratio.

N2  - The eleclroretinogram resulting from the stimulation of the eye of larva and adult Enallagma is a slow potential characterised by a negative, monophasic wave form (peak followed by a plateau). The peak represents photoreceptor response while the plateau reflects the optic lobe responses. Recordings during the life-cycle of Enallagma demonstrate a progressive development from the optic lobe to the ommatidia. Intensity-response functions of the larva and the adult reflect their mode of life and represent physical modifications of the rhabdom during the life-cycle. About the time of emergence the intensity-response function of the dorsal and ventral regions of the eye shows desynchronisation. The ventral has characteristics of the adult while the dorsal has characteristics found at a specific maturation period. Sensitivity curves of the larva and the adult are clearly distinguishable. In the former, the principal peak is around 525-540 nm while in the latter it is around 366 nm. In addition, the adult possesses a second minor peak around 466-490 nm or 490-540 nm, depending on the species. Light and dark adaptations of larvae and adults are similar i.e. they are intensity dependent. Complete adaptation is achieved within 40 seconds; however, while the larva shows a gain of 1.0-1.5 log units, the adult shows only a gain of 0,1 log unit. Nevertheless, adults show an ’’off’response when the light stimulus is terminated. This response, which probably is neural in origin, maintains a constant level of sensitivity. — This study shows .that organisation of the compound eye in odonates is based on a "primitive” model as opposed to the "evolved" system found in Corduliidae. There are also other physiological differences. The primary role of vision, which in these insects is the capture of prey, necessitates a system well adapted for survival in water and air. Enallagma not only has a specialised compound eye but also one whose full potential can be realised rapidily.

N2  - The individual distribution is less aggregated in C. melanurum; the mate locating tactics of the male are of the "searching” type, while in C. nipponicum the tactics are of the ”sit-and-wait” type, and the individual distribution is more aggregated. In C. nipponicum, the male groups hold their position near the waterside and the female groups gather outside the male groups, thus increasing the probability for the two sexes to encounter each other. C. melanurum travels further in its day-to-day movements, but there is a strong tendency for both species to stay at or return to their original sites.

N2  - The reproductive behavior of C. dimidiata is described for populations at the northern edge of its range where it is sympatric with C. maculata. Like other Calopteryx spp. C. dimidiata males are territorial, give a pair-forming and postcopulatory display (= cross display) to females at an oviposition site in their territory, and give courtship displays to perched females. Males and females copulate frequently and for short times relative to other damselflies, and sperm removal occurs during the early stages of copulation. Females oviposit into aquatic vegetation, usually in a male’s territory. The primary behavioral differences between C. maculala and C. dimidiala are that in C. dimidiala: (I) the cross display is performed while the male floats on the water surface rather than while perched on an oviposition site, (2) females oviposit while totally submerged rather than at the water surface, and (3) there is no clear daily peak in copulation or oviposition frequency. The reproductive behavior of C. dimidiala is also compared with published results for other North American, European and Japanese Calopteryx spp.

N2  - Evidence from free-flight cinematography, dissection and manipulation suggests that the fulcroalar muscle in Odonata facilitates wing profile change between Cu and R+M at the start of, and sometimes during, the downstroke by providing some of the power needed to deform the axillary complex. The flexion is completed primarily by the first basalar and second subalar depressors. The fulcroalar muscle may also influence wing deformation at the start of the upstroke. Sectioning shows that it is a single muscle, not two as has been suggested.

N2  - When offered prey of 2 sizes, larvae of E. cyathigerum exhibited typical Type-11 functional-response curves. When offered equal proportions of the two prey types, larvae preferred the larger type, regardless of hunger level. When offered different relative proportions of the two prey types, larvae markedly preferred the large type, except when the latter were least numerous. We interpret our findings in the light of classical optimal diet theory.

N2  - The female genitalia are characterized by a spherical bursa copulatrix and 2 separate, narrow spermathecae. The fourth segment of the penis is characterized by 2 long cornua, 2 inflatable inner lobes, 2 flap-like lateral lobes and a tube-like apical lobe. Sperm remains were found on most parts of the penis of individuals from interrupted copulas, especially on the apical and inner lobes. — Observations of copulatory movement, supplemented by a reconstruction of the coitus, suggest that sperm may be removed and ejaculated during a single type of movement, throughout the major part of copulation.

N2  - Mated female Orthetrum spp. carry very small volumes of stored sperm compared to many other libellulids. In several Orthelrum spp. and in a few other species, most copulations are followed by periods of "rest" (PCRs) lasting from one to several minutes during which the male and female perch close together before the start of oviposition. During PCRs males sometimes show "aggressive” behaviour towards their mates, apparently attempting to induce them to oviposit. Experimental and natural disturbances of female O. coerulescens during PCRs were found to excite at least brief oviposition bouts in 10 out of 48 cases. Females captured during or after copulation could be induced to oviposit large egg clutches. Several possible explanations for PCRs are considered: they may allow females to assess predator pressure at the oviposition site, to judge a male’s guarding capacity, or to "handle” sperm either mobilising it for fertilisation or selecting it according to the quality of their mates. PCRs do not seem to be needed for egg preparation.

N2  - Male size decreased through the breeding season. Several phenotypic characters of paired, unpaired but patrolling, and feeding males were measured and compared. There was no significant difference in mean wing loading between paired and patrolling individuals, but paired males had a lower wing loading than feeding males. No blue colour differences could be detected between paired and unpaired males. There were no differences in the mean amount of black markings between paired and unpaired males though there was significantly less variation in the index of blackness among paired than among patrolling individuals. Also there was no difference in size of the ”U-shaped" mark on the second abdominal segment between paired and unpaired males. The difficulties in quantifying the proportion of non-random variation in mating success are discussed.

N2  - Due to a reproductive diapause, L. sponsa has a postponed prereproductive period in the southern half of Japan. In 1987, in Kanazawa City, the prereproductive period lasted 70-90 days: emergence commenced from late May, but reproductive behaviour did not begin until late August. During the summer the oocyte development was suppressed and ripe ova did not appear until mid-August. The colour maturation of the female body, however, proceeded without delay, independently of sexual maturation. The colour maturation and spermatogenesis in males also proceeded without delay and almost all males were fully mature in both features by early July, Body weight, exclusive of lipids, also rapidly more than doubled during the colour maturation period in both sexes. Thus, freshly emerged individuals required a post-teneral development not only of the gonads, but also of such basic body structures as e.g. the muscles, the cuticle, etc.

N2  - Males of L. saturata either patrol long stretches of stream in search of mates, or perch near stagnant pools used as oviposition sites. Perched males respond to patrolling males by flying with them in ascending flights along the stream. Only one male eventually returns to the perch site. Perching males rarely defend the same location from day to day. Ovipositing females are often receptive, and after a brief aerial mating, males employ non-contact guarding. Females, however, apparently eventually lose their guarding partners, because they are rarely seen ovipositing with a male in attendance except briefly, shortly after copulation.

N2  - Larval development in a northern population of the Western Palaearctic P. nymphula has been studied in the field and laboratory to identify responses to physical factors that regulate the time of its annual emergence. In the field, as in more southerly British populations, development is normally semivoltine. Typically, larvae overwinter first in a range of early instars and enter the penultimate (F-l) instar in their second summer, remaining in that instar until late August, after which they enter the final (F-0) instar rapidly during the next month and overwinter in that instar. Arrest of the senior age-cohort in F-l during summer and then in F-0 during the winter reduces temporal variation among larvae and contributes greatly to synchronisation of metamorphosis and then emergence in early summer (May to early July). A variable, usually small, proportion of the senior cohort spends the second winter in F-1. In spring such larvae enter F-0 rapidly in May and proceed directly to metamorphosis and emergence. Such individuals are smaller, as F-0 and as adults, than those that overwintered as F-0 and they constitute a second, later component of the emerging population.

N2  - The spines on the convex and concave wing nervures in Anisozygoplera and Anisoptera differ morphologically and, according to their location, also in distribution and size. The latter is correlated to the surface and wing chords. The relative numbers of spines on the fore and hind wings and on both surfaces of the same wing are constant in the two suborders. Comparing these results with those on Zygoptera (M. D’ANDREA & S. CARFl, 1988, Odonatologica 17; 313-335) reveals a substantial uniformity of this trait in the entire order of Odonata.

N2  - Communal roosting is described at 9 sites all close to a temporary pond on the campus of Madurai Kamaraj University, south India, observed between November. 1987, and the end of January, 1988. Up to 100 males and females, all sexually inactive, were found at one roosting site whereas others normally contained smaller numbers. Some sites were in regular use for at least 70 days. Communally roosting females had immature ovaries whereas males contained apparently mature sperm. Over 400 dragonflies were individually marked and this showed that many of them returned to the same roosting sites for up to at least 23 successive nights. The sites were dead twigs on trees which offered good fields of view. By using pinned, dead individuals and by altering the positions of roosting twigs, evidence was obtained to suggest that the locations of sites are learnt visually and that they do not provide any special microclimatic benefit. The possibility that communal roosting serves an anti-predator function in a species which may remain reproductively inactive throughout a long dry season is considered.

N2  - The reproductive behaviour of I. graellsii in a high-density population at Lourizàn (Pontevedra, Spain) and under laboratory conditions was studied. Copulation duration varies between 74 and more than 250 min. Stage 11 lasts for 2-8 min and takes place 12.6+0.84 min before the end. Oviposition is made by unaccompanied females, usually in the morning, before the initiation of reproductive activity (94% of copulations take place between 1:30 and 5:30 h after solar noon). It has been shown that andromorph females are not recognized as females by males. Such females mimic the behaviour of males and, in the insectary, rarely copulate twice in the same day, as is usual for heteromorph females. The high morphological and behavioural similarity between /. graellsii and I. elegans, and the fact that copulation between male /. elegans and female /. graellsii is possible indicate that they may be sibling species.

N2  - Observations were carried out at a stream in the southern Transvaal, Republic of South Africa, on 3 sympatric spp. Males were given unique colour combinations which enabled their recognition without recapture. P. citricola and P i. inconspicuum males established territories which they occupied throughout the day and from which they exluded conspecific males, and within which they allowed oviposition by other species. New territories were established each day. Detailed analyses of territorial behaviour were carried out by noting the types and outcome of 84 flights by 3(5 P. cilricola and 149 flights by 2 Q P i. inconspicuunu during285 min of observation. Flight activities consisted of patrolling (11.9% and 4.7% of all flights respectively), shifting (26.2% and 14.1%), investigatory (45.2% and 81.2%) and feeding flights (16.7% in P. cilricola only). Observations of the behaviour of 23 <5 P. salisburyense showed that it was non-territorial. The flight season of P. salisburyense was from early Oct, 1986 to mid-May 1987, and P. cilricola and P. i. inconspicuum from early Nov. 1986 to mid-May 1987.

N2  - In Natal, South Africa (30°E, 29°S), the land elevation ranges from 0m a.s.l. to 3000 m a.s.l. along an E-W 200 km transect. The area is in Zonobiome 11. It is strongly modified by a montane climate at the higher elevations, and has a subtropical/ tropical climate at sea level. A total of 117 spp. was recorded across this transect. The narrow coastal plain (< 200 m a.s.l.) supported 86 spp. From 200-1400 m elevation there was fairly constant species richness of about 43 spp. dropping to 4 spp. between 2400-3000 m. The Libellulidae accounted for 44% of all spp., and declined from 50% in the 0-200 m belt to 25% at 2800-3000 m. The Coenagrionidae accounted for 24% and remained at this level across the whole 3000 ra range. The Aeshnidae accounted for 9% and remained fairly constant at about that level up to 1600 m, thereafter increasing to reach 35% at 3000 m. The Gomphidae accounted for 8%, remaining at that level from 0-1400 m, declining to zero at 1600 m. The Lestidae remained fairly constant at about 5% from 0-1600 m, above which they disappeared. The Chlorolestidae ranged from 1% at 0 m increasing steadily to 25% above 2400 m. The Chlorocyphidae, Calopterygidae, Protoneuridae and the Corduliidae are consistently rare, low-altitude families, while the Platycnemididae is a rare middle-altitude family. The Lestidae, Libellulidae, Corduliidae and Gomphidae are moderate-climate families, while the Coenagrionidae is equally tolerant of all climatic conditions. -The Aeshnidae tolerate the harsher climate of the high altitudes, and the Gondwana relic family Chlorolestidae is a conspicuous feature of the very high altitudes.

N2  - Larvae of E. cyathigerum, even when densely aggregated, exhibit no evident spacing or agonistic behaviour. Cannibalism is rare or non-existent among healthy larvae, even after they have been denied food for several days and are exhibiting heightened feeding activity. When exposed to high densities of prey, larvae show no detectable sign of "wasteful killing" (sensu JOHNSON et al., 1975, Ecology 56: 1081-1093). The feeding-related behaviour of larvae of £. cyathigerum, as exhibited in the laboratory, differs markedly from that of Pyrrhosoma nymphula and Lestes sponsa (which themselves differ inter se) in some respects and resembles it in others.

N2  - Yellow and white plastic bowls of 18 cm diameter, filled with water containing ethyl glycol plus a detergent, attracted 171 immature adults 101 <5, 70 $ of Aeshna cyanea and of 6 Sympetrum spp. in a pine plantation in Poznan, Poland, during a 14 days warm spell (late Sept.-early Oct.). Yellow traps were 1.8 times more effective than white ones. Dragonflies were trapped when attacking Diptera or Hymenoptera alighting on the water surface. Only mature odonate individuals were able to escape and avoid drawning. It is suggested that trapping could be adopted as a supplementary technique in assessing the anisopteran fauna in areas with low vegetation.

N2  - In the laboratory, larvae of the Western Palaearctic P. nymphula were exposed to conditions of temperature and food conducive to uninterrupted development, and to one of three, constant photoperiods; 13.5 h (equivalent to either equinox). 18 h (14 May and 30 July) and 19.5 h (5 June and 8 July), and their responses were interpreted in the light of seasonal development in the field. Synchronised entry to F-0 (the final instar) in late summer is caused by the summer arrest in F-l (the penultimate instar) that is induced by exposure in F-l, but not in F-2 or F-3, to 19.5 h, but not to 13.5 h. The refractoriness of F-l declines during summer so that the response to 19.5 h changes abruptly during late August (16-16.5 h; maximum daily increment of change of 5 min/day), when F-0 is entered promptly. Termination of emergence in summer is caused by the long-day arrest that prevents F-l larvae from entering F-0 during the second half of May (18 h or more). Photoperiod does not evidently affect the mean duration of F-2 or F-3, or the onset and rate of metamorphosis in spring. Persistent exposure to 19.5 h during their summer arrest causes about 25% of F-l larvae to undergo a supernumerary moult, still within F-l; such individuals can be distinguished from normal F-l (after the supernumerary moult) by their larger wing-sheaths; Supernumerary moulting occurs also in the field. Remaining unknown are; the responses of F-0 which prevent emergence (i.e. the onset of metamorphosis) in autumn; and the role, if any, of changing photoperiods in regulating rate of development or sensitivity to absolute photoperiod.

N2  - Flight activity patterns were studied under semi-natural conditions in a large outdoor field cage in which individuals were found to show normal behaviour. Sexual differences in usage of time and space and the influence of temperature were studied. Before solar noon males were mainly active away from the pond, where they searched for females if temperature was high enough. Most pair-formation was seen during this period. Around noon and in the early afternoon, acticity shifted towards the pond, where some more pairs were formed. Throughout the afternoon male activity decreased, and shorter, localized flights became relatively more important. Male maximal flight activity coincided with solar noon and peak reproductive activity. Females remained almost inactive throughout the morning. However, their activity increased rapidly from noon onwards and largely exceeded male activity in the late afternoon. Female activity at the pond was always low compared to that in the surroundings. Females preferred more overgrown parts of the cage than did males, and selected higher perches. Body-surface temperature had a positive exponential effect on flight activity within the interval 20°-40° C, the effect being stronger in males than in females. Higher temperature also had a positive effect on the selected perch height. The results demonstrate that observations made only at the waterside can give a misleading impression of total activity. The revealed sexual differences in activity patterns are discussed in relation to mate-finding strategies in both sexes.

N2  - The female perching behaviour in Orthetrum coerulescens, Crocothemis erythraea and Sympetrum vulgatum in high density situations can be explained by habitat and situation. In O. coerulescens 86.2% of the females perched immediately after copulation. After disturbance of the preceding copulation'and in the presence of rival males, the perching duration (PD) was longer. In C. erythraea at sites without perches all females immediately started to oviposit whereas at sites with emergent vegetation 75.8% remained perched. PD was longer in cases of male interference with the preceding copulation. In S. vulgatum after tandem oviposition at sites with emergent vegetation, 24.2% of all females settled on a perch site. This behaviour occurred more often after disturbance of the preceding tandem oviposition and in the presence of rival males. In all species PD did not change with multiple matings. Perching before the start of oviposition may serve as a tactic to evade male interference or to assess predator pressure at the oviposition site.

N2  - Previous studies have suggested that zygopteran wingclapping serves a social function; however, it may also contribute to behavioral thermoregulation. Two brief studies were performed to determine whether wingclapping rates increase in response to endogenous and exogenous heat sources. In both instances wingclapping increased as predicted, suggesting that the behavior has a cooling effect.

The latter was that in which a damselfly flew around and landed at the same perching point, and was subdivided into patrolling flights and encounter flights, which included feeding and interference. Both males and females, when sexually immature, stayed on the forest floor. The frequency of cruising flights of mature males increased toward noon and then remained at rather high levels. The frequency of revolving flights in mature males increased in the morning, attained a peak around noon, and decreased in the afternoon. However, there was no diurnal rhythm in female flight behavior in the immature or in the mature stage. A few interferences were observed between the immatures. Male-male interference on the forest floor showed a diurnal rhythm in accordance with the mating behavior of mature males. Solitary males interfered in copulation there. On the other hand, solitary males were also observed on the shoreline throughout the day, while few lone females were found. Few of them, arriving from the forest, interfered in the oviposition in tandem. A lek-like system in L. sponsa is discussed in view of these observations.

N2  - Based on countings and mark-release-recapture experiments the effects of intestinal eugregarines and ectoparasitic water-mite larvae on zygopteran imagines were studied in habitats on the W coast of Norway, In Enallagma cyathigerum and Coenagrion hastulatum, the larval mites attach during emergence: imagines on their maiden flight revealed the highest numbers of attached mites; the figures appeared to decline in the course of adult life. Heavily loaded individuals disappeared during the prereproductive and the succeeding reproductive phase. Pyrrhosoma nymphula and Lestes sponsa on their maiden flight carried low numbers of mites; the infestation increased consequent on repetitive visits to the water for reproduction, and the number of mites tended to rise with increasing adult age. In all Zygoptera the load of gregarines increased with advancing adult age owing to recurrent ingestion of infective gregarine oocysts; the gregarines influence zygopteran longevity. No individual carrying very high numbers of both gregarines and mites was ever recorded. Parasitism by mites and gregarines influences community structure of zygopterans through selective pressure against heavily-loaded hosts. — In wet cool summers there was virtually a non-appearance of propagating stages of the gregarines. Production of infective gregarine oocysts depends on the heat budget of the zygopteran flying season: the intrahost processes leading to union in syzygy demand ambient air temperatures of 18-20° C or higher, while the extra-host development of oocysts over the subsequent 2-3 weeks requires temperatures not much below. As for damages inflicted by mites, a corresponding dependence on warm weather could not be demonstrated. Ruptures of the midgut wall by gregarine overinfection involve injuries and partial dissolution also of the zygopteran epidermis, which is recognizable in the field as a discoloration of the zygopteran abdomen. Lesions to the midgut wall by gregarines and epidermal damage by mites were most tangible during periods of fine weather; enfeeblement of the hosts is presumed to be due to desiccation.

N2  - Interspecific interactions were studied in 3 localities, where there are C. splendens populations with 2 female forms. The homeochromic form, possibly more vulnerable to predation because of its conspicuousness, gains advantage over the heterochromic form because it offers a better reproductive isolation. In fact homeochromic females sexually attract heterospecific males less often than the other females do and so are probably less often involved in heterospecific matings. This is the result of their wing colouration, variable according to the congeneric species sympatric in the single sites, which mimics the wings of C. haemorrhoidalis males and which is very different from those of C. virgo females.

N2  - No significant relationships were found between either mean egg weight or clutch size and measures of female'skeletal size, when controlling for the effects of sample date. However, for particularly large clutches, abdomen size may have had a limiting effect on clutch size. Mean egg weight and clutch size were both significantly negatively correlated with sample date. Body size declined through the season, but females that visited the study ponds late in the season laid smaller clutches of smaller eggs than those that arrived early in the season, irrespective of size. Possible explanations for this are discussed. In particular, climatological factors may exert a strong influence on egg production and deposition in damselflies and dragonflies. Clutch size is likely to be closely related to the inter-clutch interval, and therefore to the pattern of sunny and cloudy days during a female’s reproductive lifespan, since reproductive activity occurs only on warm, sunny days.

N2  - Larval Odon. were identified from quantitative samples of water lettuce made from a single pond. 3 spp. of Zygoptera accounted for more individuals but less biomass than 4 spp. of Anisoptera. Numbers of larvae were highest in the winter when smallest size classes predominated, and lowest in the spring and summer when larger size classes were present. Size class data indicated a probable spring emergence for Telebasis byersi and Pachydiplax longipennis and an autumnal emergence for Coryphaeschna adnexa. Foregut dissections of freshly caught larvae revealed identifiable remains of certain prey, the commonest being larvae of Mansonia mosquitoes which attach to roots of P. stratiotes.

N2  - T. annulata either increases or reduces the exposed surface of its body to the sun by orienting at various angles with respect to both the sun rays and the horizontal plane. Since the abdomen-raised position is observed in both sexes and is also adopted far from the reproductive habitat, it is probably not used as a territorial display but only as a means to warm up or cool the body temperature. The ability of thermoregulating by a wide variety of positions probably accounts for the long diurnal activity period in the population observed. Several libellulid species regulate internal temperature by varying the postural angle of their bodies relative to the sun’s rays. In the warmer period of the day, some point the abdomen toward the sun, and by so doing they expose to the sunlight a minimal surface, this position being known as the "obelisk position” (e.g. ANSELIN, 1986; CORBET, 1962; EDA, 1983; GONZALEZ SORIANO, 1987; HEINRICH & CASEY, 1978; JACOBS, 1955; KITAWAKI, 1973; MAY, 1977, 1978; MIYAKAWA, 1965; NEEDHAM & WESTFALL, 1955; TSUBAKI, 1986). The abdomen raised position may alternatively be adopted to increase the body surface exposed to the sun (ROWE & WINTERBOURN, 1981). Some other species apparently do not markedly raise their body above the horizontal, and they either increase or diminish the body surface exposed to the sun by varying the body angle below the horizontal (e.g. HEINRICH & CASEY, 1978). The abdomen raised position is also reported for some gomphids (CORBET, 1962; TESTARD, 1975; AIDA, 1974) and zygopterans (Calopterygidae, HEYMER, 1972; Euphaeidae, HEYMER, 1975). We have observed it in a number of species, including Sympetrum meridionale, Diplacodes trivialis. Celithemis eponina, Brachymesia gravida and Erythrodiplax minuscula. In Aphylla williamsoni and Onychogomphus forcipatus unguiculatus, the abdomen may be also raised, but apparently not to the extent of the libellulid species (unpublished). The obelisk position is generally believed to have a thermoregulatory function, although JOHNSON (1962) has shown that by this position the males of Pachydiplax longipennis keep control of their territories and HEYMER (1975) and PRASAD & GHOSH (1982) for various species, including Trithemis annulata, maintain the same.HEYMER (1975) explicitly doubts that the obelisk position may have a thermoregulatory function. MAY (1977), with reference to Micrathyria suggests both functions.

And here we are again to offer you, on behalf of our dragonfly family, this special Tribute Issue of the journal that you helped to set up more than two decades ago, and which continues to be one of your responsibilities ever since. It was back in September 1985 that we havefirst made plansfor this issue: we wanted to have it published exactly on your 80th birthday, December 13, 1990. But, unfortunately, we did not succeed. Unforeseen communication difficulties in postal traffic prevented the realisation of the original idea. Even so, we hope that the present collection ofpapers by some of your colleagues and friends from so many countries of the world will stand witness to the worldwide respect for your personality and your dedication to Science, and to the appreciation your very significant contribution to Odonatology enjoys in all quarters of the globe. It is the biogeographic organisation of our planet, as revealed by dragonflies, that you have uncovered and explained to us ever since 1951, in almost 200 publications, among which 7 books. This is a personal opus that only few odonatologists have ever achieved.

N2  - Adults of the pan-African sympetrine B. leucosticta often accompany large vertebrates moving slowly through open grassland or, less often, through shallow water. Such ‘accompanying’ behaviour, which is shown by solitary individuals and groups, males and females, and immature and mature adults, varies with respect to wind direction and substrate in ways that indicate that the vertebrate is usually perceived as a token stimulus attracting the dragonflies to places where small flying insects are rendered accessible as prey. Certain and probable examples of accompanying behaviour in other Anisoptera are discussed.

N2  - Lifetime fecundity was studied in 50 females. In , I. graellsii, fecundity is a positive function of reproductive lifespan (number of days after first oviposition) and body length. First clutch size is positively related to female body length; the age has no effect. The subsequent egg clutches are positively related to the inter-clutch interval (days from last oviposition) and body length, and negatively to female age. Maximum egg production is obtained with clutches every day. Consequently, females would maximize their lifetime egg production by minimizing their interclutch intervals rather than by maximizing the size of each clutch. Since the fecundity is positively related to female size, and larval density is negatively related to adult size, there may be a density dependent regulatory process of the population size.

N2  - P. flavescens on Easter Island exhibits peculiar life history adaptations not documented from populations elsewhere. Adults seem to have abandoned the long-distance dispersal behaviour for which this circumtropical dragonfly species is notorious. They are relatively poor flyers, show a tendency to aggregate and forage in windsheltered areas, and display a perching reflex at sudden windrises. — The sp. reproduces in the major crater lakes, as well as in several smaller ponds that occur scattered around the island. In the crater lakes, young larvae are preyed upon by introduced Gambusia fish. Medium to fullgrown larvae escape predation (through protection provided by abdominal spines?), but are subject to chronic starvation because of the overall scarcity of suitable prey. — Selection for non-migrating behaviour may explain the behaviour of Easter Island P. flavescens. Poor larval nutrition is considered to have been the key epigenetic initiating factor.

At the oviposition site during windy weather males may spontaneously settle in a horizontal position in front of the female. In this situation predation risk from approaching predators (green frogs) was greatly increased. Disturbance experiments with groups of pairs with both types of male positions show that tandems with male upright make a speedier escape than pairs with males horizontal. In pairs of the latter kind males have to take up an inclined or upright position before take off, so that the pair remains longer within range of an approaching predator.

N2  - Whereas most European Anisoptera emerge hanging down, Zygoptera and Gomphidae during emergence assume the upright position, and thus are able to emerge on horizontal substrates. Both Erythromma species are known to emerge on floating Nymphaea and Hydrocharis leaves, E. viridulum on weeds floating on the water surface. Only the top of the head and thorax of the larvae may be in the air during emergence. Present observations confirm this procedure for Enallagma cyathigerum on floating Elodea, and new records are added for Cercion lindeni and Ischnura elegans. All species however prefer vertical stems or flowers; emergence from floating weeds in Zygoptera seems to be typical of individuals living in open fields of weeds far from the bank, constituting a protection from predation by fish.

N2  - The haemolymph protein concentration increased throughout most of the intermoult period of the final instar larvae, but decreased sharply a few days before emergence. Treatment with Farnesyl methyl ether caused no significant change in the haemolymph protein concentration. However, cauterization of the medial neurosecretory cells (MNC) of the brain caused depletion, while administration of an aqueous extract of corpora cardiaca (CC) elevated the level of haemolymph protein. Cauterization of the MNC and removal of the CC caused significant reduction in the midgut protease activity. These results collectively suggest the profound influence of the MNC hormone on protein metabolism, mostly mediated through the midgut protease activity.

Consequently, the family includes now 7 genera, with 14 spp. All the taxa are described and/or commented upon, the genera are keyed and their phylogenetic affinities are shown in a dendrogram. The monophyletic origin of the family in the Upper Carboniferous or Lower Permian is tentatively assumed and the Protozygoptera Tillyard is considered its sister group.

N2  - The genus is divided into 2 subgenera, viz. Risiocnemis (typified by R. serrata [Hagen]) and Igneocnemis subg. nov. (typified by R. ignea [Brauer]). The subgenus Risiocnemis is revised. 14 of the known 15 spp., incl. 10 new spp., are classified into 4 species groups, viz. (I) appendiculata group ( appendiculala [Brauer], erythrura [Brauer], praeusta sp. n., confusa sp. n., kiautai sp. n., moroensis sp. n.); — (2) orator group (orator sp. n.); — (3) rolandmuelleri group (rolandmuelleri sp. n.); and — (4) serrata group (serrata [Hagen], asahinai Kitagawa, gracilis sp. n., varians sp. n., pulchra sp. n., laguna sp. n.). R. elegans Kitagawa is not placed into any group, since no material was available for examination. Of gracilis sp. n. only $ and from moroensis sp. n. only $ are known; from the other spp. n. both sexes are described. Females of R. appendiculata and R. erythrura are described for the first time. R. cornuta (Brauer), the lectotype of which is designated, is synonymized with R. serrata (Hagen). Separate keys to the males and females are given and a review of studies on the genus is presented.

N2  - 20 small ponds were constructed at the Woodwalton Fen National Nature Reserve in 1961 and 3 elsewhere in the reserve in 1974 and 1977. The Twenty Ponds were allowed to develop naturally except for scrub control on their perimeters. In the other (Heathfield) ponds emergent plants were planted immediately after their construction. The ponds were visited near noon on fine days as often as possible and the numbers of adult and teneral dragonflies were recorded. Of the 20 spp. breeding within 6200 m of the Twenty Ponds, 6 bred in all the ponds, 4 bred irregularly, 3 rarely, 5 visited the ponds but did not breed and two were never seen on the ponds. The dragonfly community of the Twenty Ponds went through a short pioneer stage in which Ischnura elegans and Sympetrum striolatum were virtually the only visitors and breeders, then a developmental stage of 11 yrs in which 6 other spp. colonised the ponds and in which Pyrrhosoma nymphula and Brachytron pratense appeared and disappeared, and finally a climax stage, which has lasted 15 yrs, in which 5 spp. breed regularly, 1 frequently and 2 occasionally. In the 3 Heathfield ponds the pioneer stage was eliminated by planting emergent plants following construction, but in 2 of the ponds a fourth senescent stage followed the climax owing to colonisation by reeds (Phragmites australis). All 23 ponds varied considerably in their simple aquatic vegetation but their odon. faunas were very similar. No one plant sp. was necessary for larval development and most spp. bred successfully when waterweed was totally absent. The partial dependence of the odon. fauna on surrounding populations was evident, notably after the exceptional drought of 1976. Records made throughout the 27 yr period showed that the value of highest steady density for each sp. was remarkably similar for all 20 ponds. The highest steady densities of the spp. of the Twenty Ponds were also very similar to those at the Heathfield ponds and at ponds at Arne in Dorset in the 1950s. The behavioural basis of highest steady density and its ecological consequences are discussed. The implications for conservation strategy of this study on suboptimal populations are outlined.

N2  - Larval development of S. alpestris was studied in a semipermanent pond and 2 temporary pools in boreal Sweden. In the pond, several cohorts co-occurred with a life cycle of 3 or 4 years. The temporary pool populations were very small and included only a single larval cohort. The presence of nearly fullgrown larvae after drought periods as long as 3 months documented survival in the dry sediment. As the studied pools freeze solid during winter, the larvae must have survived for about 6 months in ice or frozen sediment. The long larval development of 5. alpestris is unique for insects in temporary pools. It is predicted that the slow larval development characteristic for many odonates, and not the direct mortality from extreme abiotic conditions, limits their success in exploiting this environment.

Tyndall scattering occurs when a beam of white light encounters very small transparent particles whose properties differ from those of the surrounding medium. If the particles have dimensions about equal to or somewhat less than the wavelength of blue light (i.e. about 400 nm), they will reflect, or scatter, more of the short-wave than of the long-wave components of white light. In Odon. blue colours are usually due to Tyndall-active particles within the subcuticular epidermis. If the particles are underlain by a layer of dark pigment the reflected light is blue, but if the pigment is yellow, the reflected light appears green. The situation in the genera Diphlebia, Austrolestes, Enallagma, Erythemis and Libellula is stated.

N2  - More than 32,000 fertilized eggs from Erythemis simplicicollis (Say), Libellula cyanea Fabr., L. incesta Hag. and Perithemis tenera (Say) were maintained at several regimes until eclosion. Between 20-35°C, development was progressively faster at each higher temperature; at this thermal range incidences of successful eclosions were also highest. At 15°C hatching was either greatly delayed or prevented, and at 40°C, no eclosions were noted; these temperatures mark the approximate lower and upper thermal thresholds for eclosion in these spp. Hatching peaks occurred during the first 1-3 days of the eclosion period. Numbers of eggs per clutch varied widely within and between spp.; clutch sizes ranged from a mean of620 for E. simplicicollis to 1366 for L. cvanea.

N2  - The African dragonfly, Z. natalensis. inhabits waterfalls and rapids. For oviposition at rocky river courses, current-washed mats of plant roots are of great importance. Because of strongly varying water levels and currents the oviposition sites are limited and their suitability is unpredictable. — Males hover over rapids, where the females appear. After copulation on the wing the pairs look for an oviposition site in tandem. As a rule, they separate for oviposition. Guarded by the male, the female settles on roots or stalks and allows the discharged eggs to be washed away by the current. The eggs are covered by a gelatinous secretion which expands rapidly in contact with water and causes the eggs to stick to the soil or roots. Apart from this, there are other types of oviposition: the female may stick her eggs directly to the substrate through movements of the abdomen whilst in a sitting position, or position the eggs in the main current while dipping in flight. If the searching tandem is disturbed, it frequently flies away. Disturbed tandems still manage to oviposit. In this case the male often stays in contact. Oviposition in tandem occurs only in flight and is less successful than the other 3 types. — The plasticity of oviposition behaviour is an adaptation to the high intraspecific competition between males and to the limitation and unpredictability of suitable oviposition sites. Oviposition in tandem occurs only when the risk of take-over by another male is great.

N2  - The National Botanic Gardens, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa are being partially ecologically landscaped. Odon. are one of the subject groups for conservation. Their behaviour relative to the topography and thermal patterns of the landscape were studied. Several spp. of Anisoptera used the vegetation, rocks, gravel and sand substrates for perching. There were distinct species- and sex-specific behavioural responses to the shape and features of the landscape. By selecting certain microhabitats. and substrates, the dragonflies gained extra warmth late in the afternoon, particularly late in the season. Rock-basking was particularly prominent, as was aggregating in a sheltered hollow. These behavioural patterns apparently allowed longer periods of activity, especially for hunting crepuscular prey and searching for suitable roosting sites. Rocks and the hollow were not used at night when cold-air drainage made the habitat too cold. These behaviours are important in the lives of the dragonflies, to the extent that local topography and landscape features should be considered when managing areas for dragonfly conservation.

N2  - In the course of postembryonic development of an odonate larva, the number of antennal segments increases from 3 in newly hatched larvae to 7 in most full-grown larvae. New segments are formed through division of existing segments with the construction of new joints. 2 growth or division centers in the odon. antenna are responsible for this joint formation. A third growth center does not form new joints, but stimulates extension of existing segments. — Ontogenetic studies on 2 spp. of Cordulegaster demonstrate the phylogenetic significance of antennal growth pattern at 2 levels of dragonfly taxonomy. At the family level, differences in the operating sequence of the 2 division centers determine a variety of basic antennal growth patterns. The sequence of divisions observed in C. insignis and C. pictus is in agreement with the position of the Cordulegastridae in the currently accepted genealogy of the order. — Minor but significant interspecific differences in antennal development among W. Palaearctic Cordulegaster constitute a key character to differentiate between taxa belonging to the C. boltonii and C. bidentatus species groups. Biometric analysis of immature larvae of C. ins ignis (C. bidentatus group) and C. pictus (C. boltonii group) explain these differences as being due to a subtle difference in the original position of the division centers, rather than to allemetric growth of antennal segments during larval development.

N2  - Copulation in E. cyathigerum can be divided into 3 stages. Stage I, which is correlated with the removal of rival sperm from the female’s storage organs, shows a greater degree of variability of duration than later stages. Such variability is dependent in part on the time of day: copulations occurring late in the day are significantly shorter. The number of rhythmic movements occurring during stage I is positively correlated with the duration of the stage whereas their frequency is negatively correlated. In stage II, during which the ejaculate is transferred to the female, the number of rhythmic movements remains more or less constant at about 20 and their frequency is negatively correlated with the overall duration of the stage. In stage III no movement occurs but the duration is positively correlated with that of stage I. Some of the factors which may account for the variability of copulation are considered.

N2  - The chromosome cytology of the sp. (n<5 = 14, no m; R1 $ = 26) is compared with that prevailing in odon. pioneer spp., in spp. in the process of expanding their range (which is coupled with infraspeciation), and in those considered to represent Pleistocene ("glacial”) faunal relics. While in h. freyi the chromosome number and the recombination index (Rl) are stabilized at the modal adaptive level of the genus, this is not the case in the taxa referable to any of the 3 said groups. On the other hand, the karyotypic features of h. freyi do agree with those so far known in odon. spp. of trans-eurasiatic or holarctic distribution. The hitherto available information on its habitat requirements and behaviour is also taken into consideration, and it is preliminarily concluded that h.freyi 'is neither a pioneer sp,, nora recent introduction into the European fauna, but rather a trans-eurasiatic taxon, whose post-Pleistocene disjunction is the result of its specialized microhabitat requirements, associated with shallow, essentially stenothermic (sections of) subalpine lakes and ponds, characterized by a rather complex biotic community and by a climax odon. association. The paucity of the hitherto known localities in Europe is tentatively ascribed to the peculiar adult diurnal activity rhythm (which was hitherto unknown and, therefore, greatly reduced the chances of detection of a resident population), and to the rarity of the required type of habitats. — An annotated bibliography on the taxon is appended.

N2  - Some aspects of the reproductive behaviour and genital structures of Z. petiolatum are described from observations made at Madurai in southern India. Sexually active males patrolled continuously over small permanent pools from about 45 min before to 10-15 min after sunset, interacting aggressively with other males. Copulation was brief and aerial, and it was immediately followed by guarded epiphytic oviposition. A few immature individuals commonly appeared in flight at the water from about 10 min after sunset, remaining there until after the departure of all sexually active dragonflies. — Females possess extended and cleft sub-genital plates and males have correspondingly elongated hamules. Internally females are equipped with a relatively small bursa and a pair of spermathecae supplied through a T-shaped duct. The penis bears a pair of partially inflatable cornua and a bifurcated flagellum. Each branch of the flagellum terminates in a large hook and has a helically twisted membrane running along its outer margin. Some functional interpretations of these structures are discussed. The behaviour and morphology resemble those of Tholymis tillarga which occurs in the same region, but the species do not normally share the same habitats.

N2  - The reproductive behaviour of the neotropical P. mooma has been studied at a farm pond in southern Brazil. Males, ready for reproduction, arrive in the course of the forenoon at the water in search of a suitable oviposition substrate, such as a floating mat of algae or emergent root-felt of water plants. The site is selected visually and then examined thoroughly by repeated touches with the tips of the hind legs. If the substrate is found appropriate it will become the center of a vigorously defended territory. Sexual behaviour follows a well-defined sequence of male-female interactions including courtship display, copulation and postcopulatory activities. In addition to the main pathway, a number of alternative steps exist. Thus, besides the main situation leading to copulation, 3 precopulatory behavioural elements may occur. The mean duration of copulation is 15 ± 6 s. Oviposition is performed attended and may last up to 170 s if undisturbed.

N2  - E. civile is a nonterritorial damselfly whose males exhibit contact-guarding, and the tandem-pairs oviposit alone or in small groups. Three possible factors influencing the formation of aggregations were investigated; single-male interference, female oviposition efficiency and predation risk. Although aggregating reduced the risk of interference and may lower predation risk, for this species, oviposition efficiency was reduced under crowded conditions. This reduction in efficiency was primarily due to the incidental contact that occurred among ovipositing pairs. Because contact-guarding was effective at preventing takeovers, and males had few mating opportunities on a given day, males as well as females should prefer conditions favoring high oviposition efficiency. Future research on oviposition behaviour should include a measure of oviposition efficiency, because it can be an important factor influencing site selection.

N2  - Most of the 153 South African odon. spp. (the taxonomic status of 2 of which is uncertain) are widespread African elements, whose ranges extend into the southern tip of the continent especially along the eastern seaboard, where there are suitable warm and moist climatic conditions. The endemics make up only 18% of the total (14% Zygoptera, 4% Anisoptera). The Cape, which is well-known for its high level of endemicity in many plant and animal groups, makes up only 9% of the total odon. fauna. 4 zygopteran and I anisopteran Cape endemics are listed in the 1990 1UCN Red List, Also listed is I montane Natal Drakensberg endemic zygopteran and 1 highly localized coastal Natal anisopteran. Many of the endemics occur in water catchment wilderness areas or nature reserves, and are not immediately threatened with extinction, although the long-term global changes are of particular concern for southern African spp. Much further research is required on the exact distribution and abundance of all spp., especially the lUCN-catagorized ones. Although loss of wetlands has been severe in South Africa, farm dams have, on the contrary, benefitted many spp. A pilot scheme to develop a dragonfly reserve in a botanic garden is also underway.

N2  - The eggs of I. rufostigma are produced in the ovarioles and passed down the common lateral ducts into the lateral oviducts that posteriorly open into a common median oviduct (oviductus communis). This ultimately leads into the ’8th complex’ restricted to the 8th segment of the abdomen. The components of the ’8th complex’ are the vagina, its évagination the bursa copulatrix, and the spermatheca, the subsequent évagination of the bursa. The sperms are deposited by males into the bursa copulatrix, which together with the spermatheca stores them. The anteriormost part of the vagina has an oval-shaped lumen into which the oviductus communis and the bursa copulatrix open and where the fertilization of eggs takes place. Two accessory glands, present in the 9th segment, open into the posterior part of the vagina — the genital atrium — and pour a secretion which bathes the eggs passing for oviposition. The musculature associated with the ’8th complex’ was studied with the intent of observing its functional abilities.

N2  - About 120 breeding sites were investigated with regard to certain biological and physical features. The upper vertical distribution (2240 m a.s.l.) coincides approximately with the natural tree line; the occurrence of larvae depends on the presence of aquatic vegetation and organic mud. The sp. colonises a great variety of habitats such as moorland pools, peat diggings, ditches, slowly running rivulets in inclined bogs and alpine lakes of different sizes. The water surface at a breeding site may vary from a few square metres to several hectares; the mean depth is 29 cm (range 1 -120 cm; range in 66% of the sites 1 -20 cm). On average the water is slightly acid (mean pH 5.0, range pH 3.3-93), the concentration of electrolytes is low (mean electric conductivity 64(iS, range 5-370pS, range in 66% of the sites 5- -35pS). The same is true of the concentration of carbonate (mean 34 ppm CaCOj, range 0-243 ppm CaCOj, range in 67% of the sites 0-18 ppm CaCO,). The vegetation consists of various aquatic plant communities, characterised by emergent, stalky plant structures (mean height 29 cm above the water, range 10-70 cm; coverage 5-100%, mean 48%). A. juncea appears more versatile with respect to its habitat requirements than other alpine odon. spp., but it cannot be considered a generalist. The observations are compared with those from the Black Forest bogs, Germany.

N2  - Females in tandem or having been in tandem, single females laying eggs and juvenile females can demonstrate refusal display to conspecific males and those of certain closely related spp. Refusal display has some successive states depending on the male’s persistence. The responses of P. pennipes males to the refusal display by females were studied by means of 11 models. These differed in the presence and position of the abdomen. Female models with abdomens that rise at angles of 45" and 90" obtained the largest number of negative reactions. At an extreme state of refusal display (abdomen rises to maximal angle) the number of positive reactions by a male rose, but seizure of the female in tandem was hampered. Males demonstrate a threat display that is similar to female refusal display. In the natural environment threat display probably decreases the frequency of homosexual contacts, whereas refusal display of females leads to an economy of male time and energy.

N2  - Prior to the establishment of a territory, males select a suitable oviposition substrate which is detected by visual and tactile stimuli. Video films analysed in slow motion revealed that the individuals extend their hind legs while making short dips over the oviposition substrate, touching the ground for 0.01 – 0.02 s with the tarsi. Females use their legs in the same manner during oviposition. By setting up experimental oviposition sites it could be shown that the individuals are first guided by their visual and then by their tactile sensory system. Pancake-like substrates consisting of fine structured, emergent material completely surrounded by water are accepted visually and arc subsequently examined physically with the tarsi. Choice experiments with various materials revealed that only those substrates which have a gelatinous surface are accepted. Following site selection the males perch nearby, perform patrolling flights and chase conspeciftc intruders, while the females oviposit at such localities.

N2  - The study was conducted at 2 geothermically heated sites in British Columbia, Canada. Because of different thermal regimes, the sp. has a l-yr life cycle at Halcyon Hotsprings, and a 3-yr life cycle at Albert Canyon, At Albert Canyon, males mating early in the day did not differ significantly in size from males selected at random from the population later in the day. At Halcyon Hotsprings, males mating early in the day were significantly smaller that those selected at random later in the day. Males were also smaller, in general, at Halcyon Hotsprings than at Albert Canyon, but females were not. Differences in larval phenology may have led to changes in the relationship between male size and pairing success between the two sites. Comparative studies of lifetime mating success between populations having differing life cycles may aid in separating the effects of size, age and survivorship on mating success in nonlerritorial odonates.

N2  - Observations are presented on oviposition and mate guarding in the Camargue. France. After a short copulation at the oviposition site, females immediately commence exophytic oviposition whilst being non-contact guarded by their mates, and they generally suffer a high level of interference from other males. Although a trend was found, guarded females did not have a significant advantage over non-guarded in terms of either reduced interference rates or an increased number of egg-laying dips made. Predation rates on 2 and tandem pairs of C. erythraea by other dragonfly spp. were measured. Tandem pairs and ovipositing females were particularly vulnerable, providing hard evidence for a survival cost associated with reproduction.

N2  - Morphological variability was studied in laboratory-reared adults. The size of the postocular spots and the antehumeral stripes was surveyed in 1064 E, individuals, as was the size of the black dorsal spot of the eighth abdominal segment in 994 F, and F, females. Total body length was measured in 884 6 and 1404 2 from F, to F4 generations. Results indicated significant differences among families in all morphological characters, suggesting the existence of genetic variability. Most individuals had no postocular spots, and many males had incomplete antehumeral lines. Female phenotypes are described and figured, and an identification key is provided, based on these morphological characters. Heritability of body length was estimated to be about 0.5 in females and 0.4 in males. No differences in body length were observed between female phenotypes when compared within families. Some aberrant specimens are described.

N2  - C. freyi is compared with C. hylas by means of all hitherto described structural differences. None of these could be confirmed, therefore C.freyi and C. hylas are considered conspecific.Thc sspp. of C. hylas (hylas, freyi, meridionale and ussuriense), C. johanssoni (johanssoni, convalescens and bartenevi) and C. glaciale (glaciale and orientale) are analysed. On the basis of the 75-percent rule, no statistically relevant differences between the sspp.can be found, all representing merely clinal variations of monotypical spp. In particular there are only minor differences between the disjunct Central European "freyi" population and the Asiatic ”hylas” populations. The synonymy of the 3 taxa is added. Zoogcographically C. hylas is not considered a glacial relic, but rather a Manchurian faunal element and an arboreal taiga sp. having undergone 2 postglacial disjunctions (in the Northern Alps and on the Yamal Peninsula). Other palaearctic spp. with a similar postglacial expansion and/or comparable geographic isolates are discussed in detail, viz. Coenagrion lanceolatum, Aeshna caerulea, Somatochlora alpestris, S. graeseri, Leucorrhinia orientalis and L. intermedia. These cold-stenothermal spp. expanded from their glacial refuges during the Allerdd interstadial period (12,000 years ago) at the earliest, their regressive phase (occasionally with separation of disjunctive areals) being estimated to commence at the beginning of the Atlantic (7000 – 8000 years ago) at the latest. 2 Siberian dispersal centers and their dragonfly faunal elements are dealt with in detail, viz. the Central Siberian and the Mongol-Kazakhan refuges. Comments are given on the expansion of Calopteryx splendens ancilla Selys, 1853 and on the peculiar postglacial disjunctions of C. s. splendens (Harris, 1782). It is emphasized that all hitherto described Siberian odon. sspp. have to be revised. In palaearctic dragonflies hardly any infraspeciation has taken place during the Postglacial. Most sspp. differentiated as a result of polytopic disjunctions during the Wurm glaciation.

N2  - The coloured wing spot on a sample of males from 2 populations of C. splendens s.l. (Boutonne, France; Ourthe, Belgium) are analysed, using an iterative computation procedure on wing images transferred to a computer memory by a video transducer. The analysis reveals significant differences in apical wing spot extent and total wing spot area, but not in basal wing spot extent. Its sensitivity is such that it permits to identify immigrants, thus potential gene flow, to the native population. The new possibilities for analysis of the complex of C. splendens are briefly discussed.

N2  - The Australasian dragonfly A. brevistyla is compared with its congeners, all geographically distant, and with spp. in other aeshnine and allied anactine genera. The results of these comparisons emphasise its taxonomic isolation, in particular from the South American spp. of Aeshna to which it had been thought to be allied. It appears to be more closely allied to the specialised Papuan and New Caledonian genus Oreaeschna, of which it may represent a forerunner. A new, monotypic subgenus of Aeshna. Adversaeschna, is described to receive it.

N2  - The behaviour of C. latro was studied in the Atlantic rain forest at Lake Dom Helvecia, Minas Gerais, Brazil on 15 and 16 February 1992. The daytime habitat of males consisted of offshore stands of emergent Eleocharis interstincta on which the males perched. They were aggressive to each other and showed site attachment. The average territory was about 9 m long. There appears to be a correlation between lacustrine habitat and territorial behaviour in the Gomphidae. The reason for this is discussed.

N2  - The behaviour of 6 and $ individuals was studied at natural and artificial breeding stites. In order to detect the stimuli by which the adult insects recognize their larval habitats dummies varying in size (0.02-8 m2) and material (black plastic foil, black and white cotton cloth, tulle) were set up in the vicinity of or apart from natural pools. In multiple choice experiments black plastic foil proved highly attractive to both sexes. They exhibited the complete repertoire of behavioural elements which belong to reproduction including site defence and oviposition. Two behavioural elements were analysed quantitatively, that is the number of arrivals and the duration of stay at dummy sites and at natural pools. The males frequented large foil areas more often than small ones and they stayed over them longer. Glass splinters feigning the sparkling light reflections present at natural breeding sites did not enhance the attractiveness of a dummy. In full sunshine a natural pool was preferred to a dummy of about the same size. However, the attractiveness of these sites was reversed when the sun became covered by a cloud. From the results of the choice experiments it may be concluded that the most effective stimuli by which the adult dragonflies recognize suitable oviposition sites comprise a coarse pattern of reflecting areas on dark background. They prefer large areas to small ones. Non-shining black areas have little effect and white ones have none or even repel insects. Sparkling light reflection patterns alone are obviously poor cues, as they evoke only weak responses or none at all.

N2  - Observations were carried out at a stream in the Western Transvaal, Republic of South Africa. 104 6 were given unique colour combinations which enabled recognition without recapture. The positions of males were recorded at each visit. Males established new territories each day but occasionally occupied the same territory for 2 or 3 days. Conspecific males were excluded from the territories but tandem pairs were allowed to oviposit. Detailed analyses of territorial behaviour were carried out by noting the type, duration, outcome and temporal distribution of 165 flights by 2 adult d. Males spent between 12.1% and 14.3% of their territorial occupation in flight (mean 13.3%). Flight activities consisted of patrolling (44.8% of all flights, 58.2% of total flight time and 23.3 flights/h), shifting flights (24.9%, 8.6% and 14.3 flights/h), and investigatory flights towards movements (30.3%, 33.3% and 15.4 flights/h). The mean durations of patrolling, shifting and investigatory flights were 12.2, 2.9 and 18.2 s respectively. The (light season was from mid-September 1989 to mid-June 1990.

N2  - Despite the relatively constant climate of Easter Island the amount of available breeding habitat can vary as can the general activity of P. flavescens. On Easter Island it exhibits typical territorial behaviour at water; females oviposit both in tandem and when "guarded” by a male. Males on Easter Island also defend territories away from water. These appear to be feeding territories, a possible adaptation to the scarcity of suitable prey. Body and wing measurements of 6 Easter Island specimens are compared with those of specimens collected in other parts of the world. They do not suggest significant differences between the populations.

N2  - At the roosting sites 26 tandem formations of males with individuals of 7 other Anisoptera spp. were observed in the morning. Males are active before sunrise and fly low in the vegetation searching for females. They approach other dragonflies which perch motionless at the roosting sites and show no refusal displays. Males grasp them and form tandems, but there were no heterospecific copulations. With increasing morning temperature the other Anisoptera spp. became active and the tandems separated. Towards the end of the breeding season of S. depressiusculum the proportion of the other spp, of Anisoptera in the roosting community and the number of helerospecific tandem formations increased.

N2  - At her home in Bilthoven, after a long, treacherous illness, which she was hearing with much courage and which to the very last did not break her good spirits, our Janny peacefully drifted away from this world on 28 March 1993, at 13.30 h. In the middle of greeting cards and small dragonfly presents, sent by over 150 worried SIO members, she departed from us — her warm heart will he unable to watch any longer over her odonatological ’’family”. Her home, known to dozens-upon-dozens of odonatologists as the ’’Dragonfly Lodge”, had to close its doors. Dr JANNY MARGARETHA VAN BRINK, Emeritus Professor of Cytogenetics of the University of Utrecht, The Netherlands {horn: 5 May 1923, Rotterdam), was the principal initiator, the cornerstone and a true Mother of the SIO. Her outstanding management capacities, capable financial administration and, above all, her warm and always understanding heart brought together and for more than 20 years now kept together the world odonatological community in a way unique in the history of Entomology. In the odonatologists’ world, the SIO will remain a lasting monument of, and stand a witness to her rich life. In the dragonfly kingdom, Microgomphus jannyae Legrand, 1992, Epigomphus jannyae Belle, 1993 and Coenagrion vanbrinki Lohmann, 1993 will for ever preserve her name.

Development was thought to be completely semivoltine at this location, although the possibility of univoltine development is discussed. The proportion of the senior cohort overwintering in the penultimate (F-l) instar varied from zero to approximately 35% in the three cohorts studied. Emergence was synchronised but was interrupted by adverse weather conditions. In the year when F-1 larvae constituted a large proportion of the overwintering senior cohort, their emergence was signified by a small second peak in numbers. The larval sex ratio and the sex ratio at emergence did not differ significantly from unity. Mortality at emergence ranged from 3% to 5% and was mainly due to incomplete eedysis, failure to expand the wings and predation by spiders. The reasons for the low emergence mortality in this population are discussed.

N2  - Thoracic temperatures (Tlh) were monitored while the insects were perching. Mean T,h was about 28°C in both sexes perching in sunflecks. T,h was positively correlated with ambient temperature (TA) in both sexes. The radiant heat load, which was termed the radiation temperature (TR), in sunflecks ranged from 27°C to 50°C. TIh was regulated against TR. After capture 1 live and 1 dead 6 were taped with spread wings onto brown paper. The pair was put in a sunlit point of a sunfleck to measure T,h. Tlh of perpendicular males, to direct sunlight, was kept lower than TR under a high radiation temperature of more than 35°C. Tth of live males was usually kept higher than that of dead ones. The role of perching in sunflecks is discussed with regard to thermoregulation in this sp.

N2  - The larvae of 19 spp. were collected along an extreme environmental gradient from 50-2560 m altitude in central Nepal’s Gandaki River from 1984 to 1986. The number of spp. declined with increasing elevation; 12 spp. were captured in the subtropical lowlands, 10 in the mid-altitude hills, 4 in the Himalaya Mountain zone, and 3 in the high altitude trans-Himalaya ecoregion. The gomphids Davidius sp. and Anisogomphus occipitalis were most common, comprising 67% of 995 specimens, and had the widest range, occurring from 100-1189 m. The zygopteran Megalestes major and 2 anisopterans Neallogaster hermionae and Sympetrum commixtum, were collected at highest altitude; these spp. occurred in no other samples. Cluster analysis of species composition shows similarity among other high altitude collections, as well as among lowland sites, but low similarity between high and low altitude locations.

The tannery effluent was found to shorten the time taken for the first moult in captivity, whereas the paper and pulp mill effluent arrested moulting in the larvae. It is inferred that the effluents from the tannery and the paper and pulp mill could have a juvenomimctic (mimic of juvenile hormone) effect on the dragonfly larvae, inhibiting moulting and growth.

N2  - The flight of E. superstes was filmed in Japan with a high-speed camera, at up to 500 frames/s. The wingbeat frequency of flying individuals is 40-52 Hz. Always with the fore- and hindwings counterstroking, they can both hover and move in all directions and the forward flight is very rapid (up to 9 m.s1 measured). The flight parameters and the orientation of the long axis of the body with respect to flight direction and stroke direction were compared with those of Zygoptera and Anisoptera. E. superstes was found to be intermediate between the 2 suborders. With regard to maximal flight speed and flight manoeuvrability it is clearly inferior to modem Anisoptera. The observed direction of the wing stroke relative to the flight path raises aerodynamic questions. These are discussed along with other aspects of flight technique, functional morphology, ecology and phylogeny that bear on the occurrence of E. superstes as a relict sp.

N2  - Differences in behaviour between ultimate and penultimate instar larvae of I. posita were examined using caudal lamella loss as an assay. Equal densities of each instar were separately assembled in 20 L aquaria using 39 vertical dowels as an artificial weed bed. After 24 h there were 5 deaths in the ultimate instar assemblages and 1 death in the penultimate assemblages. One hundred sixty one ultimate instar larvae (72%) suffered some loss of lamellae while only 54 penultimate larvae (24%) were so affected (PcO.OOl). Comparison of number of lamellae lost yielded similar results: 254 lost among ultimates, 65 among penultimates (PcO.OOl). The hypothesis that lamella loss follows a binomial distribution could not be rejected. This pattern suggests that lamellae are lost singly and that no individual has a higher probability of loss than another. Video recorded trials of paired, same instar larvae suggest that differences in lamellae loss result from differential use of agonistic behaviour patterns rather than differences in encounter rates due to locomotion patterns.

N2  - Quasi-steady assumptions can be used to model animal aerodynamics. It has been known for over two decades that this approach fails to explain all the lift generated during dragonfly flight. Hovering is a specific area of dragonfly flight which is least applicable to the steady state analysis. Proposed unsteady effects which start to explain novel lift generating mechanisms are outlined.

It closely resembles the larva of W. lintneri, the only other member of the genus, but can be distinguished from it by the shorter length of the lateral spines on abdominal segment 9; these spines are about 1/5 the length of the segment including the spine, but 1/4 the length or longer in lintneri. W. fletcheri shares with W. lintneri the combined presence of dorsal hooks on abdominal segments 3 through 9 and lateral spines on segment 9 only, characters that are unique among North American corduliid genera. The larval habitat is described and observations of adult behavior and species associations are reported.

N2  - It is confirmed that the reproductive barreer between Calopteryx xanthostoma and the C.-”splendens r”-complex N of it is not imperious. Considerable gene flow occurs between both groups. However, the dine is not symmetrical: S of the contact zone. C. xanthostoma is homogeneous, whereas N of it, a genetic gradient, expressed in continuous variation of the apical extent of the 6 wingspot, extends over many hundreds of km. The possible existence of a third genetic component, of eastern origin, cannot be ruled out. Also, it is presently impossible to decide in which direction introgression proceeds. While the Adour R. basin is inhabited by xanthostoma only, some pure xanthostoma populations on the southern tributaries of the Garonne basin are as probable to be pioneers as relicts. — Interbasin crossings, the very base of gene flow, proceed primarily via source areas of higher order tributaries, not via watershed crossings in lowland areas. The Calopteryx populations of different tributaries to a same major river may, therefore, be more different among themselves than populations of adjacent high-order streams belonging to different drainage basins.

N2  - From the Early Holocene pluvial period until the middle of the 19th century, the El Kala lakes and wetlands had conserved an assemblage of at least 8 afrotropical libellulid spp. Today, 1 of these is lost. 2 of the others have very small extant relict populations, of which that of U. edwardsi represents the type population of its sp. Both are under severe risk of extinction, and steps should be taken to safeguard their breeding sites. — Some morphological data on the type population of U. edwardsi are given. Its hindwing spot is larger and less variable than in the continuous range of the sp. S of the Sahara, and contrasts with that of U. e. hulae Dumont from the Jordan R. valley, where this spot is strongly reduced.

N2  - Larvae of P. bellei are very similar morphologically to the other eastern U.S. Progomphus spp., alachuensis Byers and obscurus (Ramb.). Lateral spines are present on abdominal segments 5-9, dorsal hooks are present on segments 1-9, and lateral brown markings are present on the abdomen. P. bellei larvae are distinct in having a longer dorsal hook on the ninth abdominal segment (0.45-0.60 mm vs. 0.17-0.40 mm in alachuensis and ohscurus), and longer cerci (1.10-1.37 mm vs. 0.80-1.10 in alachuensis and ohscurus). Also, the fourth antennal segment of bellei is about 1/3 the length of the third segment (0.31-0.36), whereas this ratio is greater in ohscurus (0.37- -0.47).

N2  - Sympatric populations of i C. semiopaca, C. notoxantha and C. obscura were studied along a forest creek at El Rodeo Biological Reserve in Costa Rica. Territorial and reproductive behaviour of these 3 spp. are described and compared with C. marina. the only other Cora sp. studied to date. Males defended territories centered around rotting wood in the creek bed, used by females for oviposition. Territories of C. semiopaca. C. notoxaniha and C. ohscura were interspersed along the creek and were occupied simultaneously during the day. Extensive spatial and temporal overlap of resource use by the 3 spp. allowed for considerable interspecific interaction at the study site. Aggressive behaviour of males was similar among the 3 spp., with the exception of an escalated ascending spiral contest, observed only between C. semiopaca males. Reproductive behaviour was not elaborate; males did not perform courtship or postcopulatory site displays to females. Males of all spp. were rarely observed transferring sperm to their accessory genitalia, either while in tandem or while perched alone. The authors were unable to distinguish between females of the 3 Cora spp. at the study site. From records of marked individuals it also appears that semiopaca, notoxantha and obscura males could not distinguish between females of the 3 spp. since a high percentage (32%) of multiple mating females copulated with males of more than one Cora spp. Interspecific mating involved full (unshortened) copulation, often followed by oviposition. Recent sympatry of these 3 spp. is the most plausible explanation for an apparent lack of a premating reproductive isolating mechanism in these species. However, the possibility that these putative species are morphological variants of the same species is suggested.

N2  - 2 models of territoriality were compared in an observational study. The "mutual avoidance" model predicts that males should become more territorial as densities increase. The "resource monopolization” model proposes the opposite. Because some males were territorial throughout the season, even at low densities, the mutual avoidance model was rejected and the resource monopolization was supported. However, another prediction of the resource monopolization model is that if females are easily defended in space, then males benefit by being territorial. This prediction was not met. Mate-encounter points were randomly distributed. Thus it appears difficult for males to monopolize females, and yet some males were territorial throughout the season for reasons that remain to be identified.

N2  - A mark-recapture study in I. denticollis was carried out in a large pond in Mexico, with a high population density. Manly & Parr method was used to measure population size, survivorship and increment rate. There were several daily maxima and minima in population size throughout the study. Minima were attributed to the detrimental effect of strong rains. Survivorship had an average of 0.7053 for both sexes, which converted to days gave 2.86, one of the lowest rates in the Odonata. Maximum longevity was 42 days for males as well as for androchromatic and heterochromatic females. As in other studies males had more constant recapture indices, followed by androchromatic and heterochromatic females. Primary sources of observed mortality were spider predation and falls into the water. The Morisita and variance-to-mean indices suggest an aggregated dispersion pattern for both sexes. Vagility appears to be low. Sex ratios were approximately equal. Maturation time, measured from emergence, was 6-9 days for males and androchromatic females. Comparisons are made with other Ischnura spp., but especially with the closely allied I. gemina.

N2  - Freshly emerged females were marked individually and put into an outdoor cage. By following the individual change of weight and width of abdomen it could be shown that the time of colour change is connected with maturation. The tested females were divided into 2 groups with different food supplies. The transformation of colour took less time in well-fed individuals than in less well-fed ones. In both groups the time for colour transformation was negatively correlated with the date of emergence and the sum of the daily maximum temperatures during the first six days of life.

N2  - Tandems aggregate during oviposition. Discrimination experiments show that a motionless S, fixed to a floating leaf of Potamogeton natans in the typical vertical position of a tandem c?, attracts conspeciftc pairs to land and oviposit at the same site. Successful oviposition occurs only within distinct plant parts, in the case of P. natans almost exclusively into leaf base and petiole, where tandems most frequently land. In the choice of oviposition site, sparkling reflections from the uneven water surface, caused by the edges of water plants, seem to play an important role. On P. natans petioles actual oviposition lasts on average 9.9 min, with a mean egg deposition rate of 5.56 eggs/min. During short stays of less than one minute no actual oviposition normally takes place.

N2  - Longevity in the laboratory was measured for 1071 individuals of Ischnura graellsii, 75 of I. pumilio, 127 of Coenagrion scitulum and 41 of Enallagma cyathigerum. Individuals were maintained in 5 insectaries (50x50x50 cm) with numerous perching substrates, and adults of Drosophila were added as food. Results indicate that males do not live as long as females, in all spp„ although the difference was not significant for C. scitulum. Most I. graellsii adults were obtained from the offspring of 33 laboratory crosses. In this sp. a 2-way ANOVA indicated significant effects of both family and sex on longevity, and family-sex interaction occurred in the F,. It is suggested that this sex difference in longevity is mainly due to the contrasting behaviour of the 2 sexes; males spent much time in prolonged flights looking for females, and great harassment occurred between them. This activity is likely to reduce the longevity. The longevity of 3 9 phenotypes of I. graellsii was similar. Although in all spp. mortality was rather age-independent, a maximum was recorded in the age-class of 4-5 days. This could be due to the failure of some individuals to capture the Drosophila, and could explain the low recapture rate of leneral individuals in the field. Marking had no effect on mortality. This suggests that the low recapture rate, observed in many field studies the day after marking, is probably due to greater dispersal rather than to mortality. The sequence of emergence of both sexes was random in all spp., and so was the sequence of female phenotypes in I. graellsii families. Mortality and deformation during emergence affected ca 11-13% of adults. The importance of insectaries for the study of adult damsclflics is discussed.

N2  - The occurrence and function of wingclapping have been examined in the field and in the laboratory in Calopteryx splendens, C. xanthostoma, C. virgo and C. haemorrhoidalis. Wingclapping, which occurs commonly after flight, involves a slow wing depression by up to 160° (mean duration 735 ms; maximum, 1300 ms), followed by a rapid elevation (mean duration 157 ms; maximum, 200 ms), with a mean ratio of 4.68:1.0. In the field, wingclaps were observed after 33.6% of all flights in C. splendens. at 24-25“C (ambient shade temperature), 5 times more commonly in males than in females; they occurred after 32% of all flights in C. xanthostoma at 30°C and after 80% of all flights in C. haemorrhoidalis at 30°C, with a similar proportion in each sex. – In the laboratory at 30"C wingclapping commonly followed tethered flights, and sometimes also walking and grooming. The number of wingclaps was not correlated with the duration of the preceding flight either in the field or in the laboratory. Spontaneous claps (i.e. those not following other activity) became commoner at 33- 34°C, and also in hypoxic atmospheres. Additionally teneral adults, experiencing oxygen shortage, commonly made 3 types of movement not seen in more mature adults, but resembling larval respiratory responses. These were side-to-side shaking movements (often accompanied by a single wingelap), sustained wing opening by 20- 40° and periodic body raising (’press-ups’). — Measurements have shown that in C. splendens up to 1.4 pi air stroke-1 is displaced from the thorax by forced wing movements, indicating that about 14 pi g-l stroke I could be autoventilated during flight, a figure comparable to T. WEIS-FOGH’s (1967, J. exp. Biol. 47; 561-587) values for aeshnids. It is concluded that wingclapping may serve both respiratory and thermoregulatory functions, the latter by circulating air internally and externally. Wingclapping may be necessary in calopterygids because of their relatively large size and inefficient abdominal ventilatory pump.

N2  - The larvae of Panlala flavescens completed egg and larval development in less than 51 days in fish farm ponds, at a latitude 2“ South of its previously known distributional range in southern Australia. The development rate was less than recorded in earlier studies. Larvae of a second generation were collected from the ponds until May, and were absent until the following February. This evidence indicates that the larvae can complete a life cycle, but their progeny do not overwinter, and that the new population each year is probably derived from migratory adults.

N2  - The new sp. (holotype S: Diamantino, state of Mato Grosso, IV-1988; deposited in the author’s collection) is described and illustrated. It shares with A. furcatus the presence of a pair of long spines on the rear of the occiput but differs from it by the color pattern, shape of the vulvar lamina and mainly by a pair of hook-like prominences on the superior margin of the occipital foramen.

N2  - Variation in attraction of male E. ebrium to models of 2 2 colour morphs was studied at a site in Ontario, Canada, where 85-97% of females were green: the other females were blue, i.e. coloured like males. Mate-searching males were equally attracted to 2 morphs in one experiment, contrary to studies on other Zygoptera. However, more mate-searching males failed to respond positively to the <J-like morph when females were pinned near ’control' males; such failures appear to be errors in recognition of d-like females. Time of day (an index of intensity of mate-searching by males of this sp.) did not account for variation in the number of males that failed to respond positively to females of either morph. Moreover, males that were quite ’interactive’ with other model males were not more likely (than less interactive males) to form tandem sooner with females of either morph. Thus, it was not possible to identify factors that could explain variation in differential male attraction to morphs. The possibility that female colour is a selectively neutral trait cannot be discounted.

N2  - The gut contents of the 2 spp. were examined at a riverine site near Oxford, U.K., during June and July 1991. Individuals were captured in the field and dissected in the laboratory. The mass of gut contents was found to be a useful measure of feeding activity for the spp. concerned. Daily food intake was highly variable within the populations. A full gut could represent a considerable addition to the fresh body weight. Most feeding occurred from 10.00-16.00 h (BST). Differences between sexes were generally small in comparison with the total variation in feeding activity. Tcnerals fed less than non-tenerals in both spp. In 9 C. splendens feeding activity increased until reproductively mature. Gut content analyses should prove useful for studying many aspects of feeding behaviour in a wide range of spp.

N2  - Adult males alighted on the open water surface midstream in a shallow river in the Cape Province, South Africa. They remained on the water surface for up to a few min, sailing against the current upstream in the wind. The behaviour apparently was associated neither with mating nor feeding. The open water surface appears to be a relatively safe place to rest when mid-stream perches arc in short supply. Such a resting spot is away from predators of the marginal vegetation, such as frogs and large Odonata. There is possibly relatively low risk from birds. Predation from fish is also unlikely. It is tentatively concluded that the water surface is a thin layer of relatively enemy-free space where risks from predation are less than at other microsites.

N2  - The reproductive behaviour of this neotropical dragonfly was studied at a farm pond in southern Brazil. The males are present at the oviposition site for ca 9 hrs daily, the maximum density being reached at midday. They arc conspicuously territorial and behave as 'perchers'. Body posture and wing position of perching males vary greatly. Distinct positions of the black and red coloured wings may serve a thermoregulatory and visual function with respect to territorial behaviour. Females appear at water only at noon. Copulation lasts 3-7 s and oviposition takes place at hidden sites between emergent foliage of water plants. Oviposition is attended by the male (non-contact guarding) and multiple mating (up to 6 x consecutively) frequently occurs.

Fixing one vulgalum-like female as the lectotype, the name decoloratum denotes a vulgatum ssp. and is the senior synonym of S. v. flavum Bartenef, 1915. — The valid name of the taxon which was erroneously deemed to be S. decoloratum, is S. sinaiticum Dumont, 1977. Its nominate ssp. is confined to N Africa. S. s. tarraconensis ssp.n. is described from the Iberian Peninsula (holotypc 6, allotype 2 : Rio Canaleta nr Bot, Tarragona prov., Catalonia, Spain, 29-IX-1992).

N2  - Eggshells are studied using light, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. The nomenclature of the eggshell layers is revised. The vitelline envelope (vitelline membrane) is the innermost layer. Its thickness is dependent on the length of the egg stage, and it is believed to play the dominant protective role in the eggshell. The endochorion is thin and multilayered. The exochorion is filamentous and synonymous with the jelly-layer. The jelly has two main functions, one is to camouflage the egg, the other is to enhance the protection provided by the vitelline envelope. Non-expanded jelly is dense and found in the overwintering eggs of S. sanguineum. The expansion of the jelly is water-dependent, but the jelly in S. sanguineum is unable to expand, regardless if water is present. Expanded jelly seems to be of about the same thickness in many species, even when the size of their eggs differ. The thin (24 nm) threads in the jelly are of the same size and structure in all three species investigated, and are therefore believed to be a basic structure in odonate egg-jelly. No micropylar atrium or pedicel is present. The micropylar chutes lead the sperm directly into the oocyte, and no sperm-storage chamber exists. No extrachorionic material is present in the eggshells.

N2  - The scaling of body proportions in I. graellsii is analyzed as body mass in dried specimens and linear dimensions are measured from photographic slides. Results indicate that abdomen mass shows positive allometry with body mass in both sexes, and thorax mass also does so in males. Wing area increases with body mass as expected from geometric similarity, but head width shows negative allometry with body length in both sexes. All traits excepting wing area are sexually dimorphic, but no difference was found in body proportions between female phenotypes of this species. Results indicate that larger individuals allocate more energy to reproduction. This is discussed in relation to the constraints imposed by the energetics of flight in larger individuals.

N2  - A unique and quaint method is described. It has been widespread as a traditional boy game until about the 1960s, but it is now becoming rare and on the verge of extinction. – The method uses a silk thread. 60-80 cm long, with a weight tied at each end. Boys throw this tool up into the sky in front of large species, such as e.g. Anotogaster sieboldii or Anas parthenope julius. The dragonfly mistakes the weights for live bugs and swoops to catch them. At this moment it becomes entangled in the silk thread and it is forced by the weights to fall down to the ground. In this way. the dragonflies are captured alive and unhurt. The idea is similar to that of lure-fishing, and takes advantage of the predatory behaviour and habits of aeshnids and cordulegastrids.

N2  - Courtship and post-copulatory resting (PCR) were examined. Courtship is known not to take place before the formation of the tandem pair. This study shows that the amount of time spent in tandem depends on the territorial status of the male involved. Pairs involving a non-territorial male remain in tandem for longer than pairs with a territorial male. This may be because the male must court the female by showing her a suitable oviposition site before she will accept copulation. Such a site is more readily available to a territorial male. In-tandem courtship has thus been demonstrated to take place in this species. Females do not start to oviposit immediately after termination of copulation. The period of time they spend perched before oviposition is variable. G.E. REHFELDT (1989, Odonalologica 18: 365-372) has produced evidence that this is a mechanism by which females avoid the unwanted attentions of other males who wish to mate with her. The present observations do not support this hypothesis, and no correlation between male activity and the PCR duration was found.

N2  - The post-ovarian genital complex (POGC) is ectodermal in origin and confined to the 8th abdominal segment. It consists of a pair of lateral, elliptical spermathecae, a median, spherical bursa copulatrix and a ventral, pouch-like, rectangular muscular vagina, — In the mature female the spermathecae, bursa copulatrix and vagina are lined with a thick cuticular intima. The vagina is externally wrapped in a thick muscle coat formed of four pairs of sternal muscles. The ducts from the spermathecae open anterolaterally into the bursa copulatrix. The latter opens posteriorly into the vagina through a well defined bursa communis. The fertilization pore is a cuticular tunnel formed from a middorsal and two lateral cuticular plates. The common oviduct opens mid-ventrally into the vagina through a spindle-shaped cuticular orifice. – Soon after ecdysis from the penultimate to the last instar larva, a trilobed epithelial structure is formed from a globular mass of epithelial cells present in the middle of the inner surface of the 8th sternum. By the 4th day the bursa copulatrix and vagina are differentiated from the dorsomedian and ventrolateral lobes of the trilobed structure, respectively. The spermathecae bud off from the lateral walls of the bursa copulatrix. The fertilization pore and bursa communis are formed by the 20th day. Prior to the final moult, the post-ovarian genital complex is fully formed but lies in a collapsed state. In the newly emerged adult, the POGC is lined internally with a distinct, thin cuticle and covered externally with a poorly developed muscle coat.

N2  - In field observations and experiments the sequence of occupation of perches by females, occupation duration and changes of perches by individuals at places of feeding were studied. Females defend their perches from conspecific and closely related individuals. Spontaneous locomotor activity is directed towards the apical part of a branch and to higher perch levels. Changes of perch after failure are usually directed to lower perch levels or more basally along the perch. The number of successful attempts is considerably lower after previous failure than during spontaneous attempts. Sitting time increases with high perches. Females occupy distal perches for a longer time than proximal ones. Dragonflies on high perches try to occupy even higher perches more often. Generally on a perch a dragonfly compensates for the slope of a branch by its body posture and indicates perch occupation by wing and/or abdominal displays both after landing on a perch and when other individuals approach. At feeding places a female defends its feeding territory from conspecific individuals of both sexes as well as from individuals of closely related species. In experiments with models has been shown distant sex differentiation by dragonfly females. The behavioural strategy of S. sanguineum females at places of feeding was compared with behaviour of territorial males at the places of pairing.

N2  - The life cycles of the 2 spp. were studied in a productive pond during 5 yr. In both spp. a 2-yr life cycle was most common. Emergence of both spp. was fairly synchronous and peaked mainly in early June, often starting in late May. C. armatum seemed to be slightly earlier than C. hastulatum. Eggs probably hatched in July-Aug. Most larvae first overwintered in rather early instars, and a second and last time in the final instar. However, a small but variable part of the populations (best documented for C. hastulatum) showed a 1-yr life-cycle with the winter spent in large pre-final instars. This unexpectedly rapid development is probably explained by favourable local conditions. In both spp. a low recruitment of larvae in 1987 is explained by severe weather conditions in that year. It is discussed how detailed information about development and cohort splitting can emerge from limited material of this type.

N2  - Males perch on substrates of different heights (rock = 5-15 cm, grass = 30-40 cm and tree = more than 1 m) in reproductive areas. In order to look for the possibility of male exclusion in these places, an analysis was made using male age and size. Older males were more aggressive and dominant in grass. These males had longer wings than younger ones, but no significant differences prevailed in abdominal and total length. This suggests a possible exclusion of younger males by older males.

N2  - With the sudden departure of our colleague, Tony, the International Odonatological Society (S.I.O.) and its mainstream journals, ODONATOLOGICA, NOTULAE ODONATOLOGICAE and ADVANCES IN ODONATOLOGY, lost yet another cornerstone, the world odonatological community lost a friend and a colleague, and the dragonflies one of their most excellent and prolific students. The Editors of this journal lost an intimate friend and associate. Our correspondence and comradship with JOHN ANTHONY (TONY) LINTHORNE WATSON commenced in the remote summer of 1963, when he was working at the Developmental Biology Center at Cleveland, Ohio (United States), soon upon his return from the legendary “Colloquium on the Odonata”, organized by the late Professor B.E. Montgomery at Lafayette, and which, in a way, was a forerunner of the present International Symposia. The comradship developed rapidly into a friendship. Since February 1973 he became increasingly involved in the SIO affairs, and in February 1978 he volunteered to accept the responsibilities of the SIO Liaison Office for Australasia and the Southern Pacific. Since about that time, he was involved in all major SIO operations and activities, whether as a member of various editorial boards, or as a Council member. From the very first meeting of the Odonate Specialist Group (Kyoto, 1980), operating in the framework of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, he was among its most active members. Among his last services to SIO was the recording of Council meeting minutes at the 12th International Symposium of Odonatology (Osaka, 1993), at which meeting he was requested to consider accepting the office of the President of the Society for the 1997-1999 term ... The help with one of the papers, published in the present issue, was the last work he performed for ODONATOLOGICA.

N2  - Odonatologica The morphology of the micropyle and other chorionic features of eggs of Neopetalia is similar to that of Cordulegastridae, although with 8 rather than 6 or 7 atrial (micropylar) openings. Libelluloids have a different micropylar structure, but the present results show that this is more diverse than hitherto suspected. The previously reported morphology ofSynthemistinae(J.W.H. TRUEMAN, 1991, 20:441-452) and of several corduliids and Libellulidae (J.J. BECNEL & S.W. DUNKLE, 1990, Odonatologica 19: 235-241; – TRUEMAN, 1991, ibid.) is here confirmed, but it is shown that Gomphomacromia has a unique micropyle with up to 4 openings. This finding casts doubt on the current understanding of the Gomphomacromiinae and supports the placement of Gomphomacromia at or near the base of the libelluloids.

N2  - Within and between species the copulation of libellulid dragonflies varies in duration (seconds to >1 h), situation (perched or in flight) and in the amount of copulatory movement that occurs (from no visible activity to persistent rocking movements of the base of the male’s abdomen). Three ways in which sperm may be removed from the spermathecae of females are considered. In the first, in species which make long copulations accompanied by bouts of very small but fast rocking movements, sperm may be gradually filtered from the ejaculate by rows of flagellar spines as the flagellum is oscillated back and forth within the duct. In the second, strong but slower copulatory movements occur which may drive the spiny cornua in and out of the spermathecal ducts, filtering sperm as they do so. In the third, in which there are also marked copulatory movements, the grooved cornua lack spines and the male’s own ejaculate, or a diluted fraction of it. may be used to wash out rival sperm. Finally, in a fourth group of species in which copulation is brief and aerial, and the flagella lack spines but possess large terminal hooks, there is probably less sperm removal from the spermathecae.

(Pentaphlebia and Rimanella); these 4 genera share a notable apomorphic character unique among all odonates: the gill tufts of the larvae. On the other hand, Diphlebia, Philoganga and Lestoidea are put together in the Diphlebiidae; they lack the gill tufts and exhibit many other features in common which are not shared with the Amphipterygidae (s. str.).

N2  - Males were subtracted from or added to existing populations of C. puella beside small ponds in field experiments at Woodwalton Fen, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom (1992, 1993). When insects were subtracted the population returned to the original level within IVi h. Addition of insects from elsewhere raised low populations to a certain level, but did not raise populations already at that level. C. paella do not fight, but the pursuit of one male by another can lead to the pursued one leaving the water. Whether or not this is the mechanism controlling male population density by water, clearly the behaviour of the insects is at least partly responsible. The quasi-territorial behaviour in C. paella operates at low as well as high population densities. It enables a higher steady population density to occur than is found in the truly territorial species so far studied. An interesting and unexplained anomaly of population density in C. paella is described.

N2  - The sspp. from France, Spain and Morocco are redescribed on a statistical basis, taking into account their intrinsic variability. C. b. iberica ssp.n. (holotype S: Spain, Albacete prov.. Sierra de Alcaraz, Puerto de las Crucetillas, alt. ca 1450 m, 18-VII-1989; deposited at Lab. Biol. Insectes, Univ. Nancy-I), which falls between C. b. algirica and C. b. immaculifrons, is described from central and eastern southern Spain. All these sspp. occur in pure populations in some areas, but coexist in other regions, apparently giving rise to hybridization and constituting heterogeneous mixed populations over large territories. Such coexistence cannot constitute a criterion against the conspecific status of these taxa, as was claimed for C. b. boltonii and C. b. trinacriae in Italy; therefore all these taxa are treated here as sspp. of C. boltonii throughout. The range of each ssp, and each type of mixed population is defined and mapped. Exuviae were collected in the most homogeneous areas in France and Spain and their distinctive features were redefined on a statistical basis. With regard to exuviae, C. b. iberica stands closer to C. b. algirica than to C. b. immaculifrons, although it has been previously confused with the latter.

N2  - 1300 specimens, representing 30 spp. were caught in northern Germany and southern France and measured. The wing areas were determined with a special-purpose computer and the weight was measured with a precision of ± 1 mg. Several weight classes were found, from an average of 45 mg in some Zygoptera to ca 876 mg in some Aeshnidae. The sample also fell into separate groups with respect to wing loading. Certain Anisoptera have relatively large wing loadings. Implications of the data with respect to ecology, ethology and flight biology of the Odonata are discussed. The changes in weight of Leucorrhinia rubicunda during the flight season were monitored, particular attention was paid to sex differences.

On the base of pruinescence micromorphology, 2 groups of families can be distinguished, viz. Lestidae+Libellulidae, with lamellar pruinosity, and Calopterygidae+Euphaeidae, with filamentous pruinosity. Differences in the microstructure of the pruinescent colouration result from some solid morphological (structure of porous canals of the cuticle) and/or biochemical (structure of cuticular waxes) differences between the odon. groups. The structures are interpreted both as sunlight reflectors and as colour patterns useful in intraspecific communication.

N2  - Sperm displacement was studied during extremely long copulations in this sp., in order to estimate the S ability of sperm removal and insemination. Copulations began early in the morning and continued until late noon, and thereafter females oviposited alone, without 6 -guard. In the field, copulation lasted 395.3 ±11.6 min (s.e., n=12), and stage I, during which sperm in the $ sperm storage organs was removed, occupied almost all of the copulation duration. However, sperm in a bursa copulatrix was mostly removed within 1 h after the initiation of copulation, and the bursal sperm volume remained low for several hours. Sperm volume in the spermatheca, which was almost of equal volume to the bursal sperm in precopula, did not significantly change during copulation. Stage II occupied by insemination into the bursa copulatrix, lasted only about 1 min prior to the termination of copulation. The process of sperm displacement, specially the S ability to displace sperm during the extremely long stage I, is discussed.

N2  - Concentrations and body burdens of copper, cadmium, lead, manganese, zinc, and calcium were measured in the larva and imago. Metal concentrations were greatly affected by size, with the smaller larvae generally having higher concentrations of all metals except copper. Metal body burdens and size, in contrast, were positively correlated. When metal concentrations in different larval size-classes were analyzed, copper levels were not found to exhibit significant changes with increasing weight, while calcium and zinc concentrations levelled off beyond a certain weight. Cadmium, lead, and manganese concentrations, on the other hand, registered steady declines with increasing weight. The body burdens of copper, calcium and zinc increased consistently with increasing weight, while those of cadmium, lead and manganese declined after an initial increase. The concentrations and body burdens of all metals were higher in the final instar larva when compared to those in the adult, except that calcium concentration was higher in the latter. During the final moult, higher proportions of cadmium, lead and manganese were lost along with the exoskeleton than those of copper, calcium and zinc. Thus, the exoskeleton of C. servilia might play an important role in sequestration and eventual elimination of excess metals, particularly the non-essential ones.

N2  - Although natural odonate habitats have decreased recently due to disappearance of ponds from urban areas, it is shown that outdoor swimming pools during the off season become available as a habitat for some spp. Out of 24 swimming pools at primary schools in Kyoto city (Japan) examined during the period from late May to early June, late instar larvae of S. s. imitoides, S. frequens and S. darwinianum were found in 22 (92%), 9(42%) and 2(8%), resp. The life history of S. s. imitoides, the most common of these, was investigated at the swimming pool of one primary school. Larvae were distributed contagiously in detritus settling towards the periphery of the pool, and we estimated the number of last instar larvae in late May as ca 2000. There were numerous chironomid larvae in the pool which the larvae of S. s. imitoides consumed preferentially. Adult emergence was observed from the end of May but was interrupted due to poolcleaning. Mature dragonflies sought out the pool in Oct. and males established territories for 1-18 days. It is concluded, the reason why imitoides larvae are found so commonly at swimming pools is that, their life history pattern of laying eggs in Oct. with adult eclosion the next June coincides with the non-use period of the pools, and females lay eggs directly into the water.

N2  - Small, moving, visual targets commonly excite fast saccadic head movements (head-cocks) in perched dragonflies. Head-cocking in response to natural stimuli has been examined by video-recording perched individuals of 7 libellulid and 1 gomphid species in the field during periods of feeding or sexual activity. Head-cocks varied in duration from 40 to > 1000 ms (mean 350 ms) and they usually occurred many times per minute. Typically a head-cock consisted of 3 components: a fast saccadic movement in the rolling and/or pitching plane; a brief period of stasis or of slow, smooth head movement, often involving a yaw component and interpreted as visual tracking; and finally a fast return to the rest position. A minority of head-cocks was followed by take-off, normally in the direction to which the head had been aimed. In species which kept their forelegs lifted off the ground when perched (e.g. Orthetrum), yawing was sometimes amplified by a turning of the prothorax on the synthorax, and also sometimes by rotations of the whole body on the legs. Head-cocks could be evoked by throwing or swinging stones 10-20 cm in front of a perched dragonfly, but their mean duration was significantly less than that of spontaneous head-cocks. No head-cocking has been seen in perched aeshnids or in the zygopterans examined. Head-cocks are believed to aim the acute zones of the eyes at a target, and they may also allow its distance to be estimated by stereopsis since the axes of some ommatidia in a forward-looking acute zone either side of the irons converge a few cm in front of the insect. Head cocks may also determine the direction of take-off through the action of proprioceptors in the neck.

N2  - The previously undescribed egghell ultrastructure of 5 spp. is discussed in relation to other known eggshells within the order. Whereas the vitelline envelope has the same structure in all species, the endo- and the exochorion are diverse. Endochorionic sublayers are present, being few and uniform in the smaller eggs but numerous and increasing in thickness from the inside in the larger eggs. The exochorion varies from a compact layer via a layer with pores to a fibrous layer acting as a jelly. It is proposed that endophytic eggs as a group are not so homogeneous as previously believed. Eggshell differences are possibly influenced by different egg-laying substrates, i.e. various living and decaying plants.

N2  - In the experiments with female models 2 questions were asked, viz. (1) How do perching males, which are oriented in different directions relative to the bank, respond to the females? (2) What is the flight direction chosen by a male after seizure of the female? The majority of perching males (46.5%) are directed towards the bank. Males facing towards the bank or parallel to it responded to the female model more often with tandem reaction than males facing away from the bank. 52% of males flew towards the bank after seizure of the female model. Thus, males which perch facing the water are most likely to fly towards it when in tandem. Nearly 8% of the males which captured female models (n=82) tried to oviposit with them usually after unsuccessful attempts of the male to mate. The results obtained suggest the leading role played by S. sanguineum males in oviposition behaviour.

N2  - The results of experiments are presented which suggest that males can discriminate between mates and non-mates. In trials with tethered females, males experienced an approximately 15 min ‘refractory period’ between mating once and remating. When given a choice between a recent mate, and a (recently mated) non-mate ovipositing on their territories, males were significantly more likely to mate a non-mate than a previous mate. The possible mechanisms for discrimination are considered.

N2  - New phylogenetic systematic methodologies are presented and the terms ‘neapomorphy’, ‘coapomorphy’, ‘exapomorphy’ and ‘apophyletic’ introduced. Results are presented in sorted character state matrices which show the outcome of character state evaluation while depicting phylogenetic arrangement. Higher classification, phylogeny, and biogeography of Anisoptera are reviewed and keys provided for superfamilies and families. The pattern of anisopteroid neapomorphy supports the superfamily arrangement proposed by F.L. CARLE (1986, Odonatologica 15: 275- -326), while indicating polyphyly for Cordulegasteroidea [sic] of EC. FRASER (1957, A reclassification of the order Odonata, R. Zool. Soc NSW, Sydney) and both “Neanisoptera”and“Petaluroidea”ofH.-K. PFAU (1991, Adv. Odonalol. 5: 109-141). Paraphyletic groupings include Aeschnidae [sic] of R.J. TILLYARD (1917, The biology of dragonflies, Cambridge Univ. Press), and Cordulegastroidea of D. A.L. DAY 1ES (1981, Soc. int. odonatol. rapid Comm. 3: 1-60). Nothomacromia nom.n. is proposed as a replacement for Pseudomacromia Carle & Wighton, 1990, nec. Pseudomacromia Kirby, 1890. Congruence between phylogenetic and biogeographic patterns indicates two or more distinct mesozoic utilizations of a trans-pangaeian montane dispersal route. Incorrect association of Neopetalia with austropetaliids for the past 137 years has obscured the gondwanian origin and subsequent radiation of non-cordulegastrid Libelluloidea, a process which began at least 140 million years ago on the now frozen continent of Antarctica. – Chlorogomphid evolution was largely influenced by unknown vicariant events related to the combined forces of mountain building and rapid drift of India toward the equator, coupled with a 40-60 million year insular isolation. insular isolation. Classification is revised as follows: Chlorogomphidae: Chloropetaliinae subfam.n.: (Chloropetaliini trib. n.): Chloropetalia gen.n. [type C. selysi Fraser]; – Chlorogomphinae comb, n.: (Eorogomphini trib. n.): Eorogomphus gen.n. [type O. preciosus Fraser]; (Sinorogomphini trib. n.); Sinorogomphus gen.n.

N2  - Territorial tactics, aggressive interactions, 3 body characters (wing, abdominal and total length), mating success, and the influence of weather conditions were analysed in territorial males. The number of aggressive encounters was positively affected by male abundance and aggression and by weather conditions, also depending on the time of the day. Male abundance was conditioned by territory rank (taken as an index of territory quality). 3 male territorial tactics were discerned, viz. resident, sneaker and floater. Resident males were the most aggressive individuals, and their territories were disputed by sneaker males. Floater males rarely fought. There were no differences in size among individuals using these tactics. A positive correlation existed only between the abdominal and total lengths and the territory rank, but this was probably largely incidental. No size differences were noticed between copulating and non-copulating males. As in other Calopterygidae, the mating system of H. cruentata is a resource-defence polygyny.

N2  - S and E of the Bay of Iskenderun in Turkey, C. lindenii (Sdl.) changes from the nominal subspecies to spp. zernyi Schmidt in an introgressive manner with the formation of genetic ‘islands’ rather than a stable dine. In populations in E Anatolia, imagos emerging early in the season are close to lindenii (i.e. large and dark), while those emerging later in summer, are zemyi. Thus, a different time of development and eclosion of the larvae restricts the gene flow between the 2 taxa, and slows down retrogression.

N2  - Problems with housing adult damselflies include unnatural responses to being caged and prohibitive costs of outdoor cages. Here, a relatively inexpensive method, using pre-fabricated tents as outdoor inseclaries, is presented. These tents do not adversely affect flying, foraging, mate searching, and mating of damselflies. Survival rates of pre-reproductive adults were also high (100% survival of teneral females for the entire pre-reproductive period in 1 of 2 trials). Outdoor insectaries also have been used successfully for housing other spp., inch E. boreale Sel. and Nehalennia irene (Hag.).

N2  - Adult Odonata species assemblage patterns were studied at 8 ponds near Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Different ponds had different assemblages. Strong inferential evidence from multivariate analysis and correlation suggested that the main determinants of assemblage patterns were certain biotic and abiotic environmental variables. In other words, assembly ‘rules’ may be governed more by factors external to the taxon than by interspecific competition. Larger ponds were not necessarily richer in species than smaller ponds because factors such as water quality, vegetation type and microsite diversity overrode biotope size. Species richness was greatest at shallow, well-vegetated ponds with clear, oxygenated water. Such ponds provide suitable conditions for both larvae and adults. Sunlight/shade and marginal/submerged vegetation gradients were the main drivers of assembly patterns at the ponds. Species assemblage patterns were determined by several variables acting together. In turn, the assemblage patterns at each pond were influenced by different variables representing different ecological successional stages.

N2  - A data matrix comprising 96 selected wing venation characters from each of 15 fossil and 32 extant spp. was analysed using cladistic parsimony algorithms. The results indicate that suborder Anisoptera is a natural (i.e. monophylelic) grouping, but that both Anisozygoptera and Zygoptera are paraphyletic. Within the extant order, coenagrionoid and lestoid families occupy the basal branches of the phylogenetic tree. Next comes Calopterygoidea as a monophyletic group, then Amphipterygidae, then Anisozygoptera, and finally Anisoptera as a monophyletic group. The Australian endemic species Hemiphlebia mirabilis Selys is indicated as sister to a clade comprising the whole remainder of the modem order, plus the Permian suborders Protozygoptera and Archizygoptera and the Triassic suborder Triadophlebiomorpha. If this phylogenetic estimate is correct, the conservation value of H. mirabilis is far greater than its current taxonomic status as a monotypic superfamily would suggest.

N2  - The data from S. danae (cf. N.K. MICHIELS, 1992, Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. 29: 429-435) showed that the last male’s fertilization precedence, P,, changes irregularly with time between copulation and oviposition, but no systematic trend was found at that time. These data were now re-analyzed with a more appropriate statistical tool (GLIM), and it was found that P increases with time between copulation and oviposition. This suggests that the first male’s sperm initially has a positional advantage to fertilize the eggs. This advantage decreases, probably due to slow sperm mixing, and the precedence of the second male increases. This is the first odon. sp. for which the second male’s sperm is shown to have a positional advantage.

Orange and blue females were dissected and all blue forms contained mature eggs, but no orange females held eggs. Blue females averaged 28.3 mg, while orange individuals averaged 20.8 mg. It is concluded that there is no evidence that this sp. has dichromatic females.

N2  - Territorial and courtship displays and their relation to male ornamentation were examined in 11 spp. in N Borneo. Males of all spp. were territorial, guarding a small area of oviposition substrate and attempting to mate with ovipositing females. Most spp. exhibited a ritualized threat display, in which males faced each other and displayed the terminal markings on their wings. In the genus Libellago there was a pronounced stationary wing display, in which the outstretched forewings were held completely still for about a second. This behaviour did not occur in L. hyalina which lacks markings on its wings. Apart from L hyalina, some form of courtship occurred in all spp. for which information was available, typically involving the male swinging to and fro in a semicircle to the side of the female, while displaying and vibrating his pruinescent legs. Variations included display of various markings on wings and abdomen, probably associated with species recognition, and in Rhinocypha aurofulgens, standing on the substrate during courtship, a modification probably associated with loss of pruinescence on the legs in this spp. Interspecific interactions were frequently intense, and probably have been important in the evolution of displays. An outline of possible evolutionary relationships among display elements is suggested.

N2  - Adult male Odon. spp. and related environmental variables were recorded around a farm dam in South Africa. Although the species-environment correlation was low at the microhabitat level, it was stronger at the larger spatial scale of biotope. Microhabitats were classified on the basis of species that preferred sunlit or shaded conditions. This confirms results from earlier studies on adult dragonfly assemblages at both still and running waters. Thermoregulatory requirements of species were important in determining the presence of adults in microhabitats. Microhabitat overlap between congenerics was low, suggesting the influence of past competition. Some spp. had much narrower Eltonian niches than others, and similarly there were various degrees of tolerance to changes in conditions. The stenotopic spp., being sensitive to certain conditions were therefore better indicators of changing microhabitat or biotope conditions. The implications of these findings for conservation are discussed, and it is suggested that a wide range of plant physiognomy and hence also wide differences in thermal conditions are created to cater for a variety of rare, stenotopic spp., as well as abundant, eurytopic ones.

N2  - The original description is revised. Both sexes are best characterized by the presence of a peculiar leaf-like structure on the hind ridge of the laminae mesostigmales. A recent record of 2 ? from lake Balkhash, presumably based on a defective figure in the original description, is rejected. The sp. is only remotely allied to other regional Ischnura, and might be a Pliocene relict.

N2  - Tandem oviposition (contact guarding) in low-density populations was observed at a small pond in New York State. Oviposition generally occurred between 1200-1430, during which time pairs appeared at the water already in tandem. Searches of the surroundings failed to reveal aggregations of tandem pairs; hence pairs may have flown immediately to the water or may have come from greater distances. Many arriving tandems performed dipping movements over potential oviposition sites along the shoreline. This behaviour resembled oviposition, was often followed by copulation, and may have functioned to show the 9 oviposition sites and thereby induce mating. During tandem oviposition, the c? alternately dipped the 9’s abdomen into the water and struck it against the pond bank or other surface; such actions probably deposited eggs both in the water and on mud or shore vegetation. As many as 10 pairs occasionally oviposited 5-10 cm from one another at the same site. Occasional lone 6 6 were present near oviposition areas, but rarely disrupted tandem pairs; no takeovers or rematings of ovipositing 9 9 were recorded. Guarders stayed in tandem for the duration of oviposition and never switched to non-contact guarding. The adaptive significance of contact guarding in S. vicinum is discussed with reference to other members of the genus.

N2  - The procedures used to obtain laboratory mating and oviposition of /. elegans, involving both individuals raised from larvae in captivity and others captured from the wild as imagines, are reported. Egg-clutches laid by 25 2 of known mating histories and 26 2 caught from the wild as adults are described. Observations relating to survival in captivity, intra-specific predation, age at first copulation, copulation duration, oviposition and 2 inter-copulation interval are reported and discussed. Mean copulation duration was greater for non-virgin 2 2 than for virgins (average durations 104 and 78 min, resp.). The number of days a 2 survived after her first copulation was the best predictor of her life-time egg production. This fecundity was not affected by the number of times a 2 copulated. 2 2 were seen to repel many mating attempts, Of 33 2 which mated in captivity, 15 mated more than once, with more than half of these rematings occurring within 4 days of the previous copulation, after fertile eggs had been laid. This demonstrates that at least some 2 2 are willing to remate soon after successful sperm transfer by a previous S, apparently contradicting a previous description of this sp. as monogamous in England.

N2  - It is shown that maturing A. mixta can use shivering as a pre-flight warming up strategy, which gives the insects the capacity to switch between pure ectothermy and a combination of ectothermy and endothermy. So far this has been evidenced in mature odonates only. Since this strategy opens the way to eocrepuscular flight in immatures, this may be a cue in explaining the role of twilight zone flight. For the first time the relationship between ambient temperature (T_) and shivering on the duration of the pre-flight period was investigated under natural conditions. The duration of shivering was negatively, but just not significantly, correlated with the ambient temperature. The duration of shivering and T_ did not effect the duration of the pre-flight period. Shivering intensity, however, significantly reduced the time prior to take-off. The observations suggest that abdominal shivering may represent part of an endothermic strategy.

The new Categories provide a highly workable framework for threat assessment, especially so with respect to changes in status, and stimulate discussion on whether certain spp. should be removed from the list, yet other spp. added. They also stimulate worthwhile research in single-species conservation albeit at a fairly high financial cost.

N2  - This is the southernmost member of the genus. The description is based on the reared Argentine material from Buenos Aires. Unlike in T. australis (Hag ), the only congener of which the immature stage has been described, in T. risi there are dorsal hooks on segments 4-8 only. This requires a slight modification of the generic key provided by J.G. NEEDHAM & M.J. WESTFALL, 1955, Dragonflies of North America, Univ. California Press. A modified key is appended.

N2  - The diet spectra of 8 spp„ belonging to several systematic and ecological groups, were analyzed by a serological method. It is demonstrated that the zygopterans possess rather uniform diets, consisting predominantly of chironomids. In contrast, the anisopterans have a more heterogeneous diet, which changes during the season; they forage on chironomids, mosquitoes, butterflies and horseflies, as well as on representatives of their own order. The food preferences of these odonates are connected with the peculiarities of the behaviour of the prey rather than its size. Thus, under conditions in West Siberia, they have a maximal effect on population sizes of chironomids and representatives of their own order.

N2  - Recent evidence suggests that fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of characters may index either stress during development of organisms, or be related to fitness of individuals following development. The Authors tested whether wing FA of C. resolutum was related to damselfly age and to male pairing success. It was predicted that younger individuals should have higher FA on average as compared to older individuals if FA was related to damselfly survival. It was found that younger individuals had higher FA than older individuals over all sampling dates combined. However, this relation was due to the inclusion of one of three comparisons between pre-reproductive and mature insects, and was not a general phenomenon. Wing FA was not related to male pairing success. The results suggest that character FA can be related to fitness measures of damselflies, but not in a highly repeatable way. Data are also provided on seasonal changes in mite parasitism and body size that may relate to our finding FA-fitness relations restricted to one period of the flight season.

N2  - In its northern and western range the sp. is known only from a few islands. It occurs in S England and E Wales, the Isle of Wight and the Polish island Wolin. Records prior to 1913 are available from Sjtelland and Vendsyssel. From 5 further islands only single and doubtful records are known which, apart from Bornholm, are all more than a century old; viz. Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and Crete. The sp. has not been recorded from any other island in the Baltic, the North Sea, the English Channel, the Atlantic Ocean, or in the western Mediterranean. In SE Europe it inhabits numerous islands in the Ionian and Aegean Seas. – Four different hypotheses for the absence of P. pennipes on the islands in its northern and western range are discussed.

N2  - Parameters for shape, mass and virtual mass are described for the wings and bodies of 7 spp. The distribution of wing area and virtual mass follow precise allometric relationships, and these parameters can be predicted from the position of the centroid of area for each wing. Wing mass distributions show less clear trends due to specific effects of the pterostigmas. The different wing shapes between Anisoptera and Zygoptera are related to differences in their flight behaviours. No difference in wing shape was found between ‘flier’ and ‘percher’ groups of dragonfly. A clear relationship exists between the radii of the centre of mass and the second radius of gyration for the odon. bodies. The position of the centre of mass relative to the wing bases is related to the flight style and manoeuvrability of these insects.

N2  - There are more studies of mating or reproductive success of dragonflies than of any other insects; their size and ability to be marked and watched renders them particularly suitable for such studies. – Laboratory studies on feeding and development rates of larvae indicate that well-fed larvae moult into larger animals and do so sooner than poorly fed individuals. – This trend is reflected in a decline in size at emergence through the season and in those adults arriving at a particular rendezvous to breed. – For many early emerging species the best weather for reproductive activity is at the end of their flying period, a time likely to be encountered by smaller adults. Weather is known to have a major influence on lifetime reproductive success of dragonflies. – It seems that the “best” larvae, those that emerge first, suffer reduced reproductive activity because later emergers experience better weather and consequently obtain more matings. – The present paper explores this apparent paradox and attempts to resolve it.

Some ecological factors enabling the species to expand northward were considered, based on observations which have been made in and near Kobe since its first discovery in 1987. This expansion started from southern Kochi about 50 years ago and the yearly mean air temperature has risen by about 1.0 to 1.7°C during the last 95 years in this region. The rise of air temperature coincides with both the temporal and spatial expansions.

N2  - Two forms of M. nawai males occur in the study area, viz. the orange wing (f. nawai) and the pale orange wing (f. sahoi). The nawai males defend a territory and copulate with females that appear in their territory, while sahoi males are non-territorial and sneak matings with females that are ovipositing in a territory. Observations of aggressive behaviour among the males suggest that the non-territorial sahoi relinguish in fights with the territorial nawai, perhaps because they adopt other alternative mating tactics (e.g. sneaking). The frequencies of copulations observed for nawai and sahoi were 35 and 12, respectively. The ratio of these frequencies to population size of each of the 2 motphs was not significant. Therefore, the reproductive success of sahoi males is influenced by the female oviposition condition. The pre- and post-copulatory mating tactics of both nawai and sahoi males are discussed.

N2  - Male calopterygid damselflies commonly demonstrate 2 alternative mate-securing tactics, occurring as either territorial or non-territorial individuals. Previous studies have assumed that non-territorial males constitute one category. This study describes variation in non-territorial behaviour which is dependent upon whether or not the non-territorial male had been displaced from a territory. Consequently, non-territorial males are classified as pre-territorial or post-territorial. Pre-territorial males are agonistic towards conspecific territorial males and fight to obtain territories. Post-territorial males rarely fight; instead they wait for territories to become vacant.

N2  - Although hyaline-winged males of M. p. costalis adopt sneak tactics, the competition for occupying a perching site to intercept females entering the territory is severe. To help understand the tactic of the hyaline-winged males, their size, copulation behaviour and reproductive success were examined. The mate-securing tactics of the hyaline-winged males were divided into two. A male which succeeded in occupying a perching site was named a ‘satellite’, while a male which failed was called a ‘wanderer’ . The satellite was usually larger than the wanderer. The satellites were able to copulate with females inside the territory of an orange-winged male. The diurnal rhythm of copulations was similar for each tactic. Copulation duration was longest in wanderers outside a territory. When the duration of oviposition is used as an index of reproductive success of a male, the satellite tactic may be more advantageous than the opportunistic tactic of wanderers. However, from the viewpoint of sperm displacement, the longest copulation duration suggested complete sperm displacement by wanderers. In contrast, the relatively short copulation duration in territorial orange-winged males suggests that not all the sperm of wanderers is removed. Both the occupation of a perching site and the long copulation duration are important for the hyaline-winged males to increase their reproductive success.

N2  - A list of dragonflies known from the Philippines is presented with data on their distribution by the accuracy of the islands. In addition to the 224 named spp. (and 3 sspp.), some 65-70 still undescribed or unidentified (to species level) taxa are listed. Detailed collecting data are presented for 14 named spp., which arc listed from the Philippines for the first time, viz. Archibasis viola, Acrogomphus jubilaris, Ceriagrion cerinorubellum, Ictinogomphus decoratus melaenops, G. dohrni, Gynacantha arsinoe, Heliaeschna simplicia, H. uninervulata, Tetracanthagyna brunnea, Indaeschna grubaueri, Macromia westwoodi, Aethriamanta gracilis, Neurothemis fluctuans and Rhyothemis obsolescens. Prodasineura obsoleta (Selys, 1882) is synonymized with P. integra (Selys, 1882) and Gomphidia platerosi Asahina, 1980 with G. kirschii Selys, 1878. A few other possible synonymies are suggested for future confirmation. A brief review of the earlier studies on Philippine Odonata is presented. Grouped according to the present understanding of the Philippine biogeographical regions, all major islands are briefly characterized and separate lists are given for 40 islands. The records are based on literature data, and on ca 27 000 specimens in Roland Muller’s collection, ca 2 000 specimens in coll. Ris at SMF and on some other smaller collections studied by the authors.

N2  - C. splendens is common along slow-flowing streams and rivers in central Europe. This sp. is well-suited for studies on the population structure and mobility of semi-aquatic rheobiont organisms. In this study the authors investigated a local population over a 2 km stretch of river in central Germany, by habitat analysis and mark-recapture-experiments. Emergent aquatic vegetation only influences density if the coverage is lower than 10%. Adult damselflies mainly use vegetation along the banks. Unused, moderately eutrophicated stands of herbaceous vegetation without trees and shrubs are preferred. Insolation in the morning is the primary factor for the selection of males' territories and thus determines the pattern of density. The investigated population turns out to be much bigger than expected. 2649 individuals have been marked individually (1543 6, 1106 9). 47% of the 66 and 29% of the 9 9 have been recaptured at least once. Most individuals migrated less than 300 m, which is roughly the home range size, but 23 individuals covered more than 1000 m. Three bridges spanned the investigated stretch of river. None of them caused a complete fragmentation of the habitat, but in the case of a wide but low bridge, more than 70% of the approaching damselflies turned back. However, 13% of all recaptured individuals successfully crossed at least one bridge.

C. hastulatum is classified as a summer species. The date of emergence was negatively correlated with head width in 9 2 but not in <J cj. In tJ <? , a negative correlation occurred between the date of emergence and the body mass at emergence. These findings are contrasting previous studies and are discussed with respect to sexual differences. The results are compared with the emergence patterns of other odonates.

N2  - It is situated in the mid-ventral region of the 8th abd. sternum, and is composed of a mid-anterior large bursa copulatrix, a mid-posterior tubular vagina and a pair of lateral elliptical spermathecae. These components are covered externally by the sternal and intrinsic muscles. A cuticular plate is embedded in the anterior region of the vagina and is connected to the seventh sternum by a pair of muscle bands. The spermathecae open into a bursa copulatrix through short spermathecal ducts anterodorsally. The bursa copulatrix contains a net-work of cuticular canals, and opens into the vagina through a distinct bursa communis. The spermatozoa dissociate from the spermiozeugma (Spermatodesms) and seminal fluid within the bursa copulatrix. The cuticular intima of the spermathecae is thin and lightly corrugated while that of the bursa copulatrix is thick and heavily folded. The cuticular intima of the lateral region of the vagina is thin but covered with overlapping dented scales. A pair of accessory sex glands are present in the 9th segment and open into the vagina. This is thought to be the first report of such glands in an anisopteran. – The eggs are elongate and cylindrical, with a complex micropylar apparatus. The egg-shell exhibits micromorphological modifications to cope with the endophytic mode of oviposition.

N2  - Although the genus Phyllomacromia Selys, 1878 has for over 40 years generally been considered synonymous with Macromia, a recent study of the male secondary genitalia and caudal appendages has shown these genera to be distinct. They differ markedly in the morphology of the penis, genital ligula, and epiproct, and typically also in that of the cerci and posterior hamules. The forms of the penis and genital ligula of Phyllomacromia are more similar to those of Epophthalmia than to Macromia, while Macromia most closely resembles Didymops in these characteristics. Phyllomacromia probably includes all the African species recently attributed to Macromia.

N2  - This paper presents the results of a preliminary structural survey of the ejaculates of representatives of all major odonate taxonomic groupings. Members of the Zygoptera, Libellulidae and the Corduliidae transfer individual spermatozoa whilst males of the remaining taxa inseminate females with spermatodesms (aggregated sperm) and varying degrees of free spermatozoa. The distribution of spermatodesm use across the reviewed taxa shows a relationship with various aspects of male and female reproductive behaviour. A function for odonate spermatodesms based on this relationship is suggested, and preliminary evidence consistent with the major prediction from this hypothesis is provided.

N2  - Because the actual range of A. caerulea is restricted to the high latitudes of northern Europe and the higher mountains of central Europe, the species is seen as a typical glacial relict, which needs a cool subarctic climate. However, the thermal demands of the larvae are very complex. Young larvae are thermophilic and need more or less constant temperatures of about 20°C, while older larvae generally tolerate the lower temperatures but prefer higher values for moulting and digestion. Due to the brown colour of the water, the dark (peaty) bottom ground and/or the shallowness, typical breeding sites of A. caerulea, are warm habitats even in cold climates, so that quick larval growth is ensured. In contrast to the aquatic microhabitat, the environment of adults is cool, severe and appears uncomfortable for dragonflies. However, the unusual basking behaviour and physiological specializations, especially the physiological colour change in males, make the species well adapted to such microclimatic conditions. Adult preference for lower temperatures thus restricts the distribution of A. caerulea to the cooler climates of the high North and subalpine and alpine zones.

N2  - Mating and oviposition behaviour of this tropical dragonfly was studied at small rain forest pools in West Kenya. Males were present at the oviposition site between 10:00-16:00 h local time. Females visited the pools infrequently. Copulations lasted a mean of 174 s and occurred rarely. Mating and oviposition of one female were spatially and temporally separated. The females deposited eggs unguarded well above the water. During oviposition the female hovered in front of the substrate, keeping the legs attached either the whole time or only during the dip.

N2  - A natural population of I. elegans was studied by mark-recapture techniques in Rome (Italy) during 25 days in June-August 1994. We marked 1043 3 and 957 9 and recaptured one third of them. Recaptured 3 6 were similar to unrecaptured ones in age at marking, date of marking and body size. Recaptured 9 9 were similar to unrecaptured ones in age and size, but were marked earlier. 53% of mature recaptured 3 c and 34% of 9 9 were never observed to mate. The maximum number of matings obtained by a 3 was 3, but 1 9 mated 7 times. The best predictor of male lifetime mating success (LMS) was mature lifespan. Mated 3 were smaller than unmated ones but body length was not correlated with LMS. The probability that 6 3 marked in copula obtained a second copulation was 7% higher than for 3 3 marked alone. We conclude that /. elegans 9 9 are clearly not monogamous in central Italy.

N2  - The analysis of the aquatic biotopes shows that they can be discriminated on the basis of their species composition and diversity. A first entity, with 2 separate groups of biotopes, is sheltering 24% of the odon. sp., while a second one, with 3 separate groups of biotopes, gives shelter to 76%. The analysis of the odon. fauna indicates that it is composed of 4 entities based on their degree of association. Lestes disjunctus, Leucorrhinia glacialis, L. hudsonica and Coenagrion interrogatum form one entity. A second one is composed of C. resolutum Enallagma hageni, Aeshna constricta, A. juncea, A. umbrosa, Somatochlora albicincta, S. minor and Sympetrum danae. E. boreale, A. eremita, Ophiogomphus colubrinus, Pangaeagaster maculata, Cordulia shurtleffi and Somatochlora cingulata are forming a third entity. The latter includes A. interrupta, A. sitchensis, Dorocordulia libera, A. subarctica. S. forcipata, S. whitehousei and L. proximo.

N2  - The results of a 4-yr study are reported. Data from Surber-samples of 3 running waters in southern France were compared with results from field enclosure experiments. Egg development lasted about one month under field conditions and two weeks at 25°C in the laboratory. O. uncatus has usually but not strictly 13 larval instars and a 3-yr life cycle. Each year emergence started in early June. The emergence curve was typical of a summer sp. Several aspects of seasonal regulation are discussed. The monitoring of population structure indicated a high mortality of final instar larvae (up to 99%) during winter. This mortality differed between the sample sites of one of the running waters. These differences depend on prey availability and on larval density. A field enclosure experiment revealed density dependence of larval size and growth.

The monophyly of Hemeroscopidae is discussed and preliminarily advocated. The Mesozoic Hemeroscopidae are recognized as potential stem-group representatives of extant Chlorogomphoidea within Anisoptera – Cavilabiata. The status of the alleged hemeroscopid larvae is discussed and they are preliminarily transferred as new (unnamed) species to Sonidae. The family Sonidae is restricted to the referring larvae. The adult fossil dragonflies from the Lower Cretaceous of Mongolia that were previously attributed to Sona nectes (Sonidae) are here classified as a new taxon, Proterogomphus krauseorum gen. et sp. nov. (Proterogomphidae fam. nov.) within the monophylum Gomphides, as sister-group of Hageniidae. A new species, Proterogomphus renateae sp. nov. is described from the Upper Jurassic of Germany (Solnhofen Lithographic Limestone). A numerical cladistic analysis of Anisoptera could neither convincingly resolve the phylogenetic relationships within Hemeroscopidae, nor the phylogenetic positions of Gomphides and Proterogomphidae fam. nov., because of their lack of wing venational apomorphies, but otherwise confirmed the phylogenetic reclassification of dragonflies by BECHLY (1996, Petalura [Special Vol.] 2: 342-402),

N2  - Monthly counts of adult odon. were carried out along a transect following a forested mountain stream, «Quebrada Pasaquire». 17 of the 41 spp. recorded were considered for evaluation. The average monthly abundance curve of spp. such as Euthore fasciata Sel., Archilestes grandis (Ramb.), Philogenia cassandra Sel., Progomphus abbreviatus Belle, Brechmorhoga rapax Calv. and Libellula herculea Karsch matches the climogram of the study area, e. g. these spp. are markedly seasonal, with high adult abundances in the wet season, and low numbers in the dry season. On the other hand the presence of adult Hetaerina capitalis Sel. and H. cruentata (Ramb.) did not seem to be correlated with season Macrothemis pseudimitans Calv. and Micrathyria venezuelae De Marmels appeared to be more common in the dryer months, but their population sizes were always low. Based upon the data of this survey it can be stated that the odon. community studied has a persistent structure, relatively low variabilities of population densities, and is stable. The evidence includes persistence of the dominant taxa over at least 5 generations, typical standard deviations of the logarithm of population sizes, as well as high and significant year-to-year rank concordance. Cannaphila vibex (Hag.) and Progomphus abbreviatus became more common during this survey, while Andaeschna rufipes (Ris) shifted towards local extinction. However, 5 yr may not be sufficient to show such trends to be irreversible: in almost all species at least one trend reversal occurred during the survey. Some of the potential ecological mechanisms underlying the constancy and stability of this odonate community are discussed and it is suggested that abiotic factors, such as periodical floods in this lotic habitat, may be of some concern.

N2  - The reproductive behaviour in a high-density situation of the sp. was investigated in northern Poland in 1993 and 1995. Because of their high density, males were non-territorial. After a very brief tandem flight, copulations took place either on the ground or in the surrounding pine trees and lasted, on average, 640 s. Afterwards the male guarded the female while she was on post-copulatory rest (PCR). During PCR (which occurred in 11 out of 13 observed cases), the male bent his abdomen tip up to the basal segments after a mean time of 81 s. This behaviour was interpreted as intra-male sperm translocation (ST). Oviposition took place over open water. During mating time, from 10:00 h to about 17:00 CEST, almost none of the observed ovipositions was completed undisturbed. Outside this time, half of the ovipositions observed was completed undisturbed. The latter lasted 34 s, in which the female had an average frequency of 0.6 to 1.9 dips per s. Eleven hand-held ovipositions revealed a mean egg number of 327 eggs per female and a mean egg flow rate of 4,6 eggs s '. It is concluded that the mating system of L. albifrons is best described as a combination of resource limitation and female control. Some known effects of high male density on the reproductive behaviour of the Libellulidae are discussed.

N2  - The population structure was studied in a small stream in a cool temperate zone of Japan in 1989 and 1990, using a mark-release-recapture method. The estimated daily number of males was 500 (1989) and 150(1990), while that of females was 450 (1989) and 100 (1990). The operational sex ratio in each year was probably unity. The daily estimate number of immigrants in each year was ca. 10% of the population, and the daily survival rate was more than 80%. Therefore, the populations in both years were considered to be closed. The distribution of each individual perching was surveyed. The perching site of the damselfly depended upon the sunlit area on the bank of the stream. Accordingly, they concentrated on the west bank during the morning, and the east bank during the afternoon. However, along the bank the perching sites of males was shown to be a regular distribution, due to territorial behaviour. There were many small insects that could be prey for the damselflies along the stream and the edge of the paddy fields nearby. Dipteran insects were dominant potential prey in this habitat. Since the habitat of the damselfly is surrounded by paddy fields and lakes, the maintenance of the population probably depends upon the abundance of substrate for oviposition and the larval habitat.

N2  - In search of receptive females, the males of many corduliids patrol over open water. Additionally, some species exhibit localized patrol flights also over terrestrial sites. In open fen habitats, Somatochlora flavomaculata may be an extreme case in this respect as it conspicuously patrols often away from water. In consideration of its possible function the terrestrial patrol flights were investigated in a descriptive and experimental field study and compared with those at aquatic sites. Typically, the males patrolled close to vertical structures such as trees and bushes or over footpaths in glades of reedbeds. No relevant differences between the patrol fligths at aquatic and terrestrial localities were found. Both types of flight were territorial in function as conspecific males were vigorously driven away. It is speculated that the males establish territories away from ponds because the occurrence of females is unpredictable, the preferred ovipostion sites (shallow and largely overgrown puddles) being scattered over large areas. Hence, the best strategy for males for intercepting mates would be to patrol near vertical structures serving as landmarks and guidelines for arriving females.

N2  - The Amazonian Campina is a woodland, with emergent trees of about 10 m, found in patches in the Amazonian rain forest. It usually has open areas with a white sand soil directly exposed to sun, and shaded areas with a more dense vegetation. I sampled the dragonfly assemblage in this system counting every dragonfly at pre-determined points, at 5 min intervals, between 7:00 and 18:00 h. Erythrodiplax lativittata, Miathyria marcella and Erythemis vesiculosa were the most abundant spp. The frequency data by point revealed an association of E. lativittata (percher) with shaded habitats, and M. marcella and E. vesiculosa (fliers) with open habitats. The characteristics of thermoregulation of fliers and perchers seem to explain this microhabitat selection. Due to high productivity and density of small insects, the Campina is probably an excellent habitat for foraging. It is suggested that in these foraging habitats the spatial species arrangement is mostly determined by behavioural-physiological traits, which may help to explain the community faunal composition.

N2  - The habitat and the territorial and reproductive behaviours of this recently discovered Bornean euphaeid damselfly are described. It breeds in narrow shady streams in lowland forest in northern Borneo. Territories are defended vigorously against conspecific males. Some fights take the form of head to head contests during which the combatants can fly high into the forest canopy. Males show considerable site tenacity and return day after day to the same small section of stream. Females climb underwater down protruding branches to oviposit into decaying twigs or leaves. Males remain perched above the oviposition site during the early part of the oviposition bout, but increasingly towards the end, return regularly to their preferred territorial perches.

N2  - The pattern of Odonata species-richness in Britain is mapped at 10 km resolution. This is strongly correlated with mean air temperatures. The relationship with seasonal and monthly mean temperatures is explored: summer temperatures are better predictors of overall dragonfly richness than are winter temperatures. However, there appears to be some latitude variation in the relationship. Thus, in northern Britain, increasing Odonata richness is correlated with increasing summer temperatures for non-boreal species, and with decreasing winter temperatures for predominantly-boreal species; physiological adaptations of individual species are proposed as a possible explanation.

N2  - Thermoregulation in S. frequens was investigated throughout its adult life, from emergence to reproduction. Data were analyzed by the least squares method. Body temperature was highly correlated to ambient temperature in the sun in the teneral stage and as the life stage advanced the correlation of body temperature to ambient temperature was lowered. Sexual differences were confirmed on thermoregulation; in the male the correlation decreased, whereas, in the female it decreased less. Males have lower body temperatures at high ambient temperatures than the females, and when ambient temperatures were low at the reproductive period in autumn, they maintained high body temperatures. The sexual difference of Tb ranged 2.5-3.4°C. This seem to be due to the sexual difference in body size. Females have smaller thorax and are likely to be influenced by ambient temperature. Because of the small thorax, females seem to be tolerant of high ambient temperature. High body temperature in ovipositing males were not caused by metabolic heat production at the tandem flight, but by the elevation of it during copulation. At low ambient temperatures males were seen warming up at the last stage of copulation. Body temperature in non-contact ovipositing females approximated to that of ovipositing males in tandem and the duration of the former was shorter than that of the latter. 5. frequens, in spite of small size and disadvantage for warm-up, is a periodic endotherm.

N2  - Dragonfly communities were surveyed at 24 sites in 2 adjacent study regions, during the summer of 1994. In each of the 2 regions, 12 sites were grouped into 3 different study areas based on forest status. Forest status was determined by stand age and time since last logging disturbance, resulting in study areas defined as old-growth forest, mature second-growth forest, or recently clear-cut areas. Study sites within each forest-status study area included stream, pond, lake, and bog/swamp habitats. Recently-cleared forest areas exhibited the lowest species number and species diversity, while the greatest species number and diversity were found in the old-growth study areas. These differences were correlated with different vegetation structure variables characteristic of each forest-status study area. Furthermore, Beta-diversity, indicating changes in species composition across the forest-status gradient in each study area, was greater between the sites adjacent to the smallest old-growth forest “habitat island”. These findings may be of importance in understanding dragonfly response to forest disturbance in the northern Minnesota landscape mosaic.

N2  - A 9 was observed to attach eggs onto the underside of a leaf hanging more than 2 m above the water level of a small rainforest stream in Costa Rica. It was found that the eggs usually remain in this position until the larvae hatch. This type of oviposition, the first recorded in a member of the subfamily Brachydiplactinae, is similar to that of some Old World Tetratheminae and it is suggested to be a case of convergence due to similar environmental conditions. Its adaptive significance is discussed briefly.

N2  - By means of the fixation of different copulation stages of 17 European species (16 Zygoptera, I Anisoptera) the possible use and limitation of a new fixation method, using chloroethane, is described. Only in 2 spp. did the fixation attempts fail. In 15 cases the contact points of the tandem linkage could be analysed. The best phase for fixation is the wheel position; only in Lestes and some Coenagrionidae is the postcopulatory tandem suitable as well. If both the inferior and superior male appendages act like forceps, as in Calopteryx, only a few attempts are necessary to yield fixations of high quality. In other species up to ten pairs are required to achieve satisfactory results to evaluate the contact points of the tandem linkage.

N2  - To understand the relationship between copulation duration and sperm precedence in I. senegalensis, which mate for several hours, laboratory experiments and field observation were conducted. By irradiated male techniques, P2 value (sperm precedence of the last male to mate) was measured. P2 value was almost 100 % until 2 days after copulations regardless of the copulation duration. The interval between copulations in a $ was about 2.3 days in the field. It is suggested that the last <J to mate gains advantages in sperm precedence regardless of the copulation duration in the field. And complete sperm mixing (the point when the P2 value was 50 %) occurred 6 days after copulation.

N2  - The life history was studied from June 1993 through April 1995 in a rainfed rice field of Bandar Bara District in Kedah, Peninsular Malaysia. Larval growth was more uniform during early instars. Increasing variations of growth were obvious during the later instars, especially in the final instar. Plots of head width against wing bud length and body length enabled instars to be determined. Larval development was asynchronous and a maximum of 8 larval instars was found on one sampling occasion. 4 emergences were observed in 1994, in March, May, July and October. In general emergence was relatively synchronized. The E50 values were achieved within the first 38%, 9% and 16% of the total duration of emergences 2, 3, and 4 respectively. A relatively short life cycle, continual breeding and oviposition, synchronous emergence and immediate reproduction after a dry period ensure survival of N. tullia in the unpredictable rainfed rice ecosystem.

N2  - Dragonflies are important conservation subjects and excellent indicators of terrestrial and aquatic environmental conditions. To date, 155 spp. have been recorded in South Africa; 29 spp. (18.7%) are endemic. Metacnemis angusta and Paragomphus dicksoni are only known from female specimens and are of doubtful taxonomic status. Chlorolestes apricans, C. draconica, Ecchlorolestes nylephtha, E. peringueyi, Metacnemis valida, Pseudagrion inopinatum, P. unsingaziense, Enallagma polychromaticum, Ceratogomphus triceraticus, Syncordulia gracilis, S. venator, Orthetrum rubens and Urothemis luciana are ecologically threatened. Chlorolestes apricans and U. luciana are of particular concern. C. apricans, whose populations have declined in recent years, appears not to occur in any protected area. There are several significant sites/areas for Odon.: the Western Cape has several endemic spp., while the Amatola-Winterberg mountain range of the Eastern Cape has 2. KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg has one highly localized endemic. Greater St Lucia is rich in pan-African spp., as well as some highly localized endemics. The Kruger National Park has no indigenous spp., but is rich in spp. representing the typical southern African savanna. There are isolated localities such as Itala and Umtamvuna, which have unusual outlier assemblages. Not all anthropogenic disturbance is harmful to Odon. Small dams play an important role in geographically increasing the overall density of many lentic spp. Similarly, the aquatic weed Pistia enhances local species richness in the Kruger National Park. Most major human disturbances however, are harmful to population levels. Exotic tree plantations within 30m of the river’s edge reduce species richness. The rainbow trout is implicated in causing range retraction of the very rare and threatened E. peringueyi, while removal of natural forest in the southern Cape has eliminated populations of the equally rare E. nylephtha. Cattle grazing, resulting in bank vegetation destruction, and black wattle infestations along Eastern Cape river banks have had a major adverse impact on C. apricans. These factors are synergistic with lowered water levels in causing population fragmentation. Of great concern from this survey is that presence of rare species in nature reserves does not necessarily guarantee their survival. Orthetrum robustum at St Lucia, and O. brachiale, O. guineense and O. hintzi at Mpenjati reserves were abundant in 1990 but absent in 1994 because the intervening dry years had dried out their pools. Management recommendations include avoidance of siltation, eutrophication, salination, cattle trampling of banks, and planting of exotic trees on banks within 30m of edge. Recommendations also include maintaining a constant water level in lakes and reservoirs, encouraging an abundance of aquatic macrophytes, and maintaining a wide range of physical bank and shallow water conditions so that there is a variety of substrate types, vegetation structures and sun/shade conditions.

N2  - To analyze the genetic differences, M. pruinosa and M. nawai were collected in 2 localities of Fukuoka Pref. Kyushu, Japan. In the Hisayama area, 2 forms of M. pruinosa 6 <J occur, viz. orange winged f. esakii and clear winged f. strigata, and one 5 form with clear wings f. sieboldi. In the Kami-ishigama area, M. pruinosa and M. nawai both occur and the forms of M. pruinosa are also f. esakii, f. strigata and f. sieboldi. 2 forms of M. nawai 6 i are also found, the orange winged f. nawai and the pale-orange winged f. sahoi, and one 9 form with pale-orange wings f. 9 -nawai. The genetic differences among the samples collected in the areas were assessed by electrophoretic analysis. 21 protein loci of 10 proteins were analyzed by 5 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; 2 of the 21 loci were monomorphic. The most variable strain (f. strigata of M. pruinosa from Hisayama) was highly polymorphic at 18 of the loci (P=0.857), with an average heterozygosity (H) of 0.417. In all strains examined, the ranges of P and H values were 0.667-0.857 and 0.307-0.419, respectively. Nei’s genetic distance (D) was used to distinguish the 6 6 into 2 conspecific groups, the forms of M. nawai as group I, and the forms of M. pruinosa as group II. The $ $ together formed a third group. The genetic distance between groups I and II was close to, but above, the level of intraspecific variation. These results suggest that the <J 6 f. nawai and f. sahoi of M. nawai should be categorized as a single sp., and that f. esakii and f. strigata of M. pruinosa should also be regarded as a single sp., but separate from M. nawai. All the $ 5 showed a genetic relatedness indicating that they are within a single species (D ranging from 0.0595-0.0856), though they include the 2 different spp. of M. nawai (f. 9 -nawai) and M. pruinosa (f. sieboldi). They were the closest to f. strigata of M. pruinosa in the Kami-ishigama area, but the D value to group II was calculated as 0.1804, indicating a level of interspecific variation.

N2  - A brief biography and appreciation of work of Dr Z.R. Adamovic (born 9 March 1923, Obrenovac, Serbia; deceased 1 May 1998, Belgrade. Serbia; curator at the Serbian Natural History Museum and staff member at the Institute for Medical Research; the doyen of Serbian odonatology) are followed by his odonatological bibliography (1948-1997; 27 titles). Most of his papers deal with the fauna of the former Yugoslavia, and combine ecology, morphometry, taxonomy and studies of biogeography. Dr ZIVKO ADAMO TC, was born of a craftsman’s family in Obrenovac near Belgrade, on 9 March 1923. His father Rafailo, a tailor, and his mother Bosiljka, a housewife, also had four daughters. He died in Belgrade on 1 May 1998, after a professionally and privately successful and fulfilled life.

N2  - Soon after amputation of a leg from a final instar larva, granular haemocytes, supported by strands of clotted haemolymph plasma, form a thin cap over the wound, providing the initial wound closure. Cut nerves also appear to attract granular haemocytes and promote organization of a cell sheet covering the wound. Gradually, congregating cells transform the original sheet of cells into a sealing haemocytic plug. Within and across the plug, granular cells form a densely-packed, primary layer like a diaphragm that soon becomes melanized. This is followed later by one or more deeper, secondary layers which also melanize, but to a lesser extent. The primary, melanized layer serves as a pseudocuticle. Its position appears to be determined by the reorganizing epidermis at the wound edge. Presumably the melanized cell layers reduce leakage of haemolymph plasma from the wound and establish barriers against intruding microbes and other foreign bodies. It is suggested that the sequence of cellular events is similar in all kinds of lesions caused to the zygopteran integument, whether by ectoparasitic invasion or physical damage. It is likely that a resultant alteration in the properties of the subepidermal basement membrane will elicit the haemocytic response.

N2  - T. torrida showed territoriality at the water bodies where breeding occurs and also site frdility at the resting sites on tree trunks away from the water. At the latter, residentiality is very localised not only to a specific tree but to a narrow range of height on the tree. Activity patterns at the breeding sites commenced with the male arrival. The density and activity reached an initial peak during mid-morning which coincided with the high day temperature. Aggression peaked at this time although pursued only for brief periods. The duration for perching behaviour was low during reproductive periods which otherwise had longer bouts.

There are various types of trichoid sensilla: 8 labral, 7 mandibular, 14 hypopharyngeal, 8 maxillary and 17 labial. They differ in size and distribution from one another. The acanthae are of 2 types, the labral in the adult and the mandibular in the larva. The basiconic sensilla are found on the labrum of the adult only. The campaniform sensilla are present on the maxillae and labium of the adult and are lacking in the larva. There are 7 types of microtrichia evident on the labrum, hypopharynx and maxillae of the larva and on the hypopharynx and maxillae of the adult. The papillae are present on the inner surface of the labrum in both the larva and the adult. The sensory pegs are confined to the labium of the adult. The spines are located on the labium of the larva and are lacking in the adult. This study is based on SEM and neuro-anatomical staining techniques.

N2  - Dear Gerhard, Your VO1' birthday means much more to the world odonatological community than a mere celebration of a landmark in the life of one of the most distinguished workers in our discipline. It is no exaggeration to say that without your initiatives, manyfold input and continuous encouragement neither the SOCIETAS INTERNATION ALIS ODONATOLOGICA (S.I.O.), nor its mainstream journal, ODONATOLOGICA, could have ever reached their present level. Indeed it was only your enthusiasm to bring together the dragonfly workers of the world by means of an international journal, which greatly inspired the foundation of the organisation, and of this and some other S. I.O. periodicals. Whenever dark clouds threatened our community it was your determination, unshakable loyalty and wise advice that helped us to overcome all the difficulties so decisively. Exactly four decades have passed since your first odonatological publication, in 1959. Since then, the development of odonate research in Germany (and not only in Germany!) has been largely influenced by your work. Your popular field guides, published in huge editions and in various languages, brought dragonflies and damseljlies to the attention of countless European naturalists, and triggered and facilitated much of the faunistic research in Europe. The same is true of your matchless photographic work, based on the innovative macrophotographic techniques you have developed, and published in various European and non-European countries. Much of the modern odonatological research in Germany, Spain, Argentina, Chile and elsewhere has been initiated by you and is being continued by your young “students" and collaborators. The value and utility of numerous dragonfly hooks, in the Netherlands, Slovenia etc., has been much enhanced by the inclusion of your unique photographs.

N2  - A brief biography and appreciation of the work of Dr G. Jurzitza (born 30 Nov. 1929), Professor Emeritus of the University of Karlsruhe, Charter Member of Societas Internationalis Odonatologica and one of the leading European odonatologists, is followed by his odonatological bibliography (1959-1998; 139 titles). Most of his works are related to the European and South American fauna, mostly in the fields of faunistics, taxonomy, ecology and behaviour. The list of taxa he has introduced in Odonata, and a bibliography of his odon. photographic work are also included. GERHARD JURZITZA, the doyen of German odonatology, was born on 30 November 1929, in Ostrava (formerly Schlesisch-Ostrau), Czechoslovakia, into the family of Franz Jurzitza, a professional accountant, from whom he probably inherited his sense of precision and punctuality and his ability for the utmost careful observation of minute, possibly obscured and hardly perceptible detail – a great asset in a naturalist’s career.

N2  - Exuviae were found in sheltered places, most commonly in small cavities under the river banks. The species is able to breed in hydroelectric reservoirs that show marked changes in water level and where riverine vegetation is completely absent. At these places exuviae were found on dead trunks and big rocks, usually in a horizontal upside-down position. In the laboratory, emergence followed the typical aeshnid sequence. Adult, full coloured males showed no yellow spots on abdominal segments 5 and 6, while the spots on segments 4 and 7 were widely variable. 37 adult males of a natural population at the river Lerez were marked. Of these, 12 were resighted 1 to 14 days after marking. Males patrolled over 50-150 m of the river, usually flying straight aljout 30 cm above the water. Females were observed at the river on 21 occasions, and in 19 cases oviposited as soon as they arrived at water. However, mating was recorded only once during 52 h of observation over 18 days. Two more matings were obtained with a tethered female. Since matings at the oviposition sites seem to be rare, it is suggested that copulation is performed mainly at the feeding places. Eggs were scattered by the unaccompanied female by dipping the abdomen 3-10 times for no more than 2 min, in spots of the river as far as 1 m from each other. The importance of forested areas for conservation of this species is discussed.

The sp. only occurs in the alpine region and is not found in the Jura mountains. The data on the vertical distribution are summarized in altitude and climatic categories, differentiated with respect to records of adults and findings of exuviae. Imaginal and larval habitats of the sp. are described inch structural, phytosociological and hydrochemical characteristics of the breeding sites. Possible ecological factors limiting the upper and lower vertical distribution are discussed. The status of the sp. in Switzerland is assessed and conservation measures are suggested.

N2  - Biodiversity is a complex issue, frequently simplified by equating it with species richness. In this paper an assessment of river systems biodiversity in southern Spain is carried out. Four systems here analysed run through mountains of medium altitude and they are remarkable for their acceptable species richness, high proportion of spp. with a restricted western Mediterranean distribution and low ratio of spp. per genus. Species distinctness was estimated according the schemes of R.I. VANE-WRIGHT et al. (1991, Biol. Conserv. 55: 235-254) and R.M. MAY (1990, Nature, Land. 347: 129-130), based on the information content of the topology of a hierarchical classification.

N2  - In canton Beme, Switzerland, the primary school children, aged 6-8, are conscious of dragonflies even before the subject is treated in school. At this age, the child’s imaginative faculty attributes to the dragonfly certain physical features, behavioural propensities, and an imaginary role in nature, which all are to be utilized by the teacher in the process of creating a realistic, simple and to the child comprehensible biological image of the insect. In the Beme school program, dragonflies are dealt with in the framework of the broader instruction topic, “Water”. The steps in the instruction program, as developed by the Authoi during her 40 yr of teaching experience, are briefly outlined, and the scope and depth of the child’s final knowledge on the dragonfly world are stated.

N2  - Odonata assemblages present in the ecotone between subtropical forest and pampasic grassland in Punta Lara were characterized and compared. Four pools, one in the forest, 2 in grassland (one within a protected area) and one at the limit of both environments, were sampled during July 1996-June 1998. For each sampling station species richness and diversity were calculated, and were compared through 2 similarity coefficients (Jaccard and Winer). The highest species richness and diversity were registered in the forest, and the lowest in the protected grassland. Cluster analysis showed different schemes according to the similarity coefficient considered; a greater similarity between the forest and intermediate pools (Jaccard coefficient), or a greater similarity between grassland areas (Winer coefficient). Some biogeographical implications are discussed.

N2  - Casing natural geographical boundaries, 130 spp. can be considered as European, though when broader political borders are followed this number rises to 136. In addition 20 exotic spp, have been recorded as a result of accidental importation. The highest diversity, defined by the number of spp. per standard area of 250x250 km2, is found in the Alps, while the lowest diversity occurs in the northern parts of mainland Europe and on some islands. Surprisingly, the Mediterranean region is not as rich in spp. as the central part of Europe. When compared with other continents, it is clear that Europe has the lowest number of spp. However, when compared specifically with areas at the same latitude, the Odon. diversity in Europe is relatively average: somewhat higher than expected in the northern regions, somewhat lower than expected in southern regions.

N2  - When within the testicular cyst, individual, immature sperm of Lestes sponsa acquire a cap of periacrosomal material. During passage through the spermiducts and vas deferens, the caps of individual sperm coalesce, producing clusters of sperm under a common cap. In Calopteryx virgo, entire sperm cells become embedded in an extracellular homogeneous substance. The joining substance in both species appear to be derived from decomposed surplus cytoplasm sloughed off from developing spermatids. The epithelial lining of the spermiducts adds secretions to this. Clustering of sperm cells was not demonstrated in species of the Coenagrionidae.

N2  - The larva is described and illustrated from four ultimate instar exuviae (2 ? reared) and from a younger larva, all from Venezuela. Main characters are a pointed epiproct and spinous mesial carinae of paraprocts. There is some general similarity with larvae of Boyeria McL., but the latter have angled occipital lobes, longer labium and, in some species, a bifid epiproct. Penis is strikingly similar in Allopetalia and Boyeria, the “cornua” coming closer to those found in Gomphaeschna Sel. than to the “flagella” as found in the brachytrine Spinaeschna Theisch. and in the austropetaliine Rheopetalia Carle. – The “pryeri-group” of Oligoaeschna Sel. is adscribed to Gomphaeschnata LOHMANN (1996, Ent. Z., Essen 106: 209-252), while the “poeciloptera-group” is considered a representative of the archaic Gynacanthini (Aeshnata). Biogeographical problems of Anisoptera, especially those of Gomphaeschnini and Gynacanthini, and of Euphaeida (Zygoptera) are discussed, considering the Pangaea-model and panbiogeographic criteria.

N2  - Observations on male-male tandems are reported; these tandems occur at very low frequency during mate guarding sequences. When initiating a tandem, a male territory resident grabs an intruding male behind the head and flies with him. This behavior is similar to the tandem formation more usually associated with male-female pairs. Because the male-male tandems occurred during mate-guarding and because tandems do not follow courtship of the intruder by the resident, this rare behavior is interpreted as a form of mate guarding rather than misdirected mating behavior.

N2  - Commercial afforestation of natural ecosystems is increasing worldwide. There is little information however, on the extent to which biodiversity is being affected by this practice. This is especially so for stream fauna, including the conspicuous Odon. Some dragonflies and daraselflies may decline when their natural environment is anthropogenically changed and, as a group, they are sensitive to the impact of afforestation.The sites were four pine plantations in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. 14 environmental factors were recorded along stretches of streams running through each of the four sites.The diversity of Odon. spp. and their abundances along these streams were measured.There was a strong positive correlation between certain abiotic factors, for example, boulder cover and shade, with the local distributions of these insects. Water pH was also a strong correlate. Most spp. required both unpolluted water and a sunlit stream. Particular vegetation type and exact distance of pine trees from the water’s edge (so long as they did not shade the stream) were not strong correlates.This meant that species diversity dropped dramatically where the water was completely shaded by a closed canopy, whether it was from natural forest or from exotic trees. It is recommended that no plantation trees should shade a stream edge, and should be planted at least 30m from the water. All highly invasive, dense-canopy weeds, especially Acacia mearnsii, should be removed, and extensive and intensive cattle trampling of the banks avoided.

N2  - Odon. larvae were collected from 50-1190 m elevation in central Nepal’s Gandaki River from 1984 to 1986. Resource partitioning among coexisting odon. spp. at high (>500m) and low (<500m) elevations was investigated by examining their gut contents. At both elevations, diet differences between Anisogomphus occipitalis and Davidius sp. were statistically significant. A. occipitalis ate mostly midges whereas Davidius sp. ate mayflies and caddisflies as well as midges. At low elevation there was no diet difference between A. occipitalis and Paragomphus lineatus nor between the libellulids Crocothemis servilia and Trithemis festiva. Analyses of niche breadths indicate overlap between Davidius sp., Macromia moorei, C. servilia, and T. festiva, and between A. occipitalis and P. lineatus. Significant diet differences in both A. occipitalis and Davidius sp. between low and high elevations may indicate negative interactions in the presence of other coexisting species at low elevation. Similarly, at low elevation both spp. have a narrow niche breadth, a low average number of prey items per gut, and also more empty guts than at high elevation. Mean body weights of studied odon. were relatively higher at lower elevation than at higher elevation. Predatory interactions seemed to be of little or no importance in structuring this lotic odon. assemblage, in contrast with lentic Odonata in other studies.

The holotype will be deposited in the collection of the Natural History Museum (London). The justification for the placement of the new genus in the Tetrathemistinae is presented. Because of the combination of characters of wing venation which it possesses, the new sp. does not fit into any existing genus and the new genus Mesumbethemis is erected to accommodate it. The unique shape of the anal appendages and the accessory genitalia can at this stage also be regarded as characteristic of this presently-monotypic genus.

Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, Japan’s foremost authority on Zen Buddhism and author of over one hundred works on the subject, died in Tokyo in 1966, at the age of 95. In the present work, after briefly explaining what Zen is, he considers in detail various aspects of Japanese art and life that this Buddhist discipline has influenced: the cult of swordsmanship, the tea ceremony, the haiku form of poetry, and the Japanese love of nature. Other essays are devoted to the relationship of Zen and Confucianism, to the role of Zen in the tradition of Samurai, and to Japanese art. – Of ethnoodonatological interest is the reproduction of an early 18th century woodblock print (60 x 104 cm), by an unknown artist, printed by Munakata Shiko, from Suzuki’s coll., titled “The Buddha entering into Nirvana”.

N2  - The reproductive behaviour of C. h. asturica is described. Males fought with each other for the possession of territories which contained the oviposition resource required by females. Females arrived at territories and either copulated and left the territory, copulated and oviposited in that territory or oviposited without a preceding copulation with the territorial male. Territorial males seemed to have a higher mating success than nonterritorial males. Males carried out courtship displays before and after copulation until females finished oviposition. Copulation was divided in two stages which were characterised by the nature of the male’s abdominal flexions. The number of abdominal flexions during stage I and II was 50.2 ± 7.2 and 54.5 ± 16.7 (mean ± s.d.) respectively. The sexual behaviour of both sexes is discussed under current knowledge of sexual selection studies in Calopterygidae.

N2  - The reproductive strategy of the male M. p. costalis can be defined as an attempt to maximize the number of females mated. Males exhibit wing colour dimorphism: one form has orange wings, and the other has hyaline wings which resemble female wings. The former is usually territorial and the latter uses sneaky mate securing tactics around the territories of orange-winged males. Although the length of the emergence period varied from year to year, no evidence of protandry was observed. Studies over 10 years have shown that if the length of the sexually active period in females is stable, the orange-winged males should become sexually mature before females do to achieve maximal reproductive success. On the other hand, the hyaline-winged males do not mature before females due to the fact that they utilize the territories of orange-winged males. This study shows that behavioural protandry should be considered a reproductive strategy of the orange-winged males for establishing territories.

N2  - On 2 evenings in late Oct. 1999 several 5 ? were observed laying eggs in almost dry mud and sand and under mosses, within a temporary pond system, surrounded by rain forest, nr Tiradentes, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The ponds are filled with water during the rainy season (Oct. – March) but dry up entirely by the end of the dry season (Aug. – Sept.). Data compiled from field records, odonatological collections and literature showed that in Brazil G. bifida stays on the wing throughout the year. Apparently, the sp. possesses a univoltine life cycle with 2 generations of larvae, one during the warmer rainy season and another in the early dry season (Oct./Nov. – Jan./Feb. and Feb./March – May/June, respectively). Mud attached to the terminal abdominal segments of V specimens in odonatological collections was used as an evidence of an oviposition mode comparable to that observed in the field.

N2  - All dragonfly enthusiasts will have been greatly saddened to learn that Dr Elliot Pinhey died on 7 May 1999, at the age of 88. He was truly one of the masters of Old World odonatology; his scientific contributions will surely be judged by posterity to have been as important as those ofRis, Fraser, Lieftinck and Asahina. As he had lived so long, many of his generation have now passed on and he had little contact with other enthusiasts for almost the last ten years of his life. I only met him once, when we invited him to talk to the British Dragonfly Society in Leeds about his experiences with African Odonata. He was a most humble, likeable and interesting speaker, and I remember him well for his infectious love of both Africa and African people, as well as for the enthusiasm we all shared for dragonflies. I offer this small contribution with considerable trepidation as I scarcely knew him and I have only been working on African Odonata for a few years, but I found his work to be incredibly accessible and helpful when I was starting out to study African dragonflies, and I would like to express my thanks for the life of such a talented man.

N2  - Male genitalia of 25 spp. are studied using scanning electron microscopy, and the structure of the fourth penile segment is described. Remarkable diversity exists among spp., particularly in the size and shape of the lateral lobes, and the morphology of the cornua. There are also differences in the number of cornua among the taxa surveyed. The surface of the lobes of many spp. is covered with spines which anchor the penis during copulation, and may trap and remove sperm when the penis is collapsed and withdrawn following copulation. Spp. are categorized according to the morphology of the penis and inferred patterns of sperm removal. Type 1 taxa possess relatively large, broad, flat lateral lobes, and lack cornua, or possess cornua that are greatly reduced in size. These spp. are believed to displace sperm in the bursa copulatrix before depositing their own sperm, thereby gaining positional priority during oviposition. Type 2 spp. possess elongated lateral lobes and/or cornua. These taxa are believed to engage in a mixed strategy of sperm displacement and sperm removal. Optimization of these characters on a phylogeny of the 3 genera indicates that the Type 1 sperm displacement strategy is ancestral, and that the Type 2 strategy was subsequently derived within the majority of the Libellula s.s. taxa.

N2  - A checklist of 48 spp. recorded from the island of Bioko (3°30’N 8°40’E), based on historical records compiled by Dr Elliot Pinhey and augmented by a collection made in March-April 1999, is presented, together with notes on the distribution of the spp. on the island. The Odonata fauna apparently comprises 2 elements, an upland fauna which includes 6 spp. that only occur above 500 m, and a lowland fauna of 17 spp., none of which occurs above 500 m. A further 13 spp. have been found in both lowland and upland sites. There are insufficient published data on the remaining 13 spp. to assign them to either of these faunistic elements. In addition, unique fan-shaped setae on the dorsum of the head, thorax and abdomen of early instar libellulid larvae are described. These setae are thought to be mechano-receptors that are held above the sediment to detect the presence of prey and current flow while the larva remains buried.

N2  - Preliminary considerations concerning the species diversity of East African dragonflies and the problems of identifying and using such diversity figures are given. For a detailed approach the basic problem is lack of sufficient data in that area. A checklist of species recorded so far for East Africa is given. Looking at pure species number in relation to area, Uganda is definitely more important for dragonfly diversity than its eastern neighbouring countries. If taking endemism and taxonomic singularity into account, the coastal forests of Tanzania and Kenya are very important too.

N2  - The sp. inhabits streams and rivers in the mountain forests of the Indian Ocean of La Reunion. Because of heavy seasonal rainfalls and steep inclines, there are drastic changes of water level. As a consequence, no water plants, roots or wet driftwood at all are available for oviposition. The sp. seems to be well adapted to this habitat: females oviposit into wet soft and porous lava stones. The closely related C. insularis and C. rufipes inhabit streams and rivers on Mauritius, where there are less extreme conditions. Both spp. deposit eggs in plant tissue.

N2  - Genetic methods are often utilised for the ecological study of odon, spp. In many instances, especially from a conservation standpoint, it is desirable to employ a method of extracting DNA that does not affect the subsequent survival of the animal under investigation. Removal of part of an odon. leg has been demonstrated not to affect the subsequent reproductive success of the animal. Thus for odonates, a simple and quick method of extracting DNA from a portion of an odon. leg is presented that provides high yields of DNA suitable for PCR.

N2  - Long-term monitoring of a remnant population of M. xanthomelas, located at Triplet Army Medical Center (TAMC) began in May 1997 and continued to Febr. 2000 for the mitigation ponds and June 2000 for the TAMC stream. This sp. has been reduced to little more than 100 m of stream habitat on Oahu at the TAMC. Threats to M. xanthomelas include alien fish spp., stream dewatering, and habitat alteration. The TAMC stream now requires augmented water flow because construction of a facility up gradient of the TAMC stream disrupted the normal hydrology of the small stream. The Oahu race of M. xanthomelas will soon become extinct if the stream were allowed to become dry, as nearly happened in June 1997. The most cost-effective way to ensure the survival of this sp. on Oahu would be to continue some mitigation water flows to the TAMC stream. The next step would be the establishment of another wild population to a stream lacking alien fish spp. It is highly recommended that a cooperative association of biologists from the Bishop Museum, University of Hawaii, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Army environmental staff continue to monitor the population of M. xanthomelas, arguably the rarest insect population in the United States,

N2  - The pattern of the number of spp. per pond changed completely between 1988 and 2000. The growth of scrub on the edges of the ponds caused a decline in the number of dragonfly spp. when more than 50% of pond edge was shaded by bushes. When the ponds were completely shaded they lost all their dragonfly spp. The decline in spp. appeared to be caused by shading rather than changes in the aquatic flora caused by shading. When the scrub was not controlled the ponds were inhabited by dragonflies from 26 to at least 39 yr. In ponds where no scrub developed, or where it was controlled, Coenagrion paella, Ischnura elegans, Libellula quadrimaculata. Aeshna cyanea, Sympetrum striolatum and Sympetrum sanguineum were still continuing to inhabit the ponds after 39 yr. Aeshna grandis, which had occurred most yr. in the 1962-1988 period, was still present in 2000. Pyrrhosoma nymphula and Brachytron pratense, which had bred from 1964 to 1972 and 1968 to 1973 respectively, both reappeared after 20 yr. absence. Their return to the ponds appeared to be connected with their increase in adjacent habitats at Woodwalton Fen in the 1989-2000 period. Anax imperator and Libellula fulva, which had also increased at Woodwalton Fen, were seen for the first time at the ponds during this period. The reason for the recent disappearance of Lestes sponsa firm the ponds and adjacent habitats is not known. This study yet further emphasises the need to conserve large core populations of dragonflies, and it reiterates the need for really long term monitoring.

N2  - This synopsis includes diagnoses for adults, a key for S cf and $ 5, illustrations of taxonomic characters and updated distribution data for each sp. The ventral terga contour is found to vary interspecifically allowing identification of all species. Other useful characters are the presence or absence of black stripes over frontoclypeal and fronto-ocular grooves, abdominal colour pattern and shape of the cerci. Some colour characters of A. variegata vary geographically and two forms are described: a dark (humid biomes) and light form (dry biomes). The synonymy of A. peralta and A. variegata is considered doubtful.

N2  - On several occasions aggregations were seen hovering high among trees beside streams in Mexico. Intermittent arrival of nonspecific $ $ at some aggregations and their departure, sometimes in tandem, and the apparent absence of foraging within aggregations supports the inference that such aggregations are mating swarms. It remains to be discovered whether trees over which swarms form are potential oviposition sites for this sp., or are places in which both 3 3 and 9 9 overnight Flying aggregations of c5 3 in other spp. of Protoneuridae are described and discussed.

N2  - During copulation and before sperm transfer, odon. 3 6 are able to manipulate rival sperm stored in the $ sperm storage organs (usually the bursa copulatrix and spermathecae). 3 3 of the territorial C. h. asturica use 2 mechanisms for this. Bursal sperm is removed physically whilst spermathecal sperm is displaced via aedeagal stimulation (through a series of abdominal flexions) of the $ sensory system that controls spermathecal sperm ejection. Most bursal sperm is removed but there is individual variation in spermathecal sperm displacement Previous results have found that this variation is related to aedeagal width. In this paper 4 variables that may also explain variation in spermathecal sperm displacement ability are investigated: 3 age and status (territorial and nonterritorial), duration of the sperm displacement stage and the number of aedeagal stimulatory flexions. Variation in the ability to displace spermathecal sperm, however, was not related to these variables. This suggests that variation in this ability is reliant only on 3 genitalic attributes, aedeagal width. These results are briefly discussed in terms of current theory of sexual selection as the process propelling genitalic evolution.

N2  - From May 1997 to April 1998 larvae were recorded at the Weidlingbach, a fourth order tributary of the Danube nr Vienna, at 12 sampling stations from source to mouth. From the 14 larval instars reported for the genus, 5 (F to F-4; based on head width) could be identified in both spp.; head widths of $ larvae were significantly larger than in 3. — Both spp. were most abundant within medium sand sediments with a mean grain size (Q J of 2.04 mm in C. bidentata and 2.79 mm in C. heros. Mean water depths and nose current speeds measured at larval microhabitats were 4.4 cm and 2.3 cm s’1 ( (C. bidentata) and 5.6 cm and 2.6 cm s'1 ( (C. heros). During the winter months larvae chose the water depths slightly deeper than during summer. Throughout the observation period, a high proportion of the larvae (C. bidentata; 70-100%; C. hems'. 41-90%) were burrowed in sandy sediments, either totally or displaying the typical ambush posture with only head and anal pyramid visible. In winter, the proportion of burrowing larvae was insignificantly higher than in summer. — C. bidentata larvae were most abundant near the sources, preferring first order stream sections (discharge 0.1-3.2 Is1) with high hardness (up to 34 German degrees) and conductivity (up to 1100 pS cm1) and a high proportion of fine sediments. Although C. hems larvae were also collected at such first order sites, they reached their highest abundance (larval density up to 7.84 specimens per 10 meter shore length) at second order stream sections (discharge 0.3-6.0 I s1) with lower hardness and conductivity and a higher proportion of coarse sediments.

N2  - According to their social status, the 3 3 are divided into 2 categories: territory holders (territorial 3 3) and non-territory holders (wandering 33). The duration of copulation was longer in wandering (461.5±347.8 s, n = 46) than in territorial pairs (201.3±149.8 s, n = 85). Oviposition modes are 3-fold: viz. (1) single, with non-contact guarding (territorial pairs: 115.1±75.5 s, n = 27; wandering pairs: 133.9±45.5 s, n = 14); — (2) tandem oviposition (territorial pairs: 214.6±76.6 s, n = 5; wandering pairs: 141.0±76.2 s, n = 7); — and (3) tandem oviposition + non-contact guarding (NCGO) (territorial pairs: 131.6±93.8 s, n = 5; wandering pairs: 157.5±72.8 s, n=2). The first type was most common in territorial (75%) and in wandering pairs (62.1 %). The second type was in wandering pairs (24.1 %) twice as frequent as in territorial pairs (10.4%). The third mode was infrequent (territorial pairs: 14.6%, wandering pairs: 13.8%). The relationships between 3 social status and the interference of territorial 3 (J on one hand, and the duration of copulation and the oviposition mode on the other, are discussed. The effects of vegetation and air temperature on the oviposition mode are briefly outlined.

N2  - Five spindle-shaped sperm ‘pellets’ (bundles) were found in the vagina of copulation-interrupted androchrome 2. The second and third pellets had a long thin tail while the fourth had partly and the fifth completely disintegrated. In an other 2, the vagina was packed with sperm material even though the sperm storage organs (spermatheca and bursa copulatrix) were completely filled. It is proposed that this sp. exhibits a transitional reproductive behaviour with respect to sperm competition.

N2  - In a small isolated population along a small stream in NE Spain, a high proportion of the adults present were individually marked. During subsequent days, their locations were assessed by twice-daily surveys along the entire length of the stream. Mean daily survival rates in mature <J 3 and 2 2 and pre-reproductive 3 6 were similar, 94%. Only during the first day after marking were survival rates significantly lower (viz. 77 to 84% in the various groups). High proportions (around 90%) of mature 3 3 were found to return to the same (territory) site every morning once they had occupied that site for 2 or more days. Site fidelity was low in pre-reproductive 3 3 and intermediate in mature 2 2. In a displacement experiment, 67 territorial 3 3 were transferred one by one to distant locations (80 to 240 m along the stream). Half of them returned to their original territory, usually on the same day.

In the larvae and adults, microspines on the surface of the longitudinal folds of the pharynx, and dome-shaped, beaded structures on the inner surface of the oesophagous are evident. In the larvae, the folds of the crop bear long hairs laterally and parallel rows of microspines medially. In the larvae, the proventriculus is provided with 4 longitudinal plates; 2 large plates with teeth on each lateral side and 2 small plates each with 4 fine apical teeth, on either side. Scale-like acanthae are observed near the stomodeal valve. A whorl of long hairs is evident in the stomodeal valve. In the adult dragonfly, the acanthae and curved spines occupy the anterior and posterior regions of the proventricular dental plates, respectively. The functional significance of various stomodeal cuticular structures is discussed.

N2  - In the course of a 2-yr mark-resighting study on S. alpestris at 2000 m a.s.l. in the Central Alps of Switzerland snow fell during the beginning of the reproductive period in July 2000. The snow cover was up to 30 cm thick and remained for about 8 days. Only 3% of the individuals marked as tenerals and 4% of those marked as matures before the cold spell were resighted afterwards. In 1998 (a season without snow) the corresponding resighting proportions amounted 10% and 54% respectively. In 2000, at a second study site at 1700-1800 m, 11 % of the individuals marked as matures before the cold spell were found again. It is concluded that, unlike the aquatic stages, the imagines of S. alpestris are not well adapted to survive cold periods with snowfall lasting more than a few days. Various survival strategies focused on egg and larval development of the sp. are discussed with respect to adaptation to a subarctic climate.

It contains records of 29 specimens from 10 spp. with zebra mussels including 2 new records. The possibilities how this association between odonate larvae and zebra mussels comes into being are discussed. Considering the biology and the life history of the mussels, from a few of the recorded cases of this interaction it is assumed that the larval development of the Odonata involved is more variable than hitherto known.

N2  - Several spp. of odonates have been the subject of sexual selection studies. In non-territorial species most variance in lifetime mating success (LMS) is accounted for by lifespan and specially by the number of visits, and random factors (like rainy weather) can have strong effect on reproductive success. Here we present the study of 2 natural populations of I. graellsii by marking-recapture methods. Our results show that <J mating success is related to body size, mobility and handling damage, but not to fluctuating asymmetry. Larger 6 6 had greater success in both populations, a result in agreement with previous findings on the same sp. Nevertheless, multivariate analyses indicate that body length was a significant correlate of LMS in just one of the studied populations. We estimated a mobility index for c? 6 averaging the distance between consecutive resightings. For long-lived <J <J, we found a positive relationship between mobility and LMS. There was ft clear effect of leg loss during marking on survivorship, and a marginally significant negative effect on LMS. Finally, we studied the effect of wing fluctuating asymmetry (FA) on LMS by capturing a sample of marked individuals at the end of field work. Results suggest that FA is not an important correlate of LMS in this sp.

N2  - Solar exposure is a key factor determining odonate activity, particularly in tropical areas. Small sized perchers, classified as thermal conformers, can begin their activity when air temperature is sufficiently high, and larger species become active when direct exposure to the sun is possible. In this study, the activity patterns in a neotropical dragonfly assemblage present on the Federal University of Vigosa, SE Brazil, have been described and following predictions about their thermoregulatory behaviour tested: (a) a decrease in activity of the percher dragonflies in the warmest periods is expected due to high thoracic temperatures; (b) conformers species will be controlled by temperature, not luminosity, whereas in heliothermic species, the initiation and termination of their activity is only constrained by luminosity. In the dry season, low air temperatures represent a limiting factor to the beginning and the end of activity, resulting in a shorter total activity time. Orthemis discolor and Micrathyria hesperis showed a decrease in activity in the middle of the day in the rainy season. Perithemis mooma was the only sp. that had a higher abundance near midday. As this sp. had a light-coloured thorax compared to the others, it is suggested that it could minimize the effect of the high temperatures. There is a clear effect of season on activity time, and also large differences in the intensity of this effect among species. When clouds precluded direct exposure to sun, variations only in the temperature did not affect the activity of Erythrodiplax fuse a. M. hesperis and O. discolor, but the activity of the small sized I P. mooma remained dependent on temperature. These results highlighted that the minimum body size to be a heliotherm could be a complex function of behavioural and morphological characteristics, including body colour, preferred substrate and perch posture.

N2  - Comparative morphology identifies Chromagrion as the sister genus of Pyrrhosoma Charp. The genera Hesperagrion, Anisagrion Selys, Apanisagrion Kennedy and Calvertagrion St. Quentin probably form a monophyletic group as they share a bifid apical penis segment armed with a pair of sclerotized spine-like processes. A new interpretation of certain penis structures, and biogeographic considerations, suggest that Zoniagrion is probably a primitive genus, which occupies a basal position on the stem of the Acanthagrion-series, within the ischnurine Coenagrionidae.

N2  - The Red-Listed African Odon. spp. are re-assessed and are assigned or re-assigned to the IUCN Categories of Threat. It is important to distinguish between those species that are simply rare, those that are ‘Data Deficient’ and those that are genuinely threatened. It is also important to consider the ‘Extinct’ category very carefully as premature inclusion of a taxon in this category can preclude further searches for it. The IUCN Categories of Threat were found to be very workable for the African Odon. Problems are more to do with the practicalities of doing the field assessments, rather than with the categorisation itself. While the Red List is of enormous value when considering one species at a time, it should not be seen as a generalized data base amenable to comparative assemblage statistics, which are likely to reveal more on assessment efforts than on the organisms.

N2  - SEM studies reveal that the egg chorion of T. virginia is divided into an outer soft exochorion and an inner tough endochorion. The exochorion expands into a jelly-like, sticky coat in water, while the endochorion is smooth, thin and unsculptured. The apically situated micropylar apparatus is formed of a large, dome-shaped, sperm-storage chamber and a small, flat, micropylar stalk which contains a pair of circular micropylar orifices. The micropylar apparatus is encircled by an exochorionic collar. The chorion is modified in accordance with the aquatic (still-water) mode of oviposition exhibited by this species while the micropylar apparatus is shaped to fit in the fertilization pore of the vagina.

N2  - 22 specimens of dicotyledon leaves with egg-sets of fossil Zygoptera, originating from a locality NE of Frankfurt/Main, Germany and preserved in SMF, Frankfurt/Main are described, illustrated and discussed. In the past (1846, H.R. Goeppert, Die Gattungen der fossilen Pflanzen, Henry & Cohen, Bonn), these structures were misinterpreted as saprophytes, “ Hysterites opegraphoides”. The true nature of the sets is apparent from fossil and recent evidence; they are to be attributed to the “coenagrionid type” of oviposition, more particularly to the so-called “Zickzack- und Bogenmodus” mode sensu M. Hellmund & W. Hellmund, 1991 (Stung. Beitr. Naturk. [B] 177: 1-17). Herewith the phenomenon is recorded for the first time from the Middle Miocene and the Lower Neogene (age ca 15 mio yr), though this oviposition mode is practised since the Upper Cretaceous times (ca 90 mio yr ago) until present. In some Tertiary localities, e.g. Messel (Hesse) and Hammerunterwiesenthal (Saxony), egg-sets are the only evidence of the Zygoptera occurrence.

N2  - Community structure of odon. larvae was investigated at El Saucillo (ES) and San Francisco (SF) streams, from August 1995 to July 1996. Species richness (S), species composition, Margalef's richness index (R), Shannon-Wiener's diversity index (FT), Hill's evenness index (E), and rareness (Rs) were used to describe and compare the communities. Annual variation of the indices was examined within and among streams. Streams were significantly different in terms of physical/chemical variables, and faunistic similarity between the communities was quite low (37%). Mean larval density was highest at ES, but the remaining parameters were highest at SF, Global richness was 31 spp. and some spp. such as Hetaerina americana, Enallagma civile, Anax junius. Erpetogomphus elaps, Dythemis nigrescens, Aeshna multicolor, A. dugesi, Erythemis plebeja and the majority of Argia spp. were only found at SF. More abundant spp. at SF were Pseudoleon superbus, Telebasis salva, Libellula saturata and Enallagma praevarum, while those more abundant at ES were Paltothemis lineatipes and Argia anceps.

N2  - Three different types of toxicological test were conducted, viz. the standard toxicological test at varying pH, a test with starved larvae and a test with different ionic composition of the water. For the larvae of L. sponsa, ammonia toxicity was examined only in the standard test at one pH value and in the test with varying ionic composition of the medium. Total ammonia was more toxic at elevated than at low pH to both S. flaveolum and E. najas larvae. In contrast, toxicity based on the un-ionized form appeared to increase with decrease in pH value. In general, larvae of all spp. have a high ammonia tolerance when compared to other aquatic animals. Tests with starved larvae showed that the ammonia tolerance of starved larvae of ' S. flaveolum was 3.7 times greater than that for the fed ones; for E. najas, this difference was only 1.2 times, explanations of this effect are discussed. Tests in varying ionic composition of the water illustrated that the absence of sodium ions accounts for a considerable increase in ammonia toxicity. It is interesting that a similar trend was found for fishes and crustaceans. Mechanistic explanations, which may differ from that for other groups, are proposed. Odon. larvae seem to be unsuitable for the bioindication of ammonia pollution.

N2  - An analysis of the time-budget and a description of reproductive behaviour at a small pond in Vigosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil are presented. The observations support the classification of this sp. as a percher. It also conforms to the predictions of other studies that large perchers are usually more aggressive toward conspeciftcs. E. plebeja S S were usually observed simulating oviposition in the areas they previously defended, and evolutionary aspects of this behaviour are discussed.

Recently acquired material from the Nicobar Isis (Camorta and Great Nicobar) reveals that the original type series of Micromerus blandus consists of 2 close, but distinct spp. A 6 specimen (in ZMUC) from Nancowry Island is designated as the lectotype of blanda. Former syntype 9 9 from Little Nicobar belong to a new sp., described here as L. balus sp.n,, holotype (deposited at RMNH. Leiden) of which comes from Great Nicobar Island, Campbell Bay area, 24-XII-2000. 33 of L. blanda and L. balus sp.n. differ in the colour pattern of abdomen and in the shape of rhinarium.

N2  - Although the odon. fauna of the Mexican state of Nayarit has been considered well-known, a 7-day visit there in Sept. 2001 resulted in records of 21 spp. new for the state, bringing the state total to 120 spp., fifth highest in Mexico, Records from a 2-day visit in Aug. 1965 are also listed, many of them the first specific localities published for Nayarit, and the first records of 2 spp. from Sinaloa are also listed. The biology of most neotropical spp. is poorly known, so natural-history notes are included for many spp, A storm-induced aggregation and a large roost of dragonflies is described. The odon. fauna of Nayarit consists of 2 primary elements: a large number of neotropical spp. reaching their northern known limits, and a montane fauna of the drier Mexican Plateau. At least 57 spp. of tropical origin reach their northern distribution in the western Mexican lowlands in or N of Nayarit, and these limits must be more accurately defined to detect the changes in distribution that may be taking place with global climate change.

N2  - Six populations of the Enallagma cyathigerum complex from North Africa, Europe and West and Central Asia were examined, mainly using DNA analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The taxa deserti and risi are geographic ssp. to E. cyathigerum: although 3 3 can unequivocally be identified from their superior anal appendages, their 18 S rDNA and intergenic spacers ITS 1 and 2 are identical. Moreover, morphological intermediates have become known between deserti and cyathigerum, and between risi and cyathigerum. The habitat choice (predatory fish tolerated but with difficulty) and salinity tolerance of all 3 are similar as well. It is concluded that they share a common origin, and only recently started to diverge.

N2  - Dear Norman, No doubt, if they could, dragonflies would enthusiastically celebrate today’s 80h birthday of the man who spent more than six decades of his life studying their habits and, above all, promoting the protection of their habitats, in a life devoted to conservation. They are perhaps not aware of the way many of their homes would look, and of the grave destiny many of their kin would have suffered – if it were not for your conservation initiatives throughout the world. Therefore, on behalf of dragonflies and on our own behalf, the world community of dragonfly students presents you with this issue of Odonatologica, as a token of thanks for everything you have done, and are still doing, for the protection and conservation of their world. Your attention to morphological detail, as apparent from your early publications (1939, 1942), would seem to indicate a young potential taxonomist. But your life and interests took a different turn – and your research on odonate territoriality (1952a) was one of the highlights both of your studies and of the science of odonatology ofthat time. This is an absolutely classical publication, and a firm basis for most work in dragonfly ethology and population biology ever since. Various aspects of population biology have had your continuous attention. For the duration and precision of systematic recording, your studies in Woodwalton Fen (1991a, 2001a) will certainly remain unmatched in odonatological literature for a long time to come; the two publications represent an important reference for studies of community succession in the Northern Hemisphere.

Fellow of the Linnean Society and the British Dragonfly Society, Member of Honour of the Societas Intemationalis Odonatologica, Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society, etc. and founding chairman of the international group promoting Odon. conservation) is followed by his shortened bibliography (1939-2002; 135 titles, fairly complete for odonatological publications, but ca45 papers on pesticides and environment are omitted). – N.W.M. is a naturalist biologist whose lifelong aim has been to conserve wildlife and to relate the conservation of wildlife to human activities and welfare. In addition to his very wideranging contribution to conservation, he always maintained his long term research on odon. After retiring (1983), he created a reserve beside his garden, and dragonflies again took centre stage. Most of his odonatological work is devoted to studies on adult territorial behaviour, distribution and community structure, and to various aspects of habitat and species conservation.

N2  - During their patrolling flight 6 A. sieboldii responded to a rotating fan by hovering. The dragonflies did not respond to the playback sound of the fan. However, they did respond to the rotation of a mini desk fan which was observed through the window of a sound insulated box. The dragonflies responded to rotation of discs of various patterns, even when the ambient temperatures were low for summer; thus they did not respond due to thermoregulation. Only 6 <5 responded, and they did not respond to rotation of low velocity. — <J <J responded to a suspended S or 9 that was fluttering, but not when it was still. Therefore, it was concluded that the response to rotating objects by <5 <J might be regarded as behaviour to ascertain whether a rotating object is a 9 or not. The hovering rate (HVR) in relation to rotation velocity and colour patterns is discussed.

N2  - The reproductive morphology and behaviour of 6 and 9 at the northern edge of the sp. range, in Britain are described. Copula duration was relatively short and occurred in tussocks around the stream and oviposition usually occurred in tandem. Although there was no significant relationship between body size and clutch size, large clutches were only found in the largest individuals and larger 2 9 produced larger, and thus better-provisioned eggs. Examination of the dimensions of the aedeagus and the 9 sperm storage organs revealed that <J 6 could remove rival sperm from both the bursa copulatrix and spermatheca consistent with the presence of extensive proximally oriented microspination with sperm masses on the surface of the aedeagi. 9 9 store sperm from previous matings and a few partition clutches between consecutive oviposition episodes. The fulfilment of these ecological and behavioural pre-requisites and the predominance of mate guarding during oviposition suggests that sperm competition by sperm displacement is prevalent in this sp. and constitutes a substantial selection pressure.

N2  - The reproductive behaviour in relation to structural habitat resources was studied at mountain bogs of the Central Alps (Tyrol, Austria). The 3 â searched for mates at small clearings in coniferous forests where numerous scattered oviposition sites were hidden in dense vegetation, using 3 tactics: (1) they scanned the oviposition sites by slow flights at low height over large vegetated areas (scan flight), (2) they patrolled restricted areas with frequent hover stops while chasing any intruder (patrol flight), (3) they dived repeatedly into gaps of emergent vegetation, searching for 9 9 close to the water (dive flights). 62% of the 9 9 remained undiscovered by 63, 11% fled successfully and 27% accepted copulation (n = 139). The copulation was always initiated in the air or on the ground when both partners plunged into the vegetation following a clash. Immediately after the take off — and possibly after intramale sperm translocation — the tandem assumed the wheel position. The pairs often circled over the clearings for several minutes and perched on sunlit branches of spruce or pine trees, 0.8-12 m above ground (mean 2.75 m, n = 20). During copulation that lasted 31-150 min (mean 85 min, n = 14) rhythmic pumping movements of the 3 basal abdominal segments with frequencies from 0,14 to 0.36 Hz were observed. Copulation terminated by disengagement of the genitalia, then the partners separated immediately or after a short tandem flight. Oviposition never followed directly upon copulation and always occurred unguarded. The oviposition sites were selected carefully at shallow puddles among emergent vegetation. Eggs were laid by touching soaked moss or turf mud with the tip of the abdomen during rhythmic dipping flight movements with mean frequency of 0.61 Hz. One oviposition bout lasted 1-3 min and featured an egg flow of 1.7-4.5 eggs per s. Ovipositing females were sometimes successfully attacked by frogs (Rana temporaria), and males were occasionally found in orb-webs of spiders (Araneus sp.); however, predation risk was low at rendez-vous sites. Sperm competition is discussed with respect to behaviour during copulation and to the morphology of 3 and 9 genitalia.

N2  - The relationship between odon. and wetland quality was investigated in Brooks, from May until Sept. 1999. Sixteen study sites were each visited 7 times to survey adult dragonflies and aquatic macroinvertebrates, record environmental parameters, collect water samples, record vegetative characteristics, and assess beef cattle grazing influences. 25 odonate spp. were recorded, of which Ischnura verticalis is new to Alberta. A significant negative correlation was detected between cattle presence (measured as percent stems grazed surrounding the wetland) and odon, species richness (p = 0.022; r2 = 0.322), teneral species richness (p = 0.018; r = 0.337), and the Shannon-Weiner diversity indices (p = 0.060; r2 = 0.230) of the study sites. In addition, vegetation species richness and odon. species richness show a positive correlation (p = 0.066; f2 = 0.221). A logistic regression establishes that the absence of Coenagrion angulatum, Enallagma ebrium and Aeshna interrupta is associated with high cattle impacts, or low vegetation species richness. This study outlines the effect that cattle can have on wetland odon. species diversity and recommends that measures are taken to protect wetlands, while offering an incentive and reasonable cost/benefit ratio to both rangeland and wetland mangers.

N2  - A study of Lestes “virens” in Algeria, based on SEM, size analysis, and molecular analysis of nuclear ribosomal DNA genes (18S, 5.8S) and spacers (ITS1 and 2), reveals the presence of two taxa that can be separated by the length and sequence of their ITS 1 and their adult coloration, but not by molecular features in their 18S and 5.8S genes, the ITS2 spacer, and morphology. This contrasts with the Enallagma cyathigerum-group, where geographically defined morphological differences were unaccompanied by differences in ITS1 and ITS2. Previous ecological data had shown the first lestid to be a summer, and the second an autumnal reproducer. The red autumnal species is here named Lestes numidicus sp. n. (holotype <J, allotype 9; Algeria, Lac des Oiseaux, X-1993; deposited in IRSN, Brussels); the status of the green summer species is discussed. It probably corresponds to L. virens, but this is likely to be a hybrid taxon, resulting from the postglacial introgression of L. numidicus with a taxon invading from the East, via the Iberian Peninsula, L. virens vestalis from France is likely to be introgressed as well. In case this hypothesis is confirmed, the first junior synonym available, L. marikovskii (Belyshev) from Kazakhstan, applies to the taxon extending from Kazakhstan-Tajikistan to Central Europe.

N2  - The studies were conducted at Kutas canal near Artdnd, Hungary. In order to reveal whether there is any relationship between wing fluctuating asymmetry and mating success in mated (observed at least once in wheel position) and solitary 6 6 (not involved in pairing during the study period), 106 c? were marked and their wing length between arculus and pterostigma measured. Mated 6 6 had more symmetrical forewings, but in the case of hindwings there were no differences between solitary and mated individuals. The survival rate did not differ between the 2 groups and it was constant over time. The probability of recapture was higher in mated 6 6 and varied with time. The number of hours spent with observation did not explain the variation in the recapture rate.

N2  - Using light and electron microscopy, sperm packing has been studied in the large sperm bundles of an aeshnid dragonfly. Each large bundle is built up of variously-sized smaller bundles which probably reflects the intracyst formation procedure. It is proposed that initially there is a gathering of immature sperm cells into small bundles at several sites within the testicular cyst, and secondly all sperm heads are bundled together. This construction of subunits may be of importance to bundle break-down and release of individual sperm cells after transfer to the female reproductive organs.

N2  - The odonate species richness of the granitic islands of Seychelles, a biodiversity hotspot, is significantly correlated to island size. The larger islands also have the highest elevations and hence the most streams from cloud catching as well as from downpours. The Seychelles odon. fauna can be divided into 2 groups: (1) endemic spp„ and, (2) geographically-widespread eurytopic, vagile spp. The endemic spp. are elevational fugitives that need high-elevation forest cover, even if secondary. They are remarkably tolerant of temporary drying out of streams. In contrast, the widespread spp. occur at low elevations, are pool spp., and are tolerant of removal of forest cover. They emigrate when the pools dry out. Conservation of the endemic taxa depends on maintaining cloud-catching forest, although evidence suggests that their populations are maintained even where the forest is partly alien invasive trees or secondary regrowth.

N2  - The genitalia have a “design” remarkably similar to those of other representatives of the family. The main 5 structures are the bursa copulatrix, a T-shaped spermatheca, a pair of vaginal plates bearing a variable number of mechanoreceptive sensilla, and a ganglion located at the VIII abdominal segment. The 6 intromittent organ is a curved, sclerotised aedeagus that ends in a distal penis head. This latter structure bears 2 lateral appendages which are covered by recurved spines, A construction of the fertilisation and copulatory events is proposed based on descriptive and experimental evidence in other zygopterans as well as in this species. The female genital anatomy suggests fertilisation occurs in the manner proposed for other odonates. Experimental evidence shown in this work suggests that, during fertilisation, the egg stimulates the mechanoreceptive sensilla and elicits contractile activity of the muscles that surround the sperm storage organs (SSOs). The contractile activity is likely to be mediated by the VIII abdominal segment ganglion. As a consequence of the muscular contractions, the SSOs eject sperm which arrive to the site where the egg is and fertilise it. During copulation, the aedeagus “imitates” the presence of an egg in the vaginal plates and stimulates the mechanoreceptive sensilla inducing spermathecal sperm ejection. It is likely that spermathecal sperm is ejected to the bursa copulatrix where it is removed by the penis head and lateral appendages. After this sperm displacement process, the copulating male’s sperm, stored in the seminal vesicle, is transferred, through a canal-like passage, by the aedeagus to the SSOs, Since $ 5 exhibit a considerable intra- and inter-individual variation in sensillum distribution and number on the plates, it is discussed whether this may have an adaptive significance in terms of retaining more control over stored sperm for $ $ during <5 stimulation.

In another sp., size differences between morphs do exist but the genetic basis of the polymorphism has not been explored. In N. irene, 2 2 morphs exist: one is similar to the c? in both colour and pattern (the androchrome), whereas the other differs from the 6 (the more common gynochrome). No differences are shown in lengths of wing, femur or tarsus between androchromes and gynochromes, nor any differences in multivariate estimates of size or in wet mass corrected for these size estimates were found. The study controls for time of season, which is known to influence the size of emerging temperate damselflies. The results concur with results from other spp. where the genetic basis of colour polymorphism is known.

Davies (18 March 1923-2 March 2003), professional biochemist and immunologist, and one of the world’s leading odonatologists, is followed by his odonatological bibliography (1954-2003; 41 titles). Allen Davies sadly died on 2 March 2003, just a few days short of his 80lh birthday. He will be missed by his many friends in the odonatological world. He was one of those really talented people who seem to be successful in most things they do. He was a professional research biochemist who developed an interest in dragonflies primarily as an amateur, but as his career was drawing to a close, he effectively started a second professional life with the study of Odonata.

The agonistic behaviour repertoir of N. fraseri is contrasted with published information on coenagrionid larvae and with the behaviours of Diphlebia euphoeoides (Amphipterygidae; cf. OA 9165), a superficially similar larva occurring in the same habitat. The use of larval agonistic display characters in phylogenetic analysis is discussed.

N2  - The sexual behaviour and a case of male phenotypic dimorphism in P. quinta are described: black-winged (BW) 3 3 and hyaline-winged (HW) 3 3. Similar to other territorial odon. spp., some 3 3 defended a space that 9 9 used for oviposition while other 3 3 acted as satellites. Copulation took place in 2 stages which differed in abdominal movement orientation and duration. Copulation duration varied between morphs and was frequently disrupted. During disruption, the genitalia of both sexes disengaged although the tandem position (the 3's abdominal appendices grasping the 9's prothorax) was maintained. Disruptions, which took place during the first stage (a stage during which displacement of rival sperm occurs in most odon. spp.), were sometimes followed by emissions of sperm from the vagina. Male morphs exhibit striking behavioural differences; HW 3 3 do not defend territories, but BW 3 3 do, and the former copulate for longer and show more copulatory disruptions. Some stages of 9 behaviour are described and suggested as instances during which 9 9 may be exerting mate choice; 9 9 copulated on fewer occasions with HW 3 3, copulations with this morph were longer but ovipositions were not, and sperm emissions (possibly, sperm from previous mates) and copulatory disruptions of BW 3 3 were less frequent. Because of these differences, it is suggested this is a unique sp. to test current ideas of 9 control in an insect order in which the idea of 3 “control” has been traditional.

N2  - The ecological status of waterbodies situated in a Danubian floodplain section at Tulin (Lower Austria) was assessed by a dragonfly survey using the “Odonata Habitat Index” (OHI) approach suggested by CHOVANEC & WARINGER (2001, Regulated Riv. Res. Mngmt 17: 493-507). The investigation was carried out at 28 standing water bodies and 2 reference sites situated directly at the Danube. Stretches of 100 m shorelength were mapped and the “Representative Spectrum of Odonata Species” (SCHMIDT, 1985, Odonatologica 14; 127-133) was recorded. Only autochthonous spp. were used for the assessment procedure. A total of 11 Zygoptera and 20 Anisoptera spp. was recorded, 29 of them autochthonous. Site-specific Odonata Habitat Indices ranged from 1.72 to 3.67. The OHI of the only reference site where Odonata were detected directly at the Danube was 1.38. The mean OHI for the whole floodplain section was 2.79. These figures indicate a relatively high level of habitat diversity. By comparing this status quo with reference conditions derived from the overall habitat situation before the regulation and from old species inventories dating back to the I9"1 century, the status of the Tulin floodplain section was ranked as class II (“good ecological status”) in a 5-tiered classification scheme.

N2  - Studies of population genetics and phylogenetics require samples from individuals representing a variety of spp. and populations. Collecting the necessary individuals may be problematic, particularly for seasonal, rare, or geographically remote organisms. Museum collections therefore provide a potentially valuable resource, and the widespread use of polymerase chain reactions (PCR) means that target regions of DNA can be amplified from very small amounts of tissue. Here modifications to DNA extraction techniques are described that have allowed the authors to extract, amplify, and sequence a portion of mitochondrial DNA from parts of single dragonfly legs taken from museum specimens up to 80 yrs old. It is anticipated that in future these techniques will be applied to a range of odon. studies, including questions of conservation genetics.

Multivariate analyses distinguished between ‘neutral’ and ‘acid’ ponds. Low pH affected colonization by preventing the establishment of acid-intolerant immigrant spp., and by retarding succession.

N2  - By the use of light and electron microscopy, the micro-anatomy of the 6 genital ducts and the 9 reproductive organs have been surveyed. Sperm bundles transmitted from the testis through the vas deferens become embedded in a carrier jelly and also have additional substances bound to them; obviously the sperm cells are undergoing maturation. In the 2 2, sperm bundles in carrier jelly appear to be deposited in the vaginal canal and, particularly, in the receptaculum seminis, the latter serving for long-term conservation. It seems possible that agents emitted from the posterior accessory glands to the vaginal surface near the genital aperture diffuse forwards, reaching the receptacle entrance. Here they presumably induce a liquefaction of the jelly and break-down of sperm bundles, thus releasing individual sperm cells. Free sperm cells are expected to accumulate in the anterior accessory sacs which they leave during fertilization. The morphological changes taking place in the sperm after transfer to the 9 genital tract appear ambiguous.

N2  - Females were observed ovipositing, both alone and in tandem, in Chaves County, New Mexico, United States. The 9 oviposits by scooping water droplets into the air with the tip of her abdomen. This mode of oviposition is common in many Libellulinae, but this is the first report of a 9 using it in tandem as well as in solo oviposition. The 9 L. composita also grips the 6 abdomen with her legs during post-copulatory oviposition flight, a behavior previously reported only in subfamilies Trameinae and Zygonychinae. Possible functional significance of this flight behavior is discussed based on observations and analyses of the mechanics of the oviposition process that are evident in photographs.

The monthly abundance of H. rosea was estimated utilizing a scan method based on 49 fixed areas in 30-min intervals from 0800 to 1700 h during the day. The daily <3 activity pattern is characterized by a sharp increase at 0900 h with continuous density until 1430 h, followed by a sharp decrease after 1600 h. A correlation between peak densities was observed during the year and high period of photoperiod and low evapotranspiration suggesting possible ways S 6 can adjust their emergence periods to optimize water loss with longer reproduction periods of activities.

N2  - A short biography of Prof. Minter J. Westfall, Jr (28 Jan. 1916-20 July 2003), teacher, entomologist, and a leading odonatologist of his time, is presented. His odonatological bibliography post-1985 follows (1986-2000; 15 titles). An extremely sad moment befell the odonatological world this past summer, a moment that all those who study dragonflies were hoping would be postponed for a long time. Minter Jackson Westfall, Jr died peacefully at his home in Gainesville, Georgia on July 20,2003, at the age of 87. With Minter’s passing, a chapter in the history of odonatology is closed. He will be revered along with the likes of other great 20lh century odonatologists before him, such as Calvert, Walker, Williamson, Montgomery and Lieftinck, to name just a few. He touched the lives and careers of nearly all members of SIO (Societas Intemationalis Odonatologica), but his reach went to all comers of the globe as he corresponded with and assisted nearly the entire world dragonfly community; in short, he was a cornerstone and anchor for the science of odonatology. His strength faded only in the last couple of years. The last time most of us close to him greeted him was at Cades Cove, Tennessee, when at the age of 85 he came to help inventory the Odonata of the Smoky Mountains National Park. To say Minter was devoted to dragonfly study is an understatement, but he was even more devoted to his family and his Christian faith. He is survived by his son David, daughters Carol and Holly, and numerous grandchildren and great grandchildren. I speak for all of SIO in offering condolences to each of them.

Stroenie, funkcionirovanie i evoluciya krylovyh sochleneniy nasekomyh. — Structure, functioning and evolution of the wing articulations in insects, Chteniya Pamyati N.A. Holodkovskogo 41: 3-47. (Russ., with Engl. s.). — (Last known address; Dept Ent., St Petersburg St. Univ., Universitetskaya nab. 7/9, RUS-199164 St Petersburg). The structure and functioning of the wing axillary sclerites during wing beating and wing folding are described and illustrated. In the course of evolution the structure of the articulation zone of the wing has changed significantly, allowing new movements and new interconnections between axillary sclerites. A comparative account of the structure and functioning of the axillae is presented and some of the evolutionary trends are shown. Among these, the optimization of transmission of the effort from flight muscles to the wing is most important. A mechanism for wing folding is described and the sequence of changes in the course of the evolution is Paced. Of all groups studied, the most primitive type of the wing axillary zone is found in Plecoptera. 2 distinctive stems may be derived from the ground-plan for Insecta: (1) Gryllones (without Plecoptera), and (2) Scarabaeiformes and Cimiciformes (without Palaeodictyopteroidea). The peculiarity of construction of the axillary zone in Ephemeroptera, Odon. and Palaeodictiopteroidea is very high and testify to their early separation (together or separately) from Insecta common stem. All these 3 groups seem adopted to benefit liom gliding flight. – See also OA 8527. (14801) GRIESINGER, J„ 1988.

N2  - In this study, a 10-month survey of four aquatic sites in Kibale National Park, Uganda was used to quantify seasonal and spatial variation in both limnological features of the sites and adult damselfly assemblage structure. Of the 4 limnological characters measured dissolved oxygen was the most variable among sites, ranging from an average of 1.01 mg I1 in the interior of the Rwembaita Swamp (a papyrus-dominated wetland) to 6.71 mg I’1 in an inflowing tributary of the swamp. Species richness was similar among sites and did not correlate with dissolved oxygen concentration. However, site was a significant predictor of occurrence for some spp. This suggests that site effects are important, and that a combination of site-specific environmental characters may underlie the observed distributional patterns. Seasonal fluctuation in rainfall was not a good predictor of Zygoptera activity. Several spp. were active in both the wet and dry seasons. Surprisingly, adult Proischnura subfurcatum were detected year-round in the hypoxic waters of the Rwembaita (papyrus) Swamp and did not occur at any other sites in the larval or adult phase, suggesting that this sp. is a swamp specialist.

Sympatric Calopteryx spp. usually differ conspicuously in pigmentation (colour, transparency, darkness) of their wings. 9 9 C. haemorrhoidalis differ from all other European spp. by the presence of a dark distal zone in the hindwings. – The relative value of various (manipulated) sets of 9 wings for elicitation of cj courtship was assessed using choice experiments. C. haemorrhoidalis 3 3 did not court wingless $ 9 of their own sp. nor did they court conspecific 9 9 with wings of the sympatric C. xanthostoma. However, the presence of a single wing of a conspecific 9 was sufficient to elicit courtship behaviour. Choices between 2 9 models (presented simultaneously to territorial male individuals) revealed that the presence of a contrasting dark zone was an important distinguishing characteristic, whereas too high a transparency (a single wing as opposed to a set of 2 or 4 wings pressed against each other) greatly diminished the value of a model. The need for the presence of a dark zone will be effective in precluding courtship of 9 9 of other sympatric spp. The need for sufficiently low transparency will put a check on courtship attempts of immature 9 9.

N2  - The Castel Porziano estate is a well preserved coastal Mediterranean woodland, rich in still bodies of water, where odonatological studies have been taking place since the ’50s. Adult Odon. were recorded for the entire estate in 1997 and 1998 (March-Nov.; 2 checks each month). 1,838 adults (22 spp.) were marked, to assess their movements. The results showed that in 1997-1998 a total of 31 spp. were present. This number is very close to the number (29) recorded up to 1976. Variation in species assemblage in 16 ponds was observed from 1997 to 1998. Although the overall species similarity was preserved, the number of spp. for each pond and the number of ponds inhabited by each sp. significantly increased from 1997 to 1998. In regard to the adult movements, 251 marked individuals of 13 spp. were re-sighted only at the same ponds where they had been marked and 30 individuals of 6 spp. were sighted at different ponds. Among the latter, the majority moved within a range of a few hundred metres, but some individuals were able to fly quite far, e.g. 2.7 km (Coenagrion puella) and 5.8 km (Libellula depressa). It is concluded that the assemblage variation for the entire estate was small, varying more on a decennial than on an annual scale, but for a single pond variation is wider on both time scales. The quick recolonization among ponds, due to the adult’s movements, appears to be the cause of greater stability at mesoscale rather than at local scale.

N2  - The mark-and-recapture method was used to study the population parameters of sexually mature adult S. infuscatum in a forest-paddy field complex in the cool temperate zone of Japan. After emergence, they moved into the forest gaps, and they remained and fed exclusively in the forest gaps throughout their lives. Mature 6 3 captured outnumbered mature 5 9 on each sampling day in the paddy fields, but not in the gaps. However, the estimated daily numbers in both habitats and/or the whole survey area roughly indicated a 1:1 sex ratio, The estimated daily survival rates and daily immigrations showed that 9 9 were apt to stay in the forests, while 3 3 sometimes dispersed, though 9 9 in the paddy fields tended to have a long-range flight. In the morning, some of the paired couples flew to the paddy fields in tandem and oviposited on the wing; these were so-called flyers. The rest remained in the forests the entire day; these were designated as perchers. The forest gaps were thus important for the life cycle of this species both as feeding and roosting sites.

N2  - The ribosomal DNA genes (I8S, 5.8S) and internal transcribed spacers (ITS1, ITS2) of 5 representatives of1 “Cercion” r occurring in East Asia were examined and compared with west-palaearctic' “Cercion” lindenii, Erythromma najas • (2 populations), E. viridulum, some true Coenagrion species, and with Enallagma and Ischnura as outgroups. The molecular phylogenetic tree confirms the position of H. Heidemann & R. Seidenbusch (1993, Die Ubellenlarven Deutschlands und Frankreichs, Bauer, Keltem) that Cercion lindenii belongs in Erythromma, and consequently, the binomen Erythromma lindenii is accepted. Regarding the “oriental” group for which, under the new situation, the name Cercion is no longer available, the genus name Paracercion gen. n. is introduced. This is supported by molecular evidence and by some morphological traits. A morphological basis for setting apart the new genus from Erythromma is thus achieved, but its delimitation from Coenagrion remains to be defined.

N2  - An analysis of a large series of specimens from Eurasia showed a strong morphological variability. It is of an individual, modificatory, or clinal nature, rather than a geographical one. Thus, 2 continental sspp., S. p. intermedium Belyshev, 1955 and S. p. kurentzovi Belyshev, 1956, should be suppressed as they cannot be defined by any taxonomically significant differences. The insular subspecies, S. p. elatum, inhabiting Sakhalin, the Kurile and the Japanese islands, however, can be separated. It is concluded that S. pedemontanum has only 2 sspp.: continental S. p. pedemontanum and the insular S. p. datum.

N2  - Sperm, transmitted to the 2 as individual filamentous cells suspended in a liquid medium, are discharged into a thick-walled pouch, the receptaculum seminis, on the dorsum of the vaginal canal. Spermatozoa soon appear concentrated in a single, smaller, pear-shaped accessory sac, the spermatheca, attached to the receptaculum-vagina junction. Particular cells in the wall of the accessory sac secrete a material that is thought to be added to the sperm concentrate. The purpose of the accessory sac is to serve as a store of spermatozoa for use in fertilization. A pair of posterior accessory glands has each an efferent duct that opens into the distal region of the vaginal canal; these ducts are provided with an elaborate muscular apparatus probably serving as a pump; in fresh material, efferently directed peristaltic waves have been observed. The glands are presumed to contribute to the investment of the eggs. The apical domains of the glandular epithelial cells contain intraplasmic assemblages of multiplicating bacteroids. They are likely to be transferred to the ooplasm and thereby transmitted to a new generation.

N2  - During copulation, C. haemorrhoidalis S S displace the sperm of rivals stored by the 2. During displacement, sperm stored in 2 spermathecae are ejected by the 2 as a consequence of S genitalic stimulation: the aedeagus distorts 2 vaginal plates in which mechanoreceptive sensilla are embedded. The sensilla control spermathecal sperm release and a wider aedeagus displaces more sperm. There is variation between 9 2 in their sensillum number which might also affect sperm displacement rate. The role of sensillum number and aedeagal width in sperm displacement variation in copulations whose duration was controlled was investigated. Results indicated that only aedeagal width could predict sperm displacement variation. The neural communication between the vaginal plates and both spermathecae was also examined. Previous observations suggested a “lateral” control of sperm ejection between each vaginal plate and its corresponding spermatheca. This was corroborated by stimulating the mechanoreceptive sensilla of 2 2 that underwent different surgical treatments: only those 2 9 whose vaginal plate nerves were cut, showed no volumetric decline in sperm in the corresponding spermatheca. Finally, the effect of copula duration (number of aedeagal copulatory movements) on sperm ejection was experimentally examined. In natural conditions, $ 6 perform approximately 50 aedeagal movements during copulation. There was no difference in sperm volumes between the pairs of 2 2 that were subjected to 50 and 80 aedeagal movements of stimulation using the same aedeagus. These results help to understand the nature of the spermathecal sperm displacement mechanism in this sp.

N2  - The behaviour of <J Coenagrion puella and Xanthocnemis zealandica towards conspecific andromorph and gynomorph 9 9 was studied at breeding ponds in the U.K. and in New Zealand respectively. As expected, <J attention directed towards copulation wheels (C. puella) did not depend on whether the wheel contained an andromorph or a gynomorph. Similarly, 6 attention directed towards tandem pairs (C. puella and X. zealandica) did not depend on whether the tandem contained an andromorph or a gynomorph. When individual andromorph and gynomorph 9 $ (C puella and X. zealandica) were released at the water’s edge they experienced similar levels of attention from 3 3. By contrast, 3 3 (. X. zealandica) formed significantly more tandems with gynomorphs tethered at the water’s edge than with tethered andromorphs. The observations suggest that 3 3 readily identify and intercept conspecific 9 5 at the water’s edge, particularly when in motion, and that andromorphs and gynomorphs are equally susceptible to 3 attention. Behaviour of 3 6 towards tethered $ $ may be atypical compared to that recorded under more natural conditions.

N2  - In L. virens, the tandem post-copulatory guarding varies from some minutes to more than 4 hours and appears correlated to the time of the day and disturbance by unpaired <J 6. Using a multiple regression analysis, with guarding duration as the dependent variable and time of day, temperature and disturbance as the independent variables, it is shown that only disturbance significantly explains the model. An experimental test, in which early-occurring tandem males were not disturbed, while late-occurring ones were disturbed (a reverse situation of what happens in the field), showed that the latter kept their ovipositing 9 9 for significantly longer times than the former. The capability of 6 6 of varying guarding duration accordingly to the density of solitary 6 6 allows them to invest more or less time for guarding, according to the actual risk of losing sperm precedence.

N2  - Shifts between perching sites, the flying behaviour as well as reproductive behaviour of adults were observed. All marked individuals inhabiting the dense reed community floor were followed from sunrise to sunset. Simultaneous observation was carried out by approximately 20 researchers. Every adult, sexually immature and mature, perched at 20 cm above the water surface within the reed community. For immature adults, about 120 flight activities were performed per day. The accumulated length of the movement was 9 m per day. When matured, the number of flight activities increased two-fold and the total length of the movement was 27 m per day. Although this sp. is a percher, showing little movement, increased flight activity by mature individuals caused encounters between individuals, hovering face-to-face. Few tandem flights were observed and $ 5 oviposited alone. The behaviour traits of this sp. at low light intensity are discussed.

N2  - DrXIUFU ZHAO, known from his publications and correspondence as HSIU-FU CHAO, a renowned entomologist and the Doyen of Chinese odonatology, died of a heart attack on 2nd May 2001 at Fujian province, P.R. China, at the age of 85. Dr Xiufu Zhao was bom at Fuzhou, Fujian province on 17 May 1917. He showed great interest in observing nature already while he was a child. He studied at Fuzhou Scientific and Technology Middle School, where the well-known biologist Zhongzhang Tang gave lectures on biology during the period Zhao attended this school. Guided by Tang, he soon began studying biology. He passed entrance examinations for both Qinghua University and Yenjing University in 1935. Following the advice of his brother, Xiuqian Zhao, he chose to attend the latter. At Yenjing he studied under the guidance of the celebrated biologist Jingfii Hu. An insect catching boy during childhood, now a junior in a university he started investigating injurious insects of fruit trees. He commenced a study on parasitic wasps with great interest and soon made original discoveries. Seeing that he was interested in zootaxonomy, Professor Wu sent him a copy ofJ.G. Needham's Manual of the dragonflies of China, in order to introduce him to the realm of zootaxonomy. As a result, Zhao entered this domain with great enthusiasm. He was admitted as an honorary member of the “Beta Beta Beta Learned Society" in recognition of the excellence of his studies. He was also awarded a ‘Golden Key’ for the first time in his life.

N2  - Eight species occurring in Japan and continental East Asia are separated by the morphology of their 6 terminalia and by the structure of the 5 pronotum and adjacent laminae mesostigmales. Paracercion barbatum is confirmed as a good species, probably restricted to China, where it co-occurs with P. impar and other spp. The continental East Asian P. v-nigrum is suggested to share a common ancestor with the Japanese P. sieboldii. On chorological grounds, the latter should not exist in Taiwan. Both sexes of all spp. are keyed.

N2  - Based on literature records and the examination of an extensive Odonata collection made in Fujian in 1930-1940’s (now in RMNH, Leiden), 21 spp. of Caloptera (Calopterygoidea) are recognized as occurring in Fujian province in eastern China. The Fujian Caloptera material (ca 860 specimens of 18 species) in RMNH is enumerated. The following taxonomic decisions are presented: Caliphaea nitens Navas, 1934 is removed from synonymy with Bayadera melanopteryx Ris, 1912 [!] and ranked as a valid species, distinct from C. consimilis McLachlan, 1894. The lectotype of Vestalis smaragdina Selys, 1879 is designated. Vestalis velata Ris, 1912 (syn. V. virens Needham, 1930) is ranked as a good species, while the “hyaline winged form of V. smaragdina velata” (sensu Asahina, 1977) is described as a new sp. Vestalis venusta sp. n. Bayadera continentalis Asahina, 1973 from Fujian and B. ishigakiana Asahina, 1964 from the Ryukyus are treated as full sp. and not as ssp. of B. brevicauda Fraser, 1928 from Taiwan. Bayadera melania Navas, 1934 is synonymized with B. melanopteryx Ris, 1912. Some preliminary taxonomic comments (to be discussed in detail elsewhere) are presented: Calopteryx grandaeva Selys, 1853 is a probable synonym of C. atrata Selys, 1853, whereas ( C. atrocyana (Fraser, 1935) is a good sp. Matrona basilaris Selys, 1853 and , M. nigripectus Selys, 1879 appear to be distinct sp. Mnais tenuis Oguma, 1913 and M. andersoni McLachlan in Selys, 1873 are also better treated as separate sp. Faunistic notes include: Libellago lineata (Burmeister, 1839) is recorded from Fujian province for the first time. Old records of Psolodesmus mandarinus McLachlan, 1870 and Euphaea compar McLachlan, 1870 (synonym of E. formosa Hagen in Selys, 1869) from Amoy Island near the Fujian coast are considered doubtful.

N2  - Much variation occurs in morphology and colouration among individuals of Japanese Mnais spp. It has been noted that 2 groups of Mnais often cohabit a stream in western Japan. There is, however, no clear morphological difference in 6 appendages and penis between the 2 groups, and this makes it difficult to determine their taxonomic status. In this study, to clarify the relationships between the sympatric species on both small (along a stream) and large (across Japan) geographic scales, sequences of the internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1 and 2) of nuclear ribosoraal DNA are compared. Base substitutions occurred at 4 sites of223 bps of the ITS 1 region, and by their combinations, the four sequence types could be distinguished among a total of 800 individuals. In the ITS2 region (total 411 bps including 5.8S rRNA region), all examined individuals had the same sequence. The geographical distribution of each ITS 1 sequence type and morphological data of wings and a pterostigma suggest that Japanese Mnais includes 2 distinct spp., M. strigata Selys, 1853 and M. costalis Selys, 1869. Their distribution ranges overlap widely in western Japan, where M. strigata is usually found at smaller and upper streams than M. costalis.

On the basis of this information it is suggested that Austroepigomphus and Zephyrogomphus should be elevated to generic rank, that Pleiogomphus should keep its position as a subgenus of Austrogomphus, and that Xerogomphus should be regarded as a subgenus of Austroepigomphus. Some morphological details of the previously undescribed male of what is now Zephyrogomphus longipositor (Watson) are given.

N2  - (15179) CATLING, P.M., 2001. Decline of Gomphus f. fratemus (Odonata: Gomphidae) in Lake Erie. Great Lakes Ent. 34(1): 1-7. – (2326 Scrivens Dr., R.R. 3, Metcalfe, ON, KOA 2PO, CA). Collections and literature reports indicate that the sp. was abundant on the shoreline prior to 1960. The 1999 and 2000 surveys did not result in any observations. It is concluded that the sp. has declined substantially and is possibly extirpated from the lake. The decline appears to have occurred between 1950 and I960, and thus approximates the mid-1950 decline of burrowing mayflies, which has been associated with warm weather oxygen depletion and pollution. It is likely that the causes of G. fratemus decline include climatic warming, pollution, changes to the shoreline, other effects of shoreline development and introduced spp. (15180) DAS, A., 2001.

N2  - Literature and personal information on the distribution of I. hastata and other odon. spp. in the Azores is reported. /. hastata and I. pumilio are recorded for the first time from the islands of Corvo and Sao Jorge, respectively. I. hastata appears the most common and abundant sp. and its population is formed by only 9 9 (no 6 S were ever recorded). The asexual reproduction of these populations was demonstrated by means of laboratory rearing during several generations. The dispersal ability of this sp. and the possible origin of parthenogenesis after its colonisation of the Azores are briefly discussed. The possible causes of threat are identified and the need for conservation measures is outlined.

N2  - Many Phyllomacromia spp. appear to be more variable than was hitherto realised. This has lead to the description of paler and darker forms as distinct spp. Fortunately, the genus is rich in morphological characters in both sexes, P. melania and P. overlaeti were described from $ 5 and both have been allied with non-conspecific 3 3, leading to great confusion. P. melania is the $ of the sp. known as P. fimicularia rather than that of P. contumax, while P. overlaeti matches P. subtropicalis and not P. schoutedeni. With the identity of these $ ? clarified and the variation considered, many synonyms arise; P. funicularia, P. bredoi and P. martorelli are synonyms of P. melania; P. biflava, P. nyanzana, P. reginae, P. halei and P. leoni of P. contumax; P. onerata and P. clymene of P. monoceros; and P. subtropicalis, P. paludosa and P. royi of P. overlaeti. P. paludis is not synonymous with P. contumax but with P. paula. The taxonomy of this large genus is briefly discussed and a new species grouping is proposed.

N2  - The microdistribution of 4 lotic spp. was investigated in the field. Microhabitat selection of Calopteryx splendens and Erythromma najas was further examined in the laboratory, individually at different larval densities and in the presence of the other species and a predator. — E. najas, Ischnura elegans and Platycnemis pennipes showed significant preferences for particular aquatic macrophytes compared to others in the field, whereas C. splendens did not discriminate between the investigated plant species. Only limited spatial separation was apparent between the larvae of different species, as preferences for the same macrophyte species were found. — When kept separate and at low densities, larvae of C. splendens and E. najas inhabited significantly different microhabitats in the laboratory. At high intraspecific abundances, spatial overlap between the two species became apparent as both increasingly occupied less preferred substrata, which is in concurrence with the ideal free distribution model of habitat selection. E. najas splendens at high densities. – In this instance, intraspecific competition therefore appeared to be more important than interspecific competition with other Zygoptera in determining the microdistribution of E. najas. In the field, the niches of the two species may be more adequately separated on the basis of prey selection or hunting behaviour. E. najas also actively reacted to the presence of a predator, indicating some flexibility of response regarding perch selection.

N2  - Knowledge of naturally occurring andromorph and gynomorph frequencies in populations of coenagrionid damselflies is important for understanding the evolution of 2 -limited polymorphism. Here are reported the frequencies of andromorphs and gynomorphs in populations of Coenagrion paella, C. mercuriale, Xanthocnemis zealandica and Ischnura uviatilis and a review is presented of the literature for other coenagrionid spp. It is shown that ratios of andromorphs to gynomorphs are often unequal with andromorphs generally being the uncommon morph. Significant inter- and intra-population variation in morph frequency sometimes occurs but is of low magnitude. No evidence was found for spatial segregation of andromorphs and gynomorphs. Andromorph frequency could not be significantly related with sex ratio or 6 density.

N2  - The micro-anatomy of the $ accessory glands in adult A. juncea and A. grandis is similar but the size of the A. grandis glands is clearly larger than that of A. juncea. The secretory cells constitute a simple columnar epithelium surrounding a cuticle-lined lumen. The glandular epithelium is provided with a peculiar system of deep, narrow, intercellular crypts bordered with microvillar cell membranes. Lipids released to the crypt lumen are presumably forced into the central gland lumen by contractions of the muscular network attached to the outside of the gland. The efferent duct of each gland that opens to the distal part of the vagina has a complicated muscular apparatus, probably serving as a pump. The secreted substances accumulate in the central gland cavity mainly during the pre-reproductive phase, which the dragonflies spend away from water. The secretion contains substances with wax-like properties and becomes darkened by osmication. Secretory cells appear to possess a limited life span; scattered cells in process of dying occur already during the early reproductive phase. In the late reproductive phase most of the glandular epithelium presents a disintegrated appearance. There is no cell renewal in the gland in the course of adult life. The pattern of cell death indicates a decomposition by apoptosis. Besides contributing to investment of the eggs, the glands presumably intervene also in other aspects of the reproductive processes.

N2  - Live mass was recorded for over 290 adult Odon. during peak flight season in Mississippi. Total live mass is reported for 19 spp., along with a quantitative species subset analysis of inter- and intraspecific sex partitioned mass. Fresh mass was significantly correlated with species and sex in Anisoptera (p = 0.021) and Zygoptera (p = 0.001), based on separate species-level analyses of the Libellulidae (n = 6 spp.) and Coenagrionidae (n = 4 spp.), respectively. Total live mass also was correlated with total body length in the libellulid dragonflies (r2 = 0.59-0.94, p<0.0001-0.03) and length-mass slopes were not significantly different among species. Limitations and cautions of mass prediction via proportionate size dimension(s) are discussed, some advantages of working with adults as opposed to larvae and measuring fresh mass as opposed to dry mass are described, and further study of length-mass relationships in adult Odon. is encouraged.

N2  - Odon. are usually infected with intestinal gregarines. Using E. praevarum adults, it was investigated whether: (a) both sexes differed in the degree of parasitism and immune ability (as shown by melanization of artificial, nylon-based implants in the thoracic region); and, (b) gamete production, survival and fat reserves correlated with gregarine burden. 2 sets of in-copula (to control for age) animals were used. One was used for estimation of egg and sperm, and the other for fat reserves. Survival was monitored as the time that field-captured insects survived under laboratory conditions in the absence of food. Gregarines were counted by dissection of the gut. Despite the case that 9 9 had more parasites than 3 3, both sexes did not differ in immune ability. Eggs, but neither sperm nor fat reserves in both sexes, correlated negatively with parasite number. Survival in both sexes also correlated inversely with gregarine burden. This, however, held only for 3 3 when the analysis was performed by sex. These results are discussed in terms of the detrimental effects of gregarine on Zygoptera hosts.

N2  - All knowledge of the odon. fauna of Kamchatka Peninsula (NE Asia) is reviewed, using literature data, miscellaneous collections and the results of an expedition by the authors in July 2003. In total, 27 spp. have become known, with Lestes dryas, Coenagrion hastulatum, Aeshna serrata, Epitheca bimaculata, Somatochlora exuberata, S. alpestris, and Leucorrhinia intermedia here reported for the first time. Aeshna palmata is dismissed; Anax junius, twice reported in the 19th century, is an American migrant that rarely reaches Kamchatka; the southern migrants, Pantala flavescens and Sympetrum frequens, are represented by one old record each, with specimens still preserved in Zool. Inst., St Petersburg. Very few more spp. may be expected in future, and it is concluded that the fauna is of an impoverished boreal extraction. This lack of endemism is understandable, since dragonflies could only begin reinvading the peninsula around 13,000 BP. 7 spp. are Holarctic, 1 is SE Palaearctic, 5 are NE Palaearctic, 1 is an American vagrant, 1 is a sub-cosmopolitan migrant, and the remainder are transpalaearctic.

N2  - The trade off between foraging and predator avoidance was studied. In the presence of a larva of the predatory Aeshna juncea, R nymphula was found to reduce foraging activity significantly. P. nymphula reduced foraging activity in response to chemical stimuli from A. juncea but not in response to visual stimuli. Foraging activity was further reduced when the diet of A. juncea was changed from chironomid larvae to P. nymphula. This suggests that predators are detected chemically and are chemically labelled by their diet. Foraging activity was found to increase with starvation level after 48 h without access to food, with a further increase after 72 h of starvation. The presence of chemical stimuli from conspecific fed predators delayed the increase in foraging activity until 72 h of starvation. These results have implications for larval survival and adult reproductive fitness.

N2  - P. lucia is a widespread African sp. with a checkered taxonomic history. Currently 2 ‘forms’ or subspecies, P. l. lucia and P. l. portia are recognized, although debate over the taxonomic status of these taxa has hardly let up over the last 230 years. The 2 ‘forms’ show distinctive wing pattern differences although other aspects of their morphology are very similar. They can occur highly sympatrically at some localities in southern Africa, as well as elsewhere, thus raising the question of whether they are two species or one perhaps with balanced polymorphism. DNA sequence data from the ITS2 and COI genes were collected from specimens of both these ‘forms’ to assess more rigorously the taxonomic status of these taxa. The closely related P. deceptor (Calv.) and P. jucunda (Ramb.) were included in the data set to provide a baseline for comparisons. Specimens from all 4 taxa were from pools of the flood plain of the Sabie R., Kruger National Park, South Africa, and were potentially able to interbreed. Both phylogenetic analyses and comparisons of sequence divergence levels strongly support the hypothesis that the 2 ‘forms’ of P. lucia are reproductively isolated and should be accorded full species status as P. lucia (Drury, 1773) and P. portia (Drury, 1773).

N2  - Genetic analyses are widely used for a variety of ecological research scenarios, especially to aid species’ conservation programs. Where genetic material is required from rare or endangered spp. it is essential that the samples be collected non-destructively, the ultimate goal should be to develop reliable DNA extraction protocols that may be used with non-invasively collected samples. In this paper 3 methods of DNA extraction (DNeasy tissue kit, proteinase-K/TNES and Chelex-100) that use odonate (Coenagrion mercuriale) exuviae as a non-invasive source of genetic material are described and compared. DNA extracted from exuviae produced consistent genotypes at 5 polymorphic microsatellite loci for all of the samples processed using the DNeasy tissue kit and proteinase-K/TNES methods and 4 out of the 6 exuviae treated with Chelex-100. Exuviae offer an effective source of genetic material from endangered odonates and also highly mobile spp. that are too difficult to catch in significant numbers. As such, it is expected DNA extracted from exuviae to be widely applied to odonatological genetic research.

Kirtlandia 27:1-17. – (Formerly at Dept Geol.Sci., Cleveland St. Univ., USA; current address unknown). 2 recolonization studies were performed (9 July-13 Aug., 13 Aug.-6 Sept.) by planting invertebrate-free sedimentary “islands” in the river substratum and then collecting them at set intervals. The odon. were represented on the undisturbed sedimentary bottom by “Clithemis” [= Celithemis?] larvae, which invariably appeared on the islands by the 5th week in the first study and by the 24th day in the second study. Drift was likely an important source of organisms in the early stages of recolonization, but the taxonomic composition of the sedimentary islands was not entirely predicted by the total composition of the drift fauna.

N2  - It has been reported that the response to rotating objects by A. sieboldii S 6 indicates recognition of the objects as $ 9. The influences of colour, size and rotation velocity (RV) of discs on hovering ratio (HVR) were studied with experiments using a small electric rotating device. Among the rotating discs with white, yellow, orange, red, green, or blue alternating with black, the one with green elicited the highest HVR (98%), whereas the HVR to the yellow/black disc was lowest (32%). This suggests that yellow has a role as a warning coloration against predators rather than being involved in intraspecific recognition. – In the relationship of the HVR to RV of the grecn/black disc, the HVR reached a peak around 20-25 Hz. In relation of HVR to the size of the disc, the larger the diameter of the disc, the higher was the HVR, and when different sizes of discs were put side by side, A. sieboldii 3 3 had a tendency to respond to the larger disc of the pair.

N2  - Macromia amphigena, Shaogomphus postocularis, and Sympetrum croceolum, ranging in NE China, Korea and Japan, have isolates at the NE margins of the Altai-Sayan mountain system: all 3 in SE West Siberia, M. amphigena and S. postocularis also in southern Central Siberia and M. amphigena in E Kazakhstan and W Mongolia. Ophiogomphus obscurus, Nihonogomphus ruptus, and Calopteryx japonica have continuous ranges protruding to the West from E. Asia to the Ob’ River basin and to 60° N latitude. Coenagrion ecornutum has a similar range but extends N in Siberia to 65° N and has an isolate in the S Ural Mts. C. lanceolatum, C. hylas and Somatochlora graeseri reach 70° N and also extend westward to the Ob’ River basin, but C. hylas has isolates in the Polar Urals and Bavaria, while S. graeseri is probably isolated in the Ural Mts. Of 4 other eastern spp. in Siberia, 2 reach 70° N, but Somatochlora exuberata extends westwards only to the sources of the Yenisey River and Coenagrion glaciale to Lake Baikal, while Cercion v-nigrum and Anisogomphus maacki just penetrate into SE Transbaikalia. Thus, 11 eastern odon. spp. have their western limits in Siberia (defined in a narrow sense, not including the Far East), In addition, 4 have more westerly isolates, 3 in the Urals and 1 in Bavaria. Siberia also includes the eastern limits of 21 western spp. 24 transpalaearctic spp. spread far to the N and 10 spp. occupy S Siberia only (or just occur locally), 2 Central Asian spp. barely penetrate into S. Siberia. Aeshna viridis is a doubtful amphipalaearctic species. Numerous palaeopalinological reconstructions suggest that during the Holocene climatic optimum, a continuous belt of broad-leaved forest was restored in Siberia, providing conditions for a recolonization of Siberia by Odon. Westward migrations of eastern spp. were favoured by the optimum occurring earlier in the east than in the west. Hence, many western spp. had no time to occupy all of Siberia and today the eastern limits of their ranges lie within the region. M. amphigena, S. postocularis and S. croceolum perhaps were the most stenotopic of those E. Asian spp. that colonized Siberia during the Holocene, and after the optimum, their ranges shrank to the peri-Altaian refugium. Their isolates there should be dated no earlier than 5-6 thousand yrs ago. C. v-nigrum and A. maacki are perhaps the least mobile of the eastern spp in Siberia.

N2  - Larval Zygoptera and Anisoptera were sampled at 3 lakes. Environmental variables such as chemical composition, water current, turbidity, and vegetation cover were measured. Cross Lake had the most spp. and greater diversity of spp. than Chaplin’s and Sibley lakes. Most Zygoptera spp. were found at Cross Lake where carbon availability was highest. Classification and ordination analysis produced similar species groups, providing strong evidence for species assemblages being determined by the measured environmental variables. Tolerant spp. included Enallagma civile, Erythemis simplicicollis and Plathemis lydia. Spp. only present at Cross Lake (incl. Argia sedula, Enallagma basidens, Ischnura hastata, I. kellicotti, Celithemis eponina, Libellula luctuosa. Erpetogomphus designatus, L. pulchella, Nasiaeschna pentacantha) were associated with lower levels of ammonia, conductivity, pH, and higher levels of oxygen and increased vegetation. Cross Lake provided habitat that could support more spp. and was important for spp. that were less tolerant of ammonia and anoxia. This study provides baseline data for future monitoring and conservation management of these lakes.

N2  - The thoracic temperature of adults in a forest-paddy field complex in the cool temperate zone of Japan was measured. After emergence, individuals moved into the forest gaps, where all sexually immature adults remained on perches. Both 6 6 and 9 9 controlled their thoracic temperatures against a radiant heat load in a similar manner. After maturation, some of the individuals were seen to fly in tandem over the rice paddy fields under direct sunlight for oviposition. This study evaluated the impact of the thermal environment on the perching behaviour in the forest gaps and flying behaviour in tandem in the rice paddy fields. Mean thoracic temperatures of adults were consistently higher than ambient temperatures. The difference between the high thoracic and low ambient temperature was lower among flying individuals in the rice paddy fields than in perching individuals living in the forest gaps. The control of thoracic temperature in response to ambient and radiant temperature in perching mature adults was similar to that in immature adults. In the rice paddy fields, the flying in tandem resulted in a smaller difference between thoracic over radiation temperature in females than in males in tandem. The high degree of thermoregulation clearly allowed mature adults to be active under direct sunlight. The role of perching in the forest gaps is discussed with regard to thermoregulation.

N2  - A hydrobiological survey of scarce permanent aquatic environments in the Ennedi and Ounianga regions of northern Chad yielded a small collection of 7 odon. spp. It adds 3 new spp. to the known fauna of Chad: Ischnura senegalensis, Pseudagrion hamoni, and Orthetrum sabina. The presence of O. sabina at Ounianga represents the westernmost record of this oriental sp. in N. Africa. Another oriental element, O. taeniolatum, may not exist in Africa W. of the Nile, possibly being replaced there by the closely related O. kollmannspergeri Buchholz. The 44 spp. hitherto reported from the Republic of Chad likely represent only a third or less of those to be expected in the country.

The infestation of the dragonfly by the mite was monitored throughout the emergence period. On 3 (out of 18) days, the $ $ were significantly more parasitised than 3 6. Based on the intensity of ectoparasite infestation, its influence on the dragonfly population dynamics is assessed. With the data gathered, a simple model could be constructed that simulates the success of the return of mites to the reproduction habitat, depending on the life history of the host.

N2  - Based on all available data, the former and present distribution in Europe is presented and critically analysed. The sp. is extinct or has only survived at single or small clustered and isolated localities in many parts of the western borderlands of its former Eurasian area that extended from Belgium to Japan. It is continuously declining, especially W and S of the line running through the Baltic States, N and E Poland and S Belarus. The attached basic data from Asia reveal incomplete knowledge, but probably indicate a better situation in the eastern part of the range. The main aspects of the ecology and biology are outlined and discussed. Special attention is paid to the elements helpful in understanding the deep regress of the sp., i.e. to its habitat on a macro- and microscale as well as to its life-strategy. The high level of stenotopy and the highly specialized habitat-related behaviour, resulting in successful use of a narrow niche, are emphasized. These aspects make the sp. vulnerable in the face of high anthropogenic pressure in Europe. Limited dispersal abilities augment the danger of local extinction. The main threats are presented and some essential conservation measures are proposed.

N2  - P. quinta is a tropical sp. with 2 3 morphs: the black-winged (BW) 3 and the hyaline-winged (HW) 3; here their sexual behaviour is described. In general, 6 3 seem to spend relatively little time in flying activities. This may be explained either by the inability to recognise conspecifics and, hence, engage in social interactions, or by the reduced energetic reserves that prevent them from engaging in expensive activities. BW <J 3 were more aggressive and site-faithful than HW <J 6 . BW defended spaces containing debris (plant and wood) against conspecifics while HW did not. BW-BW, BW-HW and HW-HW aggressive encounters were common. Despite their non-aggressive nature toward BW <J <J, HW 3 3 behaved aggressively when faced by HW 3 3. The distance flown by each morph from 3 grasping of the ? until she started oviposition was measured: HW flew longer distances than BW. These differences between 3 morphs are compared to those found in Mnais p. pruinosa, another 3 dimorphic zygopteran. Similar to what happens in that sp., both tactics in P. quinta are possibly maintained due to the similar reproductive and energetic costs accrued by and benefits paid to each morph.

N2  - The postcopulatory mate guarding behaviours by territorial and non-territorial 3 3 for submerged ovipositing $ 9 were investigated in the field. After copulations, 9 9 in tandem began to oviposit at the water surface and thereafter they usually submerged completely underwater. The 9 often repeated the submergence and emergence at several oviposition sites. When the 9 submerged completely, the 3 released her without submergence and rested above the water surface during oviposition (non-submerged guarding), or the 3 submerged completely and remained in tandem, whether only at first or for the duration of the oviposition (submerged guarding). Territorial 3 3 always performed non-submerged guarding when the 9 oviposited inside their territories. The non-submerged guarding inside the territory might allow the territorial 3 both to guard the ovipositing 9 and to maintain his territory. On the other hand, when the 9 oviposited inside another 3’s territories, territorial and non-territorial 3 3 exhibited both non-submerged guarding and submerged guarding. Thus, P. p. pilidorsum 6 6 may adopt either submerged guarding or non-submerged guarding in response to change in the probability of a takeover of the emerged 9 by rival 3 3 inside another 3’s territory.

N2  - Site fidelity, the tendency to return to a previously occupied breeding location, is commonly observed in animals and yet often the benefit to such behavior is unclear. In this study, possible settlement benefits to site fidelity for P. tenera are examined, d 3 defend small mating territories on ponds and lakes to which they typically, but not always, return the following day. In an observational study, it was found that 3 3 did not become territorial earlier in the day when site-faithful than when switching territories. However, 3 3 switching territories were more likely to be seen examining oviposition sites (other than the site they ultimately defended) prior to becoming territorial than site-faithful 3 3. In an experimental study, it was controlled for differences in territory and oviposition site structure, time of day, evictions and disturbance, and found that site-faithful 3 3 spent significantly less time settling on a territory prior to defending that territory than 3 3 settling at a site for the first time. Because 3 3 examining sites are probably more at risk from predators, this study suggests that site-faithful 3 3 may experience lowered settlement costs than males returning to their original territory.

N2  - In many Zygoptera spp, 9 9 occur in different colour morphs, with one morph coloured like the d (andromorph), while the others are not (gynomorph). Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain frequency-dependent harassment of 9 morphs. According to the first, 6 d should prefer the more frequent of the 2 9 morphs (learned-mate recognition hypothesis). According to the second, d 6 should prefer andromorphs more if their frequency relative to d d increases, but not so for gynomorphs which always should be attempted to mate with on encounter (mimicry hypothesis). Here, it is reported on a re-analysis of earlier published data on morph-specific harassment for I. elegans, which allows examination of the 2 proposed hypotheses. The data were collected in 8 insectaries with different ratios of d d and 9 morphs. As reported earlier, d harassment is highest on the most common 9 morph supporting the learned-mate recognition hypothesis. The ratio of andromorphs to d d had no morph-specific effects in amounts of d harassment, wherefore the data suggest rejection of the mimicry hypothesis.

N2  - Mnais costalis 3 3 exist in 2 forms specialised for the demands of 2 distinct strategies, territorial fighters and non-territorial sneaks, which give approximately equal fitness payoffs. Territorial 3 6 have orange wings, whereas typical non-territorial 3 3 are clear-winged. By simulating agonistic encounters between 3 3 it is shown that the 2 morphs showed distinct responses to the signal from orange wings; territorial orange-winged 3 <5 always tried to enter contests, while clear-winged 3 3 always avoided them. On the other hand, the 2 morphs showed similar responses to the signal from clear wings: both morphs tried to attack models. Also presented are ‘painted clear models’ which were clear-winged 3 3 whose wings had been painted orange, and both morphs responded as if they were orange-winged models. These observations indicate that 3 3 discriminate between fighter and sneaker morphs using the colour of wings, and shows different styles of agonistic responses toward fighter and sneaker morphs. It is likely that non-territorial sneaks may gain an advantage from non-signalling because clear wings increase crypsis on another 3 territory, increasing their success in stealing copulations. No indication was found that clear-winged 3 3 are 9 mimics, or that having clear wings reduced the level of aggression directed towards them by territorial orange-winged 3 3.

N2  - The reproductive behaviour was divided into four phases: perching (phase I), less than 1 min from the start of copulation (phase II), more than 3 min from the start of copulation (Phase III) and more than 1 min from the start of oviposition (phase IV). The body temperature (Tb) of the S was highest in phase III, while in the $ Tb was not significantly different among phases. The changes of Tb are different between the sexes, however, they are both influenced largely by the wind as well as by the air temperature, and particularly in the 9 the effect seems to be larger than in the S, possibly because of its smaller body size.

N2  - Coexistence of discrete 9 colour morphs is a common characteristic of many odon. species. Surveys have found that for some North American and European genera, half or more of the spp. show female-limited polymorphism, while in other genera, 9 polymorphism appears far less common among spp. One such genus is Lestes with reportedly only one sp. (L. sponsa) being polymorphic. Here are described andromorphs and heteromorphs for L. disjunctus. Female-limited polymorphism might be more common, even in this genus, than is perceived currently. 9 morph frequencies were estimated for 4 consecutive yr.: andromorphs constitute approximately 16% of mature 9 9 sampled and this proportion is fairly consistent between years. Similar to other published reports on other spp., andromorphs and heteromorphs in this study population did not differ in wing length or mass. Seasonal patterns in representation of different morphs suggest that further research should be done on timing of emergence of andromorphs versus heteromorphs in this and perhaps other spp.

All larvae were collected during the dry season and adults only during the wet season. The highest number of larvae was collected in pools having litter as substrate, but they were also found in slow and moderate velocity water. Due to their patched distribution, H. amazona may face high risk of local extinction and such a possibility should be taken into account in the management of both studied nature reserves.

N2  - Zygoptera spp. either perch with their wings open or closed. The alternatives do not appear to be phylogenetically constrained, as there are sexual differences in Ecchlorolestes peringueyi, and population variation and individual variation in Pseudagrion sublacteum. Open wings would appear to be more conspicuous to predators (Shiny Wing Hypothesis). Yet there is a difference between clear and coloured, banded wings in Chlorolestes spp. Clear wings appear to be associated with crypsis, either in open or forest habitats. For spp. that have banded wings (and banded bodies), those individuals that are banded are aggressively territorial to clear-winged conspecifics and are sexually more attractive to ? $. Open-winged perching behaviour is associated with perching on tips of shoots and rapid escape from ground predators, supporting the Quick Takeoff Hypothesis. Conspicuous open-winged perching for banded-wing individuals appears to be a tradeoff between territorial superiority on the one hand and predation from aerial predators, particularly birds, on the other. Predation however, appears to be minor relative to the advantages gained by conspicuousness.

N2  - (15761) SAIKI, M.K. &T.P. LOWE, 1987. Selenium in aquatic organisms from subsurface agricultural drainage water, San Joaquin Valley, California. Archs emir. Contam. Toxicol. 16: 657-670. — (US Fish & Wildl. Serv., Natn. Fisheries Contaminant Res. Cent., Field Res, Stn, 6924 Tremont Rd, Dixon, CA 95620, USA). Concentrations of total selenium were investigated in plant and animal samples from Kesterson Reservoir, receiving agricultural drainage water (Merced Co.) and, as a reference, from the Volta Wildlife Area, ca 10 km S of Kesterson, which has high quality irrigation water. Overall, selenium concentrations in samples from Kesterson averaged about 100-fold higher than those from Volta. Thus, in May and Aug. 1983, the concentrations (pg/g dry weight) at Kesterson in larval Zygoptera had a range of 160- 220 and in Anisoptera 50-160. In Volta, these values were 1.2-2.I and 1.1-2.5, respectively. In comparison, A.K. Furr et al. (1979, N. Y. Fish Game J. 26: 154-161) reported the selenum content of Plathemis lydia larvae from a control pond as 1.5 pg/g, while in the specimens from a nearby pond, contaminated by coal fly ash, it was 4.1 pg/g.

N2  - The larva from the area of Panguana (Huanuco prov., Peru) is described. This constitutes the first description of a Polythore. P-distance measuring of a 790 bp long fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene was used as a tool for the assignment of the larva. The low degree of sequence divergences between larval and imaginal COI sequences leaves no doubt about conspecificity. The use of scanning electron microscopy gives an impression of some morphological characters not mentioned so far concerning polythorid larvae. Comparison of the P. spaeteri larva with the few currently available descriptions of polythorid larvae shows that characterisation of the larvae at generic level is not possible until more larval specimens of the family are examined.

N2  - The present immunocytochemical study reveals the presence of well-defined endocrine cells, intermingled with the columnar cells of the epithelium in the midgut region of the alimentary canal of T. virginia. The midgut endocrine cells are of 2 types, the open-type midgut endocrine cells (OMEC) with a long tubule opening into the lumen of the midgut and close-type midgut endocrine cells (CMEC) which are spherical in shape and devoid of extending tubules. Various gastrointestinal hormone-like substances are localized in respective types of midgut endocrine cells in different regions of the midgut i.e. anterior, middle and posterior. The NPY, FMRFamide and 3-endorphin were localized in the open-type while substance P, gastrin, CCK and VIP in the close-type midgut endocrine cells. The midgut endocrine cells in T. Virginia differ from each other in their location, cytomorphological and immunocytochemical characteristics representing different types of endocrine cells. Functional significance of these myotropic and vertebrate gastrointestinal hormone-like substances in the midgut endocrine cells of T. Virginia is discussed.

N2  - Adults of the 4 spp., inhabiting an estuarine landscape that includes reed communities and rice paddy fields established on water of varying saline concentration in Mie prefecture, Japan, were studied. The fecundity of Ischnura spp. was higher than that of Mortonagrion spp. I. senegalensis contained the largest number of mature, submature, and immature eggs with the smallest mature egg size, whereas M. selenion contained the smallest number of immature eggs with the largest mature egg size. During a 3- day laboratory oviposition experiment without food, all 2 2 developed eggs, resulting in a greater number of mature eggs than was originally contained. Most of the eggs that developed to maturity were laid by M. selenion and I. asiatica, while M. hirosei laid only half of the number laid by either of these. The oviposition process of the 4 spp, is discussed from the viewpoint of their larval habitat selection.

I. haritonovi Dumont, 1997), Aeshna cyanea, Anax imperator and Libellula depressa is confirmed, but that of Pyrrhosoma nymphula, Sympecma fusca, Cordulegaster boltonii and Libellula fulva is not. Aeshna undulata Bartenev, 1909 is a probable synonym of A. juncea Linnaeus, 1758. /. aralensis, C. ecornutum, Enallagma cyathigerum risi and S. graeseri were found W as well as E of the Ural River, and thus are part of the fauna of Europe. Several western spp. reach their limit of eastward extent in S. Ural and, conversely, several eastern (Siberian) spp. reach their limit of westward extent there too. The range of I. aralensis is discussed in the light of the contractions and expansions of the Caspian-Aral lakes during the Late Pleistocene. The current disjunct positions of its colonies is understood as the result of the present phase of aridity in middle Asia.

N2  - The egg chorion of the dragonfly B. geminata undergoes major structural changes when incubated in paper mill effluent. The exochorion becomes blemished, marred and perforated. It bunches into a granular condition and looses its jelly-like original identity. The endochorion develops cracks and is pitted with holes. The hexagonal demarcations of the endochorion plates are obliterated and replaced by a network of angular surface reticulations. The micropylar stalk and the circular basal ridge dissolve and distort the micropylar apparatus.

N2  - Using a nylon filament implant inserted in the thorax, it was tested whether there were immune ability and size differences between territorial and nonterritorial 3 6 that gather in lentic aquatic sites. It was found that territorial 3 3 mounted a larger melanin-based immune response than nonterritorial 3 3. This is coherent with current results in other odon. and is interpreted as territorial 3 3 being in better condition than nonterritorial 3 3. However, there was no size difference between the territorial and nonterritorial inidividuals. This suggests that size may be a poor predictor of immune ability.

N2  - The last instar larvae were treated with sub-lethal concentrations of paper mill effluent (PME) for 5 days. PME inhibits the synthesis of neurohormones in the A-type cells of the medial group of the brain and in the intrinsic neurosecretory cells of the corpora cardiaca. PME also causes histomorphological changes in the corpora allata and suppress protease activity of the midgut. These findings suggest that various metamorphic and intermediary metabolic alterations caused by the PME treatment is modulated by the changes in the synthesis and secretion of the neurohorraones of the cephalic neurosecretory complex.

Differences between the larva of Neodythemis and that of other known African Tetrathemistinae genera ( Malgassophlebia, Notiothemis and Tetrathemis) are highlighted, and it is suggested that this provides support for the view that Neodythemis (including Allorrhizucha) and Micromacromia form a natural group, the ‘neodythemistines’, and that they are only distantly related to other genera in the subfamily. This provides additional evidence for the view that Tetrathemistinae is not a phylogenetically homogenous grouping within the Libellulidae.

N2  - The larval antennae of E. lindenii are short and made up of a scape, a pedicel and a fourth-segmented flagellum. They bear four types of aporous and exclusively mechanoreceptive sensilla: spatula-shaped sensilla chaetica, curved sensilla chaetica, sensilla filiformia and sensilla campaniformia. The curved sensilla chaetica are proprioceptors which monitor the relative position of the 3rd and 4,h flagellomeres. Sensilla filiformia are vibration receptors which play the major role in prey detection. The unique sensillum campaniformium on the pedicel is a proprioceptor which informs the larva of the position of the flagellum relative to the pedicel. Spatula-shaped sensilla chaetica are tactile receptors distributed on the scape and the pedicel. No chemoreceptive sensilla has been observed on the antennae.

N2  - The spatial patterns in species richness and abundance were investigated here at a series of reservoirs at different elevations, to establish which factors determine species distributions along this topographic gradient. Larvae of 18 spp. were sampled in small reservoirs across a 1250 m elevational gradient at one latitude. Most spp. occurred throughout all elevations indicating that this subtropical odon. assemblage as a whole is remarkably tolerant of elevational changes. Although Anisoptera larval species richness and abundance increased significantly with increasing elevation, there was no change in Zygoptera species richness, while Zygoptera abundance decreased significantly. Species-site-variable triplots for Anisoptera and Zygoptera larvae indicated that no measured site variable on an individual basis clearly accounted for larval species assemblage distribution patterns. Nevertheless, canonical axes and their respective intra-set correlation coefficients showed that some measured site variables e.g. floating/submerged vegetation, turbidity, pH, water temperature (resulting from sunny or shade habitat conditions), marginal grasses, water depth as well as elevation to some extent, explained the main variation in species assemblage composition/distribution in a broadly similar manner for both suborders. Generally, the reservoirs recruited spp. from the regional pool, irrespective of the elevation of the pool. These spp. were all geographically widespread spp, that took advantage of the presence of these man-made reservoirs, and included only one national endemic. Although these artificial water bodies are not increasing the ‘extent of species occurrence’, they play a major role in increasing ‘area of occupancy’. Furthermore, these spp. are remarkably vagile, habitat-tolerant, as well as elevationally-widespread. A reasonable explanation is that this assemblage is the historical survivor over many millennia of oscillating wet/dry periods and natural selection. The present-day spp. are those that readily recolonise pools after drought has been broken, and are pioneering residents of new water bodies over a wide elevational range.

N2  - Invasive alien organisms are a major threat to indigenous biodiversity. Invasive alien trees (IATs) are a component of this threat to South African ©donates. IATs shade out the habitat of the sun-loving odonate species. A national programme to remove IATs from river systems has been initiated in South Africa. Results from widely-separated sites show that the impacts of IATs are the same in different physiognomic areas. In turn, removal of the IATs is beneficial to a range of species from narrow endemics to widespread generalists. Indications are that this nation-wide lAT-removal programme is beneficial across a wide geographical area, leading to rapid and significant odonate assemblage recovery. The lAT-removal programme must also consider removal of alien seedlings so as not to reverse the recovery programme.

Several Zygoptera collections are also reported along with county distribution information, and recommendations for future odon. surveys and monitoring are offered. (16023) YANOVIAK, S.P, 1999. Community structure in water-filled tree holes of Panama; effects of hole height and size. Selbyana 20: 106-115. – (Evergreen St. Coll., Lab. I, Olympia, WA 98505, USA). Water-filled tree holes are common aquatic habitats in many neotropical forests, yet little is known of factors influencing their biodiversity. Here, community parameters (species richness, abundance and composition) of tree hole macroorganisms are compared at different heights (canopy, midstory, understory) in the forest of Barro Colorado Isl., Panama. Data from multiple censuses of 40 artificial tree holes during 3 wet seasons (1995-1997) revealed a small but significant decrease in the average number of spp. present with increasing height above the ground. Species richness and abundance were greater in larger holes. Similar patterns were observed in 206 natural tree holes. Of 7 top predator spp. (inch 3 odon. taxa), Megaloprepus coerulatus larvae were not found in artificial or natural holes above 7 m. Chemical properties of tree hole water did not ditfer with height, but canopy tree holes dried out more frequently and were thermally less stable than midstory and understory holes. Harsh thermal conditions and higher disturbance frequency may be responsible for the decline in species richness with height.

N2  - The sp. inhabits swift mountain streams at montane elevations of southern Papua New Guinea. In this study the duration for which adult 3 3 and 9 9 remained at a given site in rainforest streams was determined, and the dispersal distance and direction of marked individuals leaving the site of initial observation was assessed. Territorial defence was non-exclusive and S 3 held territories for up to 45 days. On average, 3 3 remained 9 days, 9 9 11 days at a given site. Both sexes stayed significantly longer at sites with suitable oviposition substrates than at a site without. Mating occurred only twice during the study period, and the scarcity of mating events might explain long territory holding times. On a daily basis d 3 moved larger distances than 9 9, suggesting that 9 9 remain at a site for a longer period before moving a long distance. Both sexes showed similar lifetime dispersal distances (1000-1300m), and dispersal was predominantly directed upstream. It is concluded that this unidirectional dispersal of adults may compensate for downstream drift of larvae in rapid flowing streams.

N2  - Using the IUCN categories and criteria, the conservation status of the South African dragonfly fauna has been assessed. IUCN recommendations for adjusting the global categories and criteria for national red listing have been taken into consideration, A total of 40 taxa are listed as threatened or near-threatened, which is 25% of the national total (160 sp. and ssp.). The precautionary rather than evidentiary approach is taken throughout, especially as many sp. are marginal and although not threatened globally are highly threatened locally. Nevertheless, it is clear that locally the South African odonate fauna is under severe threat, especially the stream sp. Many of the threats are synergistic, both with natural drought/flood cycles, and with other threats. Restoration of hydrological regimes and riparian conditions are promoting conservation of this odonate assemblage.

The diet was dominated by littoral macrobenthos, particularly amphipods. There was ontogenetic variation in the diet, with small young-of-the-year feeding on several littoral microcrustaceans, especially the cladocerans, whereas larger fish shifted to freshwater shrimps, snails and Zygoptera larvae (Pyrrhosoma nymphula was identified).

N2  - The analysis of distribution data of odon. in NW Spain indicates the presence of 49 spp. Macromia splendens, Oxygastra curtisii, Gomphus graslini and Coenagrion mercuriale are protected under the European Habitats Directive and Spanish Law. Localities of specimens collected between 1978 and 2004 were situated in UTM squares of 10x10 km to produce a map of species richness for the region. Additionally, all localities (UTM 1 x 1 km) where protected and rare spp. were found are introduced in a GIS system, on a map of the Natura 2000 network of the region. The results indicate that O. curtisii and C. mercuriale are common in NW Spain. As local rare taxa are identified Brachytron pratense, Aeshna affinis and Erythromma viridulum, , because they were found in less than 10 squares, and are also relatively rare in the Iberian peninsula. As areas of special interest are selected those that include all known populations of M. splendens, G. graslini, and B. pratense, all localities with at least 2 of the 4 protected spp., and areas with more than 20 spp. This gives a list of 24 hotspots, most of them (15) at least partially included in the Natura 2000 network. Unfortunately the analysis also reveals that the knowledge of this group is clearly fragmentary, with most records concentrated on the coastal region, and very few squares sampled more than 20 times, the minimum to obtain reliable data. Therefore a systematic sampling of the region is needed to properly identify areas with high species richness.

N2  - Compared to other regions in the world, the islands scattered over the south-western Pacific Ocean remain largely unstudied with respect to damselfly biology. Only a few studies have been undertaken and these have been mainly of a taxonomic nature. Here, an overview is presented of the diversity, abundance, distribution and field diagnostic characteristics of spp. within the Fijian genus Nesobasis, one of the most speciose odonate genera found in any oceanic island group in the world. 24 spp. (2 undescribed) were encountered during a 2-month visit in the dry season of 2005, collected from Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. This brings the total number of spp. currently known for the genus to 31 (of which only 21 are at present formally described). Information is provided on species diversity and abundances at the major collecting sites. For both islands the most speciose location harboured 8 spp. Abundant spp. tended to be widespread, while less abundant spp. were usually restricted in occurrence to a few sites. Included are basic species descriptions and observations on reproductive activities.

Other noticeable features of Tepuibasis are a bifid apical penis segment, and a spiny, auricle-like process directed proximad, at the base of each of the lobes forming bifid tip. Tepuibasis evolved out of ancestral teinobasine stock with considerable morphogenetic potential reflected by the large number of recent genera present in cratonic S. America, which is equaled only by insular SE Asia. Taxogeny of Tepuibasis was triggered by the uplift of the Guyana shield, and the vicariant species are the result of secondary isolation through fracturing and partial erosion of these highlands.

N2  - P. flavescens was investigated in open fields in a deciduous forest in an inland part of the Kanto region for 3 months from late June 2003. The sp. was estimated to be bivoltine from summer to late autumn. The size of the adults was unchanged throughout the season. The sex ratio of the population skewed towards 9. Maturity degree (MD), shown as the value of body weight divided by the cube of wing length, shifted upwards until the second half of August, after which it decreased sharply. Similarly the wing loading (WL) (calculated by dividing body weight by wing area) increased until the second half of August, and decreased from September, and in early October it was not significantly different between S 3 and 9 $. As the relationship of body temperature to ambient temperature showed no difference between mature and immature individuals, or between sexes, with both correlation coefficients and regression coefficients being large for a flyer type sp., they seemed to be easily affected by the ambient temperature.

N2  - Although the larval habitats of S. infuscatum are paddy fields, all adults leave the paddy fields for forest gaps after emergence, and remain there during their sexually immature stages. In late summer when they have matured, some visit the paddy fields in tandem flight for oviposition. However, many 9 9 remain perching in the forest gaps, where no mating behaviour is observed. To evaluate the habitat selection of S. infuscatum 9 9 in the forest gaps, fecundity was examined by means of dissection. In the morning, the 9 9 remaining in the forest gaps loaded fewer mature eggs (ca 100) than did ovipositing 9 9 in the paddy fields (ca 300). 9 9 remaining in the forest gaps throughout the day were not willing to visit the paddy fields for oviposition due to the low egg number loaded. This could be because these 9 9 were developing their eggs, having loaded more sub-mature eggs (ca 60) than ovipositing females in the paddy fields (ca 30). As a result, in the evening, 9 9 that had developed nearly 500 eggs appeared. In an artificial oviposition experiment, the 9 9 in the paddy fields released their eggs significantly faster (60 eggs/min) than did those in the forest gaps (16 eggs/min), and released almost all of their eggs, while the 9 9 in the forest gaps retained a considerable number of eggs in their ovaries. Although 9 9 loaded 400 ovarioles irrespective of their age, the number of immature eggs per ovariole decreased with age. Consequently, a 9 might have laid more than 2000 eggs in her life span. 9 9 must visit the paddy fields cyclically several times in a single month and stay in the forest gaps during the other days.

(Kabaena Island), D. penicillata sp. n. (central Sulawesi) and D. watuwilensis sp. n. (SE Sulawesi) are described as new to science. A key to the <J 6 is provided. Based on the structure of posterior margin of the pronotum, D. ephippiata presumably represents a monophyletic clade with the D. lymetta and D. megametta species-groups, including spp. from the mainland of New Guinea. This group is distributed from Mindanao (Philippines) eastward to the northern Moluccas, northern New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The newly described spp. are morphologically quite diverse; they are presumably most closely related to spp. occurring SE of Sulawesi.

Park 2000:65-76. — (Envir. Sci. Graduate Progr., Ohio St. Univ., USA; address not provided). The macroinvertebrate diversity of 2 man-made experimental ponds (surface 1 ha each) in the Olentangy R. Wetland Research Park, Columbus, Ohio, was examined during 10-29 Oct. 2000. The odon. were identified as “Lestes” and “Libellula”. (16380) LYTLE, D. A., 2000. Biotic and abiotic effects of flash flooding in a montane desert stream. Arch. Hydrobiol. 150(1); 85-100. – (Dept Ecol. & Evol., Univ. Chicago, 1101 E 57th St., Chicago, IL 60637, USA). Flash floods in desert streams can be more sudden, brief, and severe compared to floods in mesic streams. To determine their biotic and abiotic effects, substrate composition, organic detritus abundance, and aquatic animal taxonomic richness and abundance were measured 8-16 d before and 7 d after a flash flood in a 122 m reach of a montane desert stream (Chihuahuan Desert, Arizona, USA). The flash flood severely altered channel morphology by scouring and depositing substrates, but it did not change the overall abundance of any substrate particle size class. The flood removed most coarse detritus from the stream reach, although the quantity of organic particles <2 mm was unchanged. High losses were observed in most animal taxa (95% overall), and reach-wide taxonomic richness was reduced from 35 to 21 taxa. Ephemeroptera were entirely eliminated from the study reach, and so were Argia and Cordulegaster diadema. The overall odon. losses amounted to 87%. Compared to studies of flooding in mesic streams, this study suggests that flash floods in montane desert streams cause greater mortality in animal populations and remove more detritus. Ecologically, these high local mortality rates stress the importance of recolonization mechanisms. Evolutionarily, flash floods provide a strong selection pressure that may influence the genetic structure of populations.

N2  - Freshwater ectoparasitic mites negatively alter host population dynamics by reducing survivorship, mating success, fitness and altering activity patterns. Hosts commonly include dragonflies. The Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve, South Africa, is a major hotspot for endemic dragonflies. All 38 dragonfly species in the reserve were sampled for ectoparasitic mites, but only 2 common, widespread spp. of Zygoptera, Ischnura senegalensis and Ceriagrion glabrum, were infested with Arrenurus or Leptus mite spp. None of the endemic or red-listed dragonflies were infested. Parasitism level was 3.5% for C. glabrum and 38% for I. senegalensis. Intensity of ectoparasites on individuals was high, with about eight ectoparasitic larva per individual. Larval mites preferentially associated with individual hosts already harbouring mites. High levels of species-specific parasitism likely reflects shared environmental requirements, preferential species selection, and lack of defensive behaviours to resist infestation. Characteristic scars from previous mite attachment observed on older individuals of I. senegalensis indicate that a much larger percentage of the population was actually parasitized, but detached as the individual aged. That the rare and red-listed species were apparently immune from infestation is a positive note for their conservation.

N2  - The results of the mark and recapture method for estimating the number of M. hirosei adults were compared to those of census counts using the line transect method carried out in the same habitat, a dense reed community established in brackish water. The mark and recapture method gave a daily estimate of about 1000 and 800 individuals of each sex at the peak population in early July of 2003 and 2004, respectively. These results did not agree with the estimate from the census counts, giving 600 6 at that time in the same habitat. Some limitations of the line transect method were discussed for estimates of adults perching in the understory of the dense reed community. However, a relationship was observed with regard to daily population estimates of the line transect method and the mark and recapture method, indicating that the line transect method can be an effective tool for monitoring populations of the endangered damselflies inhabiting such a dense plant community.

Densities of Corixidae (Hemiptera), larval Odon., and large larval Trichoptera were estimated in the littoral zone of small lakes in an acid-stressed area near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Fish were present in some lakes and absent in others, and fishless lakes occurred across a wide range of pH. Anisopt. larvae tended to be more numerous in benthic samples from fishless lakes than from lakes with fish, and their exuviae were significantly more abundant around fishless lakes. In most lakes, the assemblage was dominated by Leucorrhinia glacialis, Libellula Julia, and Cordulia shurtleffi. In lakes containing white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) Gomphus spp. were most numerous. In the most acid fishless lakes, L. Julia was uncommon, and L. glacialis was extremely abundant. In fishless lakes, numbers of Anisopt. larvae and exuviae were negatively correlated with pH, though species richness was positively correlated with pH.

In the East-Asian clade 2, the genus Matrona to be descended from an Asian Atrocalopteryx-like is found ancestor. Several so-called South-East Calopteryx probably either belong to Atrocalopteryx or to as yet unnamed genera near Atrocalopteryx. Archineura consists of 2 spp., limited to China and Indo-China, and is rather basal to clade 3, The subclade Neurobasis-Matronoides is worthy of further analysis.

N2  - In the last larval instar (F-0) of L. depressa, 2 paired spiracles, in the form of elongated eye-shaped structures, are located in the anterior region of the mesothorax segment. A fine structural analysis of these spiracles under the scanning and electron microscopes reveals that each spiracle consists of a well-developed cuticular peritreme with a dorsal-anterior lip bearing a thin laminar coat and a ventral-posterior lip bearing a filter apparatus. The filter apparatus derives from a series of folds forming discrete groups adhering to one another to delimit empty spaces and producing a honeycomb-like structure. This structure is coherent with the need to avoid entry of water when the larva is submerged. The function of these spiracles during the insect development is discussed, noting that in anisopteran larvae the rectal epithelium, forming the so called branchial basket, is the main respiratory organ.

N2  - The 3 6 hover frequently during patrolling flight, and fiercely chase rival S3. Their patrolling flight was videotaped and analyzed. The average net-patrol flight speed (except hovering) was 161.6130.6 cm/s faster in the morning and the evening than during the day. Also, hovering frequency was more frequent and the duration of hovering bouts was longer in the morning and the evening than during the day, and was synchronized with patrolling flight speed. However, chasing flight was not related to patrolling or hovering and the duration of chasing bout was about 4-5 seconds with an average flight speed of 274.6±64.7cm/s. The body temperatures of patrolling flight and chasing flight were significantly different; the former, 39.811,4°C, the latter was 40.4il.0°C. The time budget of patrolling males based upon video pictures was calculated and the relative energy expenditure of patrolling 3 3 was estimated by standardizing the average net-patrolling flight speed as 1. Energy expenditure of the 3 3 was greater in the morning and the evening than during the day. It is assumed that energy expenditure was affected by ambient temperatures, with 3 3 changing the flight speed and duration of hovering. The 3 3 are inferior in their sex recognition and it is assumed that their frequent hovering with concurrent large energy expenditure is to enable 3 3 to distinguish 9 9.

N2  - The daily activity patterns, behaviour and population dynamics in Zygoptera are thought to be affected by the physical conditions of the environment. How and why the sp. reacts to those conditions is determined mainly by its bionomic characteristics. Here, an auto-ecological study is performed of T. aurantinigrum, in an attempt to clarify its responses to physical conditions. It is suggested that T. aurantinigrum could fit, with a few assumptions, in the “female-control” classification of odon. mating system. Some interactions were observed between individuals, but it is assumed that these play a role in sex recognition, rather than in territorial contests. The results indicate that this sp. is affected by the following physical conditions: the monthly rain fall, which has a positive effect on the abundance (with the possible exception of the heavy rain months); the water flow velocity, which seems to define a limit of its occurrence; and the daily variation in temperature, which seems to induce the sp. to restrict its activity to the hottest period of the day, as expected from a “thermal conformer”. T. aurantinigrum appears to be affected by small scale variations of environmental variables, as observed by the differences of its abundance at the 3 different sites of this study. Under conditions of the current “forest-to-pasture” conversion that is common in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest region, the sp. is expected to increase its abundance and to broaden its geographical range, although water body alterations could limit this process.

N2  - This study attempted to design and conduct an in situ field experiment using E. designatus larvae collected from the reference site and then exposed at 4 potentially impacted urban sites; all in the sub-watersheds of the city of Denton, Texas, USA. Before placing them in the urban site enclosures, head width, total width, wing pad length and wet weight were measured. The surviving larvae were retrieved after 6 weeks and all parameters were measured again in order to assess the difference between the reference and urban sites. No survival was observed at 2 urbanized sites in both spring and summer, and at another urbanized site in spring. The differences in survival of the larvae may be influenced by the differences in hydrology and water quality, especially during the summer experimental period. In the spring, a statistically significantly higher growth rate (p <0.05) occurred at one of the urban sites compared to the reference site. The difference in growth rate may have been influenced by less fluctuation and higher minimum water temperature at the urban site. Although the experiment was only partially successful, it did indicate that the local common odon. taxa found at the reference site could be used for field biomonitoring experiments to assess water quality of urban sites. If fully successful, this type of in situ field experiment may indicate actual impacts rather than attempting to apply conclusions based on either laboratory microcosm or mesocosm-based toxicity tests.

N2  - Under experimental conditions, the relationship between substrate composition, with and without the presence of an emergence support, and larval distribution was investigated. Results revealed that C. splendens larvae showed a clear preference for a pebble substrate as opposed to sand or silt, when all 3 substrates were equally available. However, the substrate type decreased in importance as the density of the emergence support increased. Results suggest that the morphological adaptations of C. splendens larvae, to cling to a substrate, can be utilised equally in a vegetated habitat and a habitat predominated by pebbles and cobbles. This has implications for the dispersal of C. splendens to areas containing, traditionally, less favoured habitat. Range expansion of C. splendens on its northern borders, where aquatic habitat characteristics can differ markedly from waterways in lowland southern England, is discussed.

N2  - The dragonfly genus Celithemis consists of 8 spp., some of them common and brightly colored, that are confined largely to eastern North America. Several spp. have been used in behavioral, ecological, and morphological studies, but their intrageneric phylogeny is unclear. In this paper is provided a phylogeny based on morphology and on data from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences of multiple individuals of each species. The genus appears to be monophyletic, with one nested species pair (C. amanda + C. martha) receiving strong bootstrap support by both parsimony or maximum-likelihood criteria as well as high Bayesian posterior probability. A second group (C. bertha, C. elisa, C. ornata and C. fasciata) is well-supported in Bayesian analysis but only weakly by parsimony and maximum-likelihood bootstrap values. C. verna and C. eponina are probably basal to both these groups, but their relationship to each other is unclear. All individuals assigned to a species recognized on morphological -grounds were recovered as monophyletic. The problematic taxa, C. monomalaena and C. bertha leonora, are shown definitively to be synonyms of C. fasciata and C. bertha, respectively.

N2  - Differences in phenoloxidase (PO) and hydrolytic enzymes (HE) activity, two key components in insect immune ability, were investigated in Hetaerina americana and Argia tezpi, to see if they are correlated with patterns of gregarine and mite infection. The prediction was that the sp. with the more robust immune responses would show a less intense parasitic burden. Fully mature adults of both sexes were used. No clear pattern was found: H. americana had higher PO activity while A. tezpi had higher HE activity but the latter sp. had a higher parasitic load for both parasites. Several possible explanations are discussed. However, it seems most likely that either the immune responses measured may be traded-off with other non-immune functions in which both spp. differ in investment or that both immune components may be traded-off with each other

N2  - The AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) technique was used to compare the levels of genetic diversity and differentiation among Paracercion calamorum, Ischnura senegalensis and I. asiatica and to compare the genetic structure of populations found in highly fragmented urban habitats to populations in relatively continuous rural habitats. For all 3 spp., high genetic diversity was found in both areas. However, population genetic differentiation among urban populations was approximately twice that of rural populations, indicating that movements between habitat patches are more restricted in urban areas, probably due to human disturbances that may function as barriers. Inter-specific differences regarding genetic diversity and differentiation are further discussed in terms of habitat specificity.

N2  - (16851) FRANK, J.H. & E.D. McCOY, 1995. Precinctive insect species in Florida. Fla Ent. 78(1): 21-35. — (First Author: Ent. & Nematol. Dept, Univ. Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA). The Florida (USA) insect spp. are classified into 6 categories, for which the following terminology is used; (1) Indigenous (native): (a) precinctive (native and restricted to the area specified), (b) indigenous but not precinctive (native to the area specified and elsewhere); (2) Adventive (non-indigenous, arrived from elsewhere): (c) immigrant (not native to the area specified, and arrived there by means other than purposeful introduction), and (d) introduced (not native to the area specified and arrived there by purposeful introduction. – An estimated 144odon, spp. were indigenous to Florida at the time of the European discovery (40 Zygopt., 104 Anisopt.). Of these, 1 Zygopt. and 4 Anisopt. spp. are precinctive. There are now 12 established spp. of immigrant Odon.: 1 from Asia, 3 from N America, and 8 from neotropics. No odon. sp. has been (deliberately) introduced to Florida. Additionally, 7 spp. have been found as vagrants, without breeding populations. (16852) LABHARXT.&D.-E. NILSSON, 1995. The dorsal eye of the dragonfly Sympetrum: specializations for prey against the blue sky. J. comp. Physiol. (A) 176:437-453. — (First Authr: Zool. Inst, Univ. Zurich, Winterthurerstr. 190, CH-8057 Zurich). Dragonflies of the genus Sympetrum have compound eyes conspicuously divided into dorsal and ventral regions. Using anatomical, optical, electro-physiological, in-vivo photochemical and microspectrophotometrical methods, the design and physiology of the dorsal part which is characterized by a pale yellow-orange screening pigment and extremely large facets were investigated in S. vulgatum. The upper part of the yellow dorsal region is a pronounced fovea with interommatidial angles approaching 0.3°, contrasting to the much larger values of l.5°-2° in the rest of the eye. The dorsal eye part is exclusively sensitive to short wavelengths (below 520 nm). It contains predominantly blue-receptors with a sensitivity maximum at 420 nm, and a smaller amount of UV-receptors. The metarhodopsin of the blue-receptors absorbs maximally at 535 nm. The yellow screening pigment transmits longwavelength light (cut-on 580 nm), which increases the conversion rate from metarhodopsin to rhodopsin. It is demonstrated that because of the yellow pigment screen nearly all of the photopigment is in the rhodopsin state under natural conditions, thus maximizing sensitivity. Theoretical considerations show that the extremely long rhabdoms (I. I mm) in the dorsal fovea are motivated for absorption reasons alone. A surprising consequence of the long rhabdoms is that the sensitivity gain, caused by pumping photopigment into the rhodopsin state, is small. To explain this puzzling fact, arguments are presented for a mechanism producing a gradient of rhodopsin concentration along the rhabdom, which would minimize saturation of transduction units, and hence improve the signal-tonoise ratio at high intensities. The latter is of special importance for the short integration time and high contrast sensitivity these animals need for spotting small prey at long distances.

N2  - Parasitic larval mites of the genus Arrenurus have been found on C. puella. A. bicuspidator, A. cuspidator and A. maculator make up over 80% of the total mites identified. The other spp. found were A. bruzelii, A. claviger and members of the A. affinis complex. Mites are found mainly between the second and third pairs of legs and behind the third pair. A. bicuspidator and A. cuspidator share these sites with numbers spread roughly equally on both sites. A. maculalor is found almost exclusively behind the third pair of legs and on the first abdominal segment of the host. Smaller numbers are found on the abdominal segments where A. claviger is the dominant species. The larval mites show a preference for $ hosts. Size differences between the Arrenurus spp. are considered.

N2  - The site fidelity and satellite behaviour in relation to mating success were investigated in L. fulva 3 3 during 2 reproductive seasons (2002-2003) in eastern Hungary. There was no difference in mating success in 3 3 that were faithful to 1, 2 or 3 independent territories. Those that were site-faithful had a higher mating success than non site-faithful 3 3. Site-faithful 3 3 showed satellite behaviour more frequently than non site-faithful ones. 3 3 used both of the 2 tactics and this switching ability was independent of 3 body size. The better mate-rewarding tactic appears to show site fidelity and satellite behaviour alternatively.

N2  - During territorial behaviour, aggressive attacks among heterospecific odon. 3 3 are common and may cause a separation of niches, based on the preferred sites for territorial defence. Here, territorial behaviour and the characteristics of territories in <Jdof Erythrodiplax media, Micrathyria catenata and M. hesperis are described and their territorial fidelity, capturing and marking of <3 3 are discussed. In all spp. studied, there was a clear distinction among the microhabitats defended as territories. In both Micrathyria spp., 3 3 seem to defend territories with defined resources. In E. media, the defended resources are less evident. Its 3 3 are highly aggressive and show high territorial fidelity but, apparently, they lose the territory if they stay away from water for at least one day.

N2  - Five hypotheses for the evolution of conspicuous 6 wing pigmentation have been proposed: sexual selection, differential niche utilisation, predator warning, social badge and ecological character displacement. Here, the sexual selection and ecological character displacement hypotheses are compared. First, the coefficients of variation (CVs) of pigmentation were compared against the CVs of a selected set of other animals' traits that are known to be maintained by either natural or sexual selection. Hetaerina americana, H. vulnerata, Calopteryx aequabilis, C. haemorrhoidalis and C. xanthostoma were used in order to compare CVs. Second, it was predicted that pigmentation should not differ in spp. whose populations are in sympatry (compared to allopatry) if sexual selection is driving the evolution of pigmentation (compared, for example, to an ecological character displacement hypothesis in which pigmentation between spp. should differ). Here, the pigmentation of sympatric and allopatric populations of H. americana and H. vulnerala were compared. The study produced 2 main results. First, the CVs of pigmentation were not different from the CVs of sexually selected traits in other animals; nevertheless, they were different from those of naturally selected traits. Second, the pigmentation of the 2 spp. in sympatry did not differ significantly. The same was true for allopatric populations. Taken together, these results suggest that sexual selection is the main mechanism of maintenance of pigmentation in these animals. Other alternative hypotheses for the evolution of pigmentation (differences in habitat use in both sexes, warning to predators by 6 6 and ecological character displacement) are discussed in the light of these results.

N2  - Recently, an overview of the diversity, abundance, distribution and morphological characteristics of spp. of the genus Nesobasis, endemic to Fiji, was presented for spp. occurring on the 2 largest islands of the archipelago: Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Here, this knowledge is extended by providing more extensive diversity and abundance data for the island of Vanua Levu, as well as for 4 smaller islands in Fiji: Taveuni, Koro, Ovalau and Kadavu. Previous research indicated that the Nesobasis spp. inhabiting Viti Levu and Vanua Levu are unique, with these islands having no species in common. The new data confirm this proposal and also show that smaller islands in proximity to these 2 larger islands usually contain a subset of the large island’s Nesobasis fauna. The island of Koro, however, is unusual in that, while its Nesobasis spp. are predominantly those found on Vanua Levu, it also harbours N. rufostigma, a sp. occurring on Viti Levu. Further, N. recava is endemic to Kadavu and is not found on Viti Levu, the nearest large island. Species richness is higher on large than small islands while mean species abundances were consistently higher on large islands compared to small islands. The pattern of distribution and speciation in this genus is quite complex, and is the subject of ongoing research.

N2  - The study was conducted at rice paddies in the cool temperate area of central Japan. The oviposition time period was limited to between ca 10;00 a.m. and 14:00 p.m. with a peak around noon. At an ambient temperature (Ta) below 30°C most pairs oviposited in tandem (TO) but at a Ta above 30°C in mid-summer most pairs separated shortly after the start of TO. The 9 9 continued to oviposit while being escorted by their partners. The regression coefficient of 3 body temperature (Tb) in ovipositing pairs was characteristically greater than that of the 9, and it is suggested that the 3 is more dependent on Ta than is the 9. Although the duration of oviposition was a little longer in pairs that separated after the start of oviposition, this difference was not significant. The reason why S. infuscatum starts oviposition in such a hot season of summer seems to be due to the morphological feature of its slender abdomen, which decreases abdominal light absorption at low Ta in the autumn.

N2  - The reproductive behavior is described from 2 populations on the outskirts of Santiago de Cuba, between June 2005 and May 2006. 3 3 started arriving at the water body in the morning nearly 2 h before 9 9. Sperm translocation was brief (less than 30 s), and the duration of copulation averaged about 18 min. During oviposition the 9 was guarded in tandem by the 3, except when she submerged under water, when non-contact guarding was observed. The mean duration of oviposition was about 10 min. Abiotic factors that interfered with the reproduction were wind, absence of sun, and rain; and the biotic interactions included conspecific 3 3, spiders of the genus Dolomedes, Gambusia punctata fishes and the lizard Anolis sagrei.

Head width, total length, metafemur length, forewing pad length, and length and width of premenlum were measured to determine variation between instars, and growth ratio was calculated. By Dyar’s Law, 12 larval instars were estimated. Fundamental morphological differences were found in order to distinguish the stages and at the same time to have a record of the morphological development through the stages. Finally, the last larval instar is described and illustrated.

Alpha, beta, and gamma diversity and total species richness expected for the area were estimated. Similarity in composition of odon. communities from lotic and lentic environments were analyzed according to latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, using multivariate cluster analysis. Assemblages from NW Argentina were compared to those from equivalent sites in SE Peru. Odon. species diversity was found to follow both a latitudinal (decreasing from N to S) as an altitudinal gradient (decreasing from low to high elevations). Based on IUCN (2001) criteria, the conservation status of the odon. spp. endemic to the Yungas cloud forest was assessed at a global scale; 6 spp. were assessed as of Least Concern and 2 as Near Threatened.

N2  - The survival of hibernating adults was assessed in its winter habitat in the Netherlands to gain insight in the potential importance of this life-history phase for the population dynamics of this endangered sp. Compared to other odon., monthly survival rates (Dec. 2004 – March 2005) were high (mean ± SE = 0.75 ± 0.08), but overall winter survival was low (0.42). Potential causes of mortality during hibernation are discussed. The results imply that effective protection of this sp. in the Netherlands may benefit from protection of both its breeding and wintering habitat.

N2  - Ecdysterone or 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) is a polyhydroxylated ecdysone that plays a major role in insect growth and metamorphosis. The 20E level was analyzed in 2 larval instars of the dragonfly using RP-HPLC. The presence of 20E was demonstrated for the first time in dragonflies, with the higher levels occurring in the older larval instar (larger larvae), while in the younger instar (smaller larvae) low or negligible levels were recorded. This has implications for extending the use of odon. larvae as biocontrol agents in aquatic ecosystems.

N2  - Parasitism affects all taxa and influences individual and population success. Parasitism of adult dragonflies is widespread and frequently includes gregarine (Apicomplexa) life stages in the gut of the host. This research investigates variation in gregarine parasite prevalence and load in c? versus 2 adults of Erythemis simplicicollis and Brachymesia gravida associated with 2 central Texas reservoirs in close proximity. Parasite prevalence was biased toward <J 6 E. simplicicollis and toward 9 2 B. gravida. Results suggest that gender bias in parasite prevalence is influenced by gender behavior and environment more so than by immuno-response differences between genders.

N2  - Spermatozoan dynamics in the 9 sperm storage organs of I. asiatica were examined with interrupted copulation experiments in the field. The copulation process was divided into 3 stages (I, II and III) according to the movements of the <J abdomen. 9 9 interrupted just after the termination of stage I of copulation contained a much lower number of spermatozoa, both in the bursa copulatrix and in the spermatheca, than solitary 9 9 captured before being attached by 6 3. At the tip of the 6’s secondary genitalia, there was a pair of horns which might be used to remove sperm from the bursa copulatrix and the spermatheca during copulation. The latter was joined to the base of the former by a spermatheca! duct. Since each hom of the <J genitalia was significantly shorter than the spermathecal duct, the spermatheca might be inaccessible to 3 6. The actual position of the horns in the 9 sperm storage organs during stage 1 of copulation was observed by freezing copulating pairs using quick-freeze aerosol sprays. The horns were in the bursa copulatrix, but no horns had entered the spermatheca. Additional mechanisms of sperm removal from the spermatheca are proposed.

N2  - In territorial Odonata, adult 6 3 may use 2 mating tactics that may be genetically or environmentally determined: territoriality and non-territoriality. The non-territorial tactic has been sometimes found to include 2 additional males: sneaking and wandering. The non-territorial 6 3, however, often have lower reproductive success than territorial 3 3. Studies on various Calopteryx spp. have repeatedly shown that territorial and non-territorial behaviours are conditional mating tactics and that body size does not predict 3 resource-holding potential and territorial behaviour. Instead, the resource holding potential seems to depend on the amount of 3 fat resources. Here, both territorial and wandering C. virgo 3 3 were collected from a creek in central Finland. It was found that territorial 3 3 were larger and heavier than wandering 3 3. The data show that the size of the individual may predict the reproductive tactic of some odon. 3 3 to a greater degree than previously thought.

N2  - To better understand overwintering capability of dragonflies in the African savanna, observed individuals were placed into predetermined age categories at sites along the Mogalakwena river, Limpopo province, South Africa, during mid-winter. Age categories were determined by degree of wing wear each individual had sustained. The Dragonfly Biotic Index (DBI) was used to categorize spp. into rare, widespread generalists versus rare, narrow-range specialists. All the recorded spp. were common, widespread generalists, occupying microhabitats created by the winter dry season decrease in water level and flow rate, and able to survive seasonal habitat changes. Seven of the 8 spp. were libellulids, and 1 gomphid. Their ability to thermoregulate by selecting appropriate perch sites, in addition to their high habitat tolerance, plays an important role allowing them to survive as adults throughout winter. It is confirmed that the libellulids observed here were highly habitat tolerant, common and widespread spp. whose success comes about at least partly from their ability to overwinter and be ready to take advantage of the first rains.

N2  - (17312) FORBES, M.R.L., 1991. Ectoparasites and mating success of male Enallagma ebrium daraselflies (Odonata: Coenagrionidae). Oikos 60(3): 336-342. — (Dept Biol., Carleton Univ., Colonel By Dr., Ottawa, ON, K1S 5B6, CA). Several researchers have found inverse relationships between mating success of d d and degree of parasitism. Whether such mating biases result from 9 choice of parasite-resistant d d as mates, or from parasite-mediated reductions in d competitiveness for access to 9 9, has stimulated considerable discussion. Here it was found that single d E. ebrium were significantly and consistently parasitized by more larval water mites (Arrenurus spp. and Limnochares americana) than were d d caught either in tandem or copula with 9 9. In contrast, d size was inconsistently related to short-term mating success, although there was a consistent negative correlation between d size and mite numbers which was statistically significant on 2 of 7 sampling days. The existence of such natural covariation and its possible effect on d mating success has not been widely discussed. Lastly, it was found that heavilyparasitized d d responded less often to the presence of d models, and took significantly more foraging trips, than did lightly-parasitized d d. Short-term mating biases with respect to ectoparasitism for E. ebrium d d appears to result from reductions in competitiveness of heavily-parasitized d d, for access to 9 9. Furthermore, the results strongly suggest that apparent reductions in competitiveness reflect decisions by heavily-parasitized d d to pursue mating tactics which are energetically inexpensive.

The habitats and larval development stages are described, and a brief overview is presented on the biology, ecology and known distribution in Bhutan, India and Nepal. The sp. inhabits fast running mountain streams in Himalayan broadleaf and subtropical pine forests at an altitude of 1300-2885 m a.s.1. The palaeobiogeographical history of the fossil Epiophlebiidae and Stenophlebiidae and of the 2 extant Epiophlebia spp. is discussed. E. laidlawi is a relict sp., living in headwaters of pristine mountain forests. It is endangered because of human influences, such as deforestation, provision of water power, erosion and other factors. The best protection would be ensured by the conservation of specific habitats in vast protected areas. This has at least partly been put into action in Nepal.

N2  - Evolutionary theory indicates that 3 3 should allocate more resources to increase mating efficiency trading off longevity while 9 9 would actually do the reverse to gain in egg production and laying. One recent hypothesis dictates that these differences would lead 9 9 to invest more in immunity (to increase longevity) than 3 3 (which will invest more in courtship traits). This difference should be more accentuated in spp. whose 9 9 mate multiply, in which 3 3 will invest less to immunity than in spp. where 9 9 mate once. Here, this was tested by using 8 insect spp. with varying sexual selection pressure, that belong to 4 orders. For each order, one sp. was used in which 9 9 accept one (or close to) mating during their life and another in which 9 9 mate multiply. Encapsulation ability, phenoloxidase activity and hydrolytic enzymes were examined. Animals were virgin, sexually mature and well-fed. Comparative analyses provided restricted support as for 9 9 having higher immune values and that this pattern should be more evident in relation to sexual selection intensity when both pairs of spp. per order and all spp. were analyzed. This study calls for a reformulation of current assumptions of immune costs in relation to gender life history differences.

N2  - The study was conducted at the Dos Bocas stream nr Santiago de Cuba, during Aug.-Sept. 2007 (30 d) and in May 2008 (5 d). 3 3 are territorial, defending perching sites and returning to the same place for several days. Sperm translocation lasted about 9 s and copulation about 7.3 min. It consisted of 2 stages, recognized from the position and movements of 3’s abdomen. Stage I took ca 6.6 min and is probably associated with sperm removal. Stage II lasted about 41.3 s, involving probably sperm transfer. Oviposition lasted for just over 1 h; the male guarding his mate during ca 30 min, whereafter he returned to his perch.

N2  - The growing use of pesticides for fishing is a current practice of concern for biodiversity in Eastern Africa. There is little information available, however, on the extent and effect of this practice on conspicuous indicator groups like dragonflies. Odon., especially during the larval stage, are particularly vulnerable to pesticides. This survey found significant differences in both dragonfly abundance and diversity in bays of Lake Victoria that had been fished using pesticides. Only 1-2 dragonfly spp. can be found in areas routinely pesticide-fished in contrast with > 20 spp. in protected areas. This survey highlights the detrimental effect of pesticide fishing on invertebrates.

N2  - Yearly changes in the odonate larval community were surveyed for 4 yr after setting up an artificial reed community adjacent to the original habitat of Mortonagrion hirosei, an endangered brackish water sp. Only M. hirosei larvae were found in the original habitat during the survey period. In the first yr of the established habitat, Ischnura senegalensis was the dominant sp. in the larval community. Although the abundance of M. hirosei larvae increased year by year, becoming the most abundant sp. after the second year, the species composition of the larval community of the established habitat was different between the West and East because of environmental factors, such as saline concentration and reed shoot density. M. hirosei larvae had expanded their distribution to the entire area of the established habitat in 2005, while the distribution of I. senegalensis had been restricted to several patchy areas in accordance with a decrease in their population. There was a negative relationship between the number of M. hirosei and I. senegalensis larvae. The prey-predator relationship and competitive relationship between the 2 spp. should have affected the population dynamics and distribution of M. hirosei. The odonate larval community and habitat environment that is optimal for M. hirosei conservation are discussed from the viewpoint of both biotic and abiotic factors.

N2  - A fine structural overview of the flagellar sensilla of Onychogomphus forcipatus (Gomphidae), Aeshna cyanea (Aeshnidae), Somatochlora metallica (Cordulidae) and Cordulegaster boltonii (Cordulegastridae) revealed the presence of pits containing sensilla typically located on the latero-ventral side of the first flagellar segments in all four species. These sensilla are represented by coeloconic single-walled olfactory sensilla and deeply sunken sensilla styloconica (type-1 and type-2) sharing common features typical of thermo-hygroreceptors. Sensilla styloconica are located inside deep convoluted cavities. It is suggested that olfactory and thermo-hygrosensory sensilla are the main sensilla on the antennae of all anisopteran families. The attribution of the coeloconic sensilla of dragonflies to single-walled olfactory sensilla (confirmed by the finding of pore tubules in O. forcipatus), together with their common occurrence in the suborder Anisoptera, are relevant for phylogenetic studies.

N2  - The wings of 10 C. splendens populations were examined by landmark-based geometric morphometric analysis. Subspecific taxa in this group are currently based on wing spot size in <S 6. Here, the variation in wing shape and size is evaluated, to test whether shape is different at a population level, and whether this has implications at a taxonomic level. It was found that Geometric Morphometries successfully discriminates populations: overall wing shape significantly differed between populations but the results were only partly compatible with taxonomic studies based on wing spot size. Irrespective of wing spot, all populations showed differentiation in wing shape even though not in wing size; 4 groups were recognized based on wing shape: (1) Turkish! population; (2) Spanish, Finnish, Russian and Turkish2 populations; (3) Italian, German and French populations; (4) Greek and Albanian populations. Ordination of the populations based on consensus data and cluster analysis phenogram confirmed such a pattern. The Spanish population (C. xanthostoma), did not show a strong identity, while the Turkish 1 (C. s. waterstoni) was quite isolated. The Italian population (C. s. caprai) showed more relation to the French (C. s. faivrei) and German populations than to Albanian and Greek populations.

N2  - The fine structure of the egg chorion in Brachydiplax sobrina (Ramb.) and Orthetrum s. sabina (Dru.), is described using the scanning electron microscope. The unwetted eggs of B. sobrina are bluish-green and spindle-shaped while those of O. s. sabina are oval and light brown in colour. The egg chorion is distinctly divided into an outer exochorion and an inner tough endochorion. The exochorion expands into a thick, sticky, jelly-like structure in water during oviposition, whereas the endochorion remains unchanged. The endochorion is thin and smooth in O. s. sabina, but in B. sobrina the undersurface of the endochorion is pitted and rough. The apical micropylar apparatus is composed of a sperm storage chamber (atrium) and a median projecting stalk, which possesses a pair of sub-terminal orifices. The atrium in B. sobrina is dome shaped with a tiny stalk whereas in O. s. sabina the micropylar apparatus is triangular with a longer stalk and a pair of almost apically placed orifices. Significant variations occur in the shape and size of the micropylar apparatus. The functional interrelationship of the micro morphological modifications in the chorionic structures is discussed.

N2  - Results of the studies of odonate fauna, carried out in July 2006 in the odonatologically almost unexplored Vasyugan Plain, are presented. The studies concentrated in the northern and northeastern parts of the largest bog in the world, the Vasyugan Bog, and its surroundings. Large primeval complexes of Sphagnum bogs and fens and other accompanying habitats, man-made as well, were studied. 25 localities are briefly described and the occurrence of 35 recorded spp. is commented. Due to almost total absence of typically East Palaearctic spp. (only Shaogomphus postocularis found), the aspect of the odon. fauna in the studied area is similar to a certain degree to that known from central and eastern Europe, but with some differences in the species composition, abundance of many spp. and their habitat preferences. In Coenagrion puella, C. pulchellum, Enallagma risi, Nehalennia speciosa, Gomphus vulgatissimus, Shaogomphus postocularis, Somatochlora flavomaculata, Leucorrhinia albifrons, and L. pectoralis, the northern limit of their distribution appears further N than it was previously known. This suggests that the actual northern range limit of some of these species in W Siberia does not descend as sharply to the S as it was expected. The first known site of S. postocularis W of the Ob’ river and on a perfect plain is also worth noticing. Among the most remarkable discoveries was the regular, area-wide occurrence of several previously poorly known in Siberia spp., such as N. speciosa, Aeshna subarctica, G. vulgatissimus and S. flavomaculata. Taxonomically interesting is the coexistence, in the studied area but not at the same localities, of two taxa considered as subspecies or separate species, E. c. cyathigerum and E. (c.?) risi. The fact of clear spatial separation and at most a minimum degree of intergrading (if any) of these 2 taxa suggests their full species status which would agree with morphological and recent molecular data. The regular and not rare presence of 2 androchrome Calopteryx splendens 9 forms and d 6 with the wings coloured to the tips, as well as the occurrence of brownish wing ‘smoking’ of many 9 S. flavomaculata and S. arctica are peculiar features of the Vasyugan odon. aspect. The 6 segregation in the ‘triangle’ of peat bog aeshnids, Aeshna crenata, A. juncea and A. subarctica, IS described and discussed. Between A.juncea and A. subarctica it was very advanced, partially spatial and partially weather/temporal, between A. crenata and A. subarctica almost complete, spatial, and between A. crenata and A.juncea advanced, weather/ temporal. These observations confirm the dominant position of A. crenata over the water table, and also suggest the lack of crenata-dominance off the water table. The reliability of adult diagnostic features, more and less commonly used to distinguish between A. subarctica and A.juncea, is discussed.

N2  - Interspecific interaction rates and space use were observed for P. lydia at 3 ponds in north-central Texas from June to August 2007. Aggressive interactions of marked individuals were tallied for each interacting sp. by which individual was the aggressor or target and which sp. won or lost. The space used was also mapped. These data were also collected for one individual each of the libellulids Pachydiplax longipennis and Tramea lacerata and compared to P. lydia. Interaction rates were different depending on the category of interacting odon. (perching or flying), supporting the hypothesis that the thermoregulatory categories of perching and flying aid in habitat partitioning among spp.

N2  - Aspects of the N. pygmaea life history, an endangered sp. in Korea, were studied at an abandoned paddy field in Mungyeong, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea. The larvae were sampled quantitatively at monthly intervals (every 2 weeks during the emergence period) from June 2006 to July 2007 and the adults were counted via a line-transect method. Based on the analyses of larval body length distribution, degree days (DD), and emergence time, the sp. is considered univoltine with an emergence period from mid-May to early August. The estimated sum of the thermal amount, effective to larval development during the study period, was 2468 DD. The relationship between the larval head width and wingsheath width, which is coincident with the temperature fluctuation pattern, shows that the population harbors at least 4 size groups (cohorts) in a generation.

Virgin d 3 reared separately from 9 9 showed no preference between sexes or between morphs, suggesting that virgin 3 3 were unable to recognize potential mates and had no innate mating preference for a particular 9 morph. After enclosure with a single 9 in a small cage, 3 3 that had experienced copulation significantly preferred the same 9 morph with which they had copulated, while 3 3 that failed to copulate with the 2 showed no preference. The 6 6 that had experienced copulation significantly preferred $ 2 over 3 3. Therefore, ability of d S to discriminate between sexes and morphs was confirmed by their copulation experience.

N2  - Mortality during emergence was studied at an open drain in the city of Nagpur (central India). The total mortality rate (MR) was 10.92% (n = 686). Failure to moult (incomplete emergence state, MR = 4.8%) and failure to expand abdomen and harden wings for flight (complete emergence state, MR = 6.12%) were the two major reasons of mortality. The emerging dragonflies failed to moult and were found dead in the following conditions: cuticle of the thorax split and head and thorax of the pharate partly out of the exuviae (MR = 2.04%), head, thorax and wings out but the entire abdomen trapped in the exuviae (MR = 2.76%). After complete moulting some pharates were found floating, dead or completely exhausted in the water body. Some of the dead pharates had a curved telescopic abdomen and crumpled (MR = 0.44%), or stretched wings (MR = 2.33%), while others exhibited a straight, expanded abdomen and stretched overlapping (MR = 1.75%) or stretched spread wings (MR = 1.60%). Death due to overcrowding and predation was negligible. Statistical analysis revealed that mortality is independent of stage of emergence (P = 0.25).

N2  - At a location in southern Spain (nr Vejer de la Frontera, Rio Barbate valley, Andalusia), observations were made on a local population of ca 40 B. leucostica individuals, a sp, known for its inclination to accompany large mammals (the test subject was a human). The goal of the tests was to ascertain how far they are willing to accompany a large mammal, whether the size of the group has an influence on the distance for accompanying the subject and whether the accompaniment differs between sexes. Accompanying a person was recorded in 53 cases, involving 41 S and 83 $ dragonflies. They generally flew at a height of 10-50 cm above the ground in front of the moving person, distributed in a semicircle with a radius of 1-2 m (the maximum observed group size was 11 dragonflies). Group size did not influence the flight range of the last individual or the detachment of the first individual from the group, as the dragonflies broke away at random. The average distance of accompaniment by 5 2 (38.4 m) was further than that by d 6 (23.9 m). The maximum path of accompaniment was 89 m for 6 6 and 111 m for $ 9. After detaching from the person, the dragonflies returned to the shade. Only rarely did $ ? settle on open pasture, and then just for a brief period. In 3 cases (i.e. 1.6%), hunting of prey stirred up from the pasture by the person was observed.

N2  - Using exuviae, data are presented on emergence dates of dragonflies from northern Sweden and northwestern Poland. The 17 spp. sampled in Sweden showed considerable overlap in emergence periods. In Sweden, Leucorrhinia rubicunda was the first sp. to emerge (May 31) and Sympetrum danae the last (July 19). A comparison of first dates of emergence of spp. in Sweden and Poland showed a difference between 9 and 30 days, with all Polish spp. emerging first. Compared to spring species, summer species and obligate univoltine summer species showed less difference in first date of emergence between Swedish and Polish populations. In a laboratory experiment Leucorrhinia dubia was reared from both regions from the egg to final instar larva under northern Swedish and northwestern Polish photoperiods. Swedish larvae developed faster under a northern Swedish photoperiod compared to a northwestern Polish photoperiod. However, no such difference in development was found for northwestern Polish larvae. This suggests that there are genetic differences between both populations in response to photoperiod. The results are discussed in the context of compensation of larval development of northern populations in relation to photoperiod.

N2  - Compared to other insect groups, libellulids have a rather high mean number of ovarioles. In addition, the mean ovariole diameter differs greatly between and within species. In general, 2 different types of ovariole arrangement exist: (1) all developing oocytes mature and equal in size; in some species without, and in others with, surrounding connective tissue and (2) oocytes displaying gradual maturation, with only the outermost ovarioles mature. These differences have ecological consequences; the first arrangement occurs in spp. that have stepwise egg production. These spp. will lay one or more clutches, after which an interclutch interval of ovariole regrowth follows. Spp. with the second arrangement have continuous egg production and are able to lay at least some eggs all the time, reducing the length of interclutch intervals. However, no direct connection between mate-guarding strategies and ovariole arrangements can be seen. Nevertheless, it is believed that the process of ovariole maturation differs between these groups. It is concluded that ovary morphology in libellulids may exhibit evolutionary fixed traits, although the whole picture still remains complex. The ovariole arrangement may have a crucial impact on the reproductive ecology of the species.

N2  - Mining modifies the surrounding environment and causes habitat deterioration along river systems receiving mine tailings. Here it is assessed whether chromium ore mining affects the odon. abundance and diversity. Line transect surveys were conducted during 4 months at the Henry river (along a pristine section and a previously mined section), and at the Lecing river, which is currently receiving tailings from chromium ore mines. The density of adult odon. was 10 times higher in the pristine than in the mined river. Species richness was reduced in both the currently and in the previously mined sections (5 spp.) as compared to that of the pristine river (12 spp.), showing a detrimental effect of chromium mining on dragonfly diversity and abundance.

N2  - The chain of events occurring during emergence in P. flavescens is described in detail. The moulting process is divided into 3 stages. The larva climbs out of the water a few hours after sunset. If disturbed while climbing, it exhibits thanatosis i.e. death feigning and crab-like side-ways crawling. It stops at a suitable vertical emergent support. Manipulation from vertical to horizontal of this support stops commencement of ecdysis. — Stage I starts from the moment the larva finds a suitable site for moulting. Soon, it starts shuddering, quivering and shaking its body in a synchronized pattern. The imago inside the exuviae exerts pressure on the thoracic tergites until the cuticle splits. This stage varies from 8 to 20 min and occupies 16% of the moulting period. — During stage II, the head and thorax of the imago emerge out of the split thoracic cuticle. The imago exhibits an antero-posterior humping movement and the body hangs out downwards with folded legs. The half suspended, upturned imago starts ‘breathing’ heavily. Unfolding of the legs and movements of the packed wings takes place in a characteristic manner. The imago turns upwards, grips the head of the exuviae and jerks out the remaining terminal portion of the abdomen from the exuviae. This stage takes 18 to 35 min and occupies 31% of the moulting time. Pigmentation of the head region is completed during this stage. — In stage III, the imago is released from the exuviae, it starts hardening its cuticle and extending the wings. The imago moves a few inches above the exuviae. The abdomen is pale green and curved upwards. The wings expand but are opaque. Simultaneously, pigmentation of the body starts around the thoracic region and the terminal tip of the abdomen. Within 10-14 min the whole body of the imago develops a species-specific teneral pattern of colouration. Meanwhile, the expanding wings unfold and separate out and the teneral adult is ready for flight. This stage takes 40-55 min and occupies 53% of the total moulting period. Observations on incomplete metamorphosis indicate that gravitational force is responsible for uniform wing expansion.

N2  - I. senegalensis 9 9 exhibit colour dimorphism as andromorphs and gynomorphs, to which males seem to switch their mate preference according to prior copulation experience. In the field where andromorphs were dominant, the binary choice experiments were conducted both in the early morning, which marks the onset of daily copulation activity, and in the afternoon, which marks the end of the copulation activity. During the former period, S 6 showed fair selectivity, while they preferred the andromorphs in the afternoon, suggesting that S mate preference to each 9 morph switched in relation to copulation experience; i.e. the mating attempts of <J 6 were biased to the dominant 9 morph. Mating attempts in the afternoon were considered to inhibit 9 oviposition behaviour, resulting in a decrease of her reproductive success. Therefore, biased <J mate choice toward the dominant morph in the afternoon might be a selective force to maintain the 9 colour dimorphism.

Multivariate statistical procedures were used to analyse the relationship between the spp. and the characteristics of their habitat, in order to determine different spp. biotope preferences, Aside from spp. with unspecific habitat requirements, 2 main species assemblages could be detected. Enallagma cyathigerum, Sympetrum fonscolombeii, S. sanguineum, Ischnura pumilio, Lestes virens and Anax imperator preferred permanent water bodies characterized by high temperatures, while Calopteryx virgo, Pyrrhosoma nymphula, Cordulegaster boltonii and Onychogomphus uncatus preferred sites with fast-flowing water characterized by low and moderate temperatures. Conservation strategies should take these patterns and habitat requirements into consideration.

The results of the x2 test supported the 9 -biased sex ratio in populations of all 3 spp. The sex ratio in populations varied significantly in time during the emergence season, caused by the fact that all 3 spp. demonstrated a significant protandric trend. The greatest changes in sex ratio during the emergence season were demonstrated by G. flavipes (coefficient value -0.007542); the smallest were recorded in G. vulgatissimus (CV -0.008617).

N2  - Odonates exhibit a variety of weather associated behaviours, including abandoning ponds just before storms begin. They may be able to detect changes in weather that alert them to approaching storms and allow them to escape the water’s edge before it begins to rain. E. annexum and E. boreale were observed at a Colorado marsh (USA) to determine which weather factors contributed to the weather-induced behaviours they exhibit. They were observed for 191 five-minute periods and their flight activity quantified. Weather parameters were measured during each interval to account for rapid changes in conditions. Based on results from multiple regression analysis, it is clear that light intensity is the strongest weather parameter affecting zygopteran flight activity, but temperature, wind speed, and the presence of rain are also significant. The 2 spp. exhibited pond abandonment behaviour during storms. It is likely that storms are dangerous to zygopterans and their apparent ability to detect impending storms is a survival mechanism. Alternatively, pond abandonment behaviour may be triggered by the same factors necessary to trigger roosting and the zygopterans simply return to their roosting sites during storms.

N2  - Scanning electron microscope studies of the antennal flagella of Coenagrion puella and Ischnura elegans (Coenagrionidae), Platycnemis pennipes (Platycnemididae), Lestes barbarus, L. viridis (Lestidae), Calopteryx virgo and C. haemorrhoidalis (Calopterygidae) reveal the presence of pits containing sensilla on the latero-ventral side of the antenna. All these pits are the opening of deep cavities bearing the same sensilla previously described on Anisoptera antennae. These sensilla are represented by: (i) coeloconic porous sensilla, visible on the antennal surface, whose structure is in agreement with that reported for single walled olfactory receptors, and by (ii) two types of sensilla styloconica (type-1 and type-2), located at the bottom of the cavities and sharing common features typical of thermo-hygroreceptors. The present data allow us to extend previous considerations on the sensory role of the dragonfly antennae to the whole order Odonata, suggesting that olfaction, together with the ability to perceive temperature and humidity, are the main sensory functions of the antennae of these insects.

N2  - According to the movements of the 6 abdomen, the copulation process in I. asiatica is divided into 3 stages (I, II and III). The mean duration of each stage was 75.8 ± 8.8 min, 6.4 ± 0.3 min and 15.8 ± 0.9 min for stage I, II and III, respectively (S.E.). No sperm transfer was found during stage I. The prolonged duration in stage 1 was related to the time of onset of copulation. Sperm was transferred into the bursa copulatrix during stage II. Although stage III was a phase without apparent abdominal movement, the sperm transfer was continued, following the sperm migration from the bursa copulatrix to the spermatheca. Immediately after copulation termination, the estimated number of sperm was 64,500 ± 4,425 in the bursa copulatrix and 43,143 ± 6,397 in the spermatheca (S.E.). The role of each stage in copulation will be discussed from the viewpoint of sperm competition.

N2  - The odon. larval assemblage from Rio Pinolapa (RP) in the municipality of Tepalcatepec, Michoacan, is described. Sampling was conducted twice in each season (8 trips in total), and additionally some physicochemical variables of the river channel were recorded. Strata (shores, riffles and eddies) and seasonal variation of assemblages are described and compared using classical diversity measures such as Shannon’s diversity index, Simpson’s diversity index as a dominance measure, Margalef’s richness index and Pielou’s evenness index. For comparing strata and seasonal diversity the Renyi’s diversity profiles were used. A Cluster Analysis was performed on a Bray-Curtis similarity matrix to explore the faunal relationships among year seasons and strata. CCA was also performed to investigate the relationships between the physicochemical and species abundance matrixes. As results, 28 spp. (12 Zygoptera and 16 Anisoptera) were recorded as larvae. Most abundant species were Erpetogomphus elaps, Brechmorhoga praecox and Phyllogomphoides luisi. The highest number of spp. was registered in winter and the lowest in summer. Among strata the highest abundance was recorded in riffles, although the shoreline had the largest number of spp. The most similar assemblages were those of autumn and winter. Shore habitats were more heterogeneous than eddies and riffles and this could explain the larger number of species. The Clench’s model explains better the data. Additionally, we used the slope of cumulative number of spp. curve for assessing completeness of the RP list. CCA was significant, with pH, autumn, shoreline and riffles the most important variables. This means that species variation is related to physicochemical, temporal and strata conditions in RP.

N2  - Eugregarine parasites infect a wide variety of invertebrates. Some authors suggest that eugregarines are rather harmless, but recent studies suggest otherwise. Among odonate-eugregarine investigations, Zygoptera have been more frequently studied than Anisoptera. Adult dragonfly populations were surveyed for eugregarines at a constructed, flow-through wetland system and the fitness cost of infection was assessed in a common and widespread dragonfly host sp., E. simplicicollis. Populations were sampled weekly throughout the flight season. Host fitness parameters measured included wing load, egg size, clutch size, and total egg count. Of the 22 host spp. surveyed, 8 hosted eugregarines and 2 of these odon. spp. were previously undocumented as hosts. While eugregarine parasitism has been shown to exhibit seasonality, parasite prevalence and intensity in E. simplicicollis in this study showed no seasonal trend. The fitness parameters measured were not correlated with the presence or intensity of eugregarines. These findings suggest that either eugregarines do not affect wing loading and egg production in E. simplicicollis, or that virulence depends on parasite intensity and/or the specific eugregarine spp. infecting the hosts.

N2  - The endangered M. hirosei perches in the understory of dense reed communities in brackish water. To aid the conservation of a population, a new reed community (2110 m2) was established in abandoned rice paddy fields adjacent to the original, threatened community (500 m2) by transplanting reed rhizomes in January 2003; brackish water was supplied to the new community. It was assessed whether the new community developed into a suitable habitat for M. hirosei by comparing it to the original community in 2005. Shoot height, density, and aboveground biomass of the reeds and relative light intensity in the community were measured periodically during the growing season. Reed height and biomass were significantly lower in the new community than in the original one. This suggests that 3 yr after transplantation the new community was still underdeveloped. However, shoot density and relative light intensity in the understory were not significantly different between the two communities. Thus, the new reed community was offered in 2005 to M. hirosei adults as a suitable habitat.

N2  - (18062) DE MARCO, P., Jr, 1992. Community structure and co-occurrence of larval odonate species: a morphological approach. Tese Mestre Cien. Biol., Univ. Campinas, ix+80 pp. (Port., with Engl. s.). — (Lab. Ecol. Teoretica, Depto Biol, Geral, Univ. Fed. de Goias, BR-74001-970 Goiania, GO). Studies on odon. larvae have shown the existence of feeding territories, suggesting that competition for foraging patches may be an important factor in community structuring. Field studies however have failed to demonstrate competition, and have suggested that fish predation and cannibalism among larvae are important regulating factors. Here, the co-occurrence patterns among larvae in several aquatic plants are examined in order to evaluate the importance of these interactive processes to the explanation of the observed patterns. Odon. were sampled on aquatic plants in the states of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo (Brazil). 14 measures were taken of the body, head and labium of each individual. Cluster analysis showed 2 types of communities associated with macrophytes of distinct architecture. The submerged Egeria densa, Myriophyllum brasiliense and the emergent Eleocharis mutata had Ischnura fluviatilis, Micrathyria hesperis, Erythrodiplax sp. and Acanthagrion sp. as dominants, whereas the floating Eichhomia crassipes and Salvinia sp. were dominated by Miathyria simplex and Telebasis filiola. The morphometry data demonstrated convergence within the sets. The spp. characteristic of floating plants have greater eye width and smaller anterior, medium and posterior femur length, when compared to the spp. living in submerged and emergent macrophytes. In order to test the importance of interactive processes as determinants of the morphological patterns of cooccurring spp. (limited similarity hypothesis), null models were built representing the expected patterns if the communities were assembled through random selection from the sampled spp. The Egeria densa community showed smaller morphometric distances among spp. than that expected by chance, suggesting convergence mechanisms in relation to possible colonizing morphologies. The larvae in Myriophyllum brasiliense tended to separate more than expected by chance, suggesting an effect of interspecific competition. The consistency between 2 different null model constructions was an interesting way to evaluate the behaviour of the statistical test, in the identification of non-random patterns, ft is suggested as an important methodological approach.
