N2  - Bayview is a bushland suburb of Sydney situated on the southern shores of Pittwater and approximately 20 miles north of the city. The following notes concern the capture of three butterfly species rarely observed in the Sydney district, the Evening Brown, 'Melanitis leda bankia' (Fabricius), the Pale Green Triangle, 'Graphium eurypylus lycaon' (C. and R. Felder) and the small Green-banded Blue, 'Danis hymetus taygetus' (C. and R. Felder).

The name is now applied to this part of the Claudie River district. The area contains tropical rain forest which is isolated from other areas of rain forest to the south and at the northern end of the peninsula. The dragonflies listed below were collected in the northern section of this rain forest along the road leading to Portland Roads between the Coen turnoff and the northern limit of the forest. Only incidental collecting of dragonflies was carried out, however, this not being the main purpose of the visit.

N2  - Webs of many argiopid species show slight to marked modifications of what might be regarded as a 'typical' orb web, but the methods of construction are basically similar. However, some of the procedures used by 'Poecilopctchys austrolasia', and certain characteristics of its finished orb web, differ markedly from those of any other species known to the author. Goodwin (1961) observes that this species makes an "irregular web", but does not make any specific reference to its structure. She also refers to its retreat position "on the under surface of a leaf".

Bolivar varies from colourless to deep pink, and Rehn (1953) suggested that the variation might be due to some environmental factor or 'to physiological factors in the ontogeny of the individual'. During a brief stay in Queensland in September 1972 some observations were made on this species which indicate that his second supposition is the correct one.

N2  - Chequered beetles of the exclusively Australian genus 'Zenithicola' Spinola may be recognised by their compact build and broad, triangular elytra. They are attractive insects that are often found on blossom and so have been relatively well collected and recorded but as far as I am aware, nothing has been published concerning their life-histories. It was therefore of special interest to rear adults of 'Z. crassus' (Newm.) recently, from larvae found with termites at Cape Pallarenda, near Townsville (N. Qld), in July, 1972.

The average rainfall is 63 cm (25 inch) and the soil is poor, resulting in a light vegetative cover consisting notably of eucalypts, macrozamias and grasses including spinifex ('Triodia'). Scattered table-topped hills surround the township and close by to the north west the larger and more rugged Mt. Zamia dominates the skyline. From this protrudes a large rock known locally as Virgin Rock, the top of which rises some 245 metres (800 ft) above the town. It was on Mt. Zamia, and in particular from the top of Virgin Rock, that many of the butterflies listed below were taken.

N2  - Studies on population movements of butterflies, especially 'Danaus plexippus' (L.), have been under way since 1963, during which time many specimens have been marked and released using the "alar tag" method of Urquhart (1960). From the periods recorded between release and recapture an indication of possible length of life in the field can be obtained. Since little seems to have been published on this aspect of butterfly biology in Australia it has been decided to record the data so far available. As the marking programme was not designed to provide such data its limitations should be borne in mind. The specimens were nearly all captured in the field, marked and released although some were reared from the larval stage. Most, therefore, had been in flight for an unknown period before marking and many were still active when recaptured so having an expectancy of further life. Many were released again after the serial number on the tag had been noted.

N2  - Male butterflies of the subfamily Danainae have a pair of expansible, pheromone-disseminating organs (hairpencils) near the tip of the abdomen. When expanded the hairpencils give off a characteristic scent. Edgar 'et al.' (1971, 1973) have found that several danaids from Australia and the New Hebrides secrete on their hairpencils dihydropyrrolizines which are chemically related to the pyrrolizidine alkaloids. There is evidence to suggest (Edgar 'et al.', 1973) that the male butterflies obtain their hairpencil dihydropyrrolizines from pyrrolizidine alkaloid-containing plants by adult feeding.

N2  - Mendooran is approximately 290 kilometres (180 miles) north-west of Sydney and 72 kilometres (45 miles) north-east of Dubbo. The area is virtually flat, the elevation being approximately 360 metres (1200 ft). The vegetation consists mainly of scattered eucalypt forest with scrubby undergrowth and cleared open plains. The rainfall is low, averaging only 57 cm (22 1/2 in) per annum. During recent years I have had the opportunity of collecting butterflies in this area, collecting at irregular intervals over a period of 7 years from 1966 to 1973. However, to date, no collecting has been undertaken during June. There appear to be no previous records of butterflies from this area and no doubt further species will be found and months of occurrence for known species extended after further collecting.

N2  - This paper consists of a list of positive identifications of species collected or observed by the author between 1970 and 1974. The locality of capture or observation is followed by a number indicating the month in which the species was recorded (i.e. January = 1, February = 2, etc.). The symbols nl, si, and wl. indicate that the species at that locality is at the known northern, southern or western limit of its distribution. In general, the list includes localities of captures not previously recorded for each species. Those butterflies regarded as common or widespread within Queensland are omitted. The list does not include Hesperiidae of the subfamily Hesperiinae. Species of this group captured between 1970 and 1974 are being evaluated and will be the subject of another list to be published at a later date.

N2  - Dense, milling swarms of small insects were a conspicuous feature of the Canberra district during the closing weeks of the 1974-75 summer. Whenever present such swarms were located at considerable heights and usually in the lee of tall eucalypts, the tips of which they were evidently using as selected markers. These insects persisted in their activity under quite windy conditions, when their billowing movements created an illusion of smoke issuing from the treetops.

During the latter part I saw a few examples of 'Vanessa kershawi' (McCoy) flying through the University of Tasmania campus on occasional sunny days. On October 5th, 4 worn, somewhat faded specimens were taken and on October 11th 3 very worn and faded individuals were collected, while 'Precis villida calybe' (Godart) in contrast was common and fresh.

N2  - 'Librella demetrius' n. gen. et sp. is described from eastern Australia. A detailed morphological comparison with certain other acalyptrate flies is made, and it is suggested that 'Librella' is a highly plesiomorphic ('sensu' Hennig) member of the family Cryptochetidae. Though this relationship is not obvious from comparison with the recent genus 'Cryptochetum' Rondani, it is more apparent when the Oligocene cryptochetid genus 'Phanerochaetum' Hennig is considered. The Cryptochetidae are perhaps best placed in the superfamily Drosophiloidea despite some points of disagreement with other included families.

The few facts then known were summarised by Roberts (1928a: 92), and a few other records were added in the course of his revision of the family (Roberts 1928a, b; 1929). A very brief summary was given by Colless and McAlpine (1970), to which I can now add records of two undescribed species of 'Cyrtornorpha' (held in the Aust. National Insect Collection) reared from grasshopper egg-pods; also, of several larvae, possibly of Bombyliidae, found in tunnels made by Hymenoptera (probably bees) in the walls of a termite mound. It is strange, though, that we seem to know precisely nothing about the large subfamilies Lomatinae and Bombyliinae that make up the bulk of our fauna.

N2  - Observations of the behaviour of 'Papilio demoleus sthenelus' W. S. Mackay in south-west Western Australia are reported. This butterfly is a spasmodic visitor to the Perth metropolitan area where it occasionally breeds on 'Citrus'. The migratory nature of the species is reaffirmed and discussed.

N2  - On grounds of present climate and of presumed past glacial history, the extensive cave-systems of the Snowy Mountains might appear to be the most likely locality in mainland Australia to support a diverse and closely adapted arthropod fauna (Moore 1972) yet despite considerable exploration by biologically orientated speleologists, few such species have been discovered and in particular, the paucity of carabid beetles is both puzzling and disappointing. In effect, the present record of a new species of 'Teraphis' Castelnau provides the first instance of a clearly cave-adapted carabid from the region and also, the first occurrence anywhere of a cavernicolous member of the subfamily Psydrinae. The discovery is therefore of special interest.

N2  - The diurnal Cineraria moth ['Nycternera amica' (White)] is fairly common in southern and eastern Australia. Population movements of this species have not, apparently, been recorded although Seitz (1890) mentions that it is sometimes seen off the Australian coast thus implying deliberate flights or wind borne displacement.

N2  - As long ago as the early spring of 1959, I collected a series of a medium-sized and apparently unremarkable harpaline carabid beetle from several localities in southwestern Western Australia. In the field, and upon later cursory examination, the specimens passed for a species of the large and difficult native genus 'Diaphoromerus' Chaudoir and they were set aside with other unidentified material of the group. However, upon close study, later, the adhesive tarsal vestiture of the males was seen to be of the biseriately squamose type, characteristic of the tribe Harpalini, rather than the uniformly spongiose type that is found in the Anisodactylini, to which 'Diaphoromerus' and most others of the larger Australian Harpalinae belong. At that time, the only known Australian genus of Harpalini was 'Phorticosomus' Schaum, where most of some 20 species have secondarily lost the tarsal vestiture, but the Oriental 'Coleolissus' Bates has since been recorded (Moore, 1967; Darlington, 1968) in two species, from Cape York Peninsula.

N2  - Psocids, also known as Barklice or Booklice (order Psocoptera) are small insects, from less than a millimetre to 10 millimetres in length. They are usually recognised in the field by their characteristic appearance which is due to the rounded, mobile head, enlarged thorax and the wings, which are held roofwise over the abdomen. The antennae are long and fine, composed of many segments, with thirteen being the most usual number. There are few brightly coloured species; most are yellowish, brownish, grey or black in general appearance. On close examination, however, many have distinct body markings and in some species striking and complex wing patterns are found.

N2  - The Australian psyllid fauna is characterized by the large proportion of species that have evolved with the Myrtaceae (species of Spondyliaspidae) and Mimosaceae (species of Psyllidae). The New Zealand fauna, on the other hand, is dominated by species of 'Trioza' Forster on Compositae (especially on species of 'Olearia' Moench and 'Senecio' L.). The faunas share a number of common species but the majority of these are Australian ones that have been introduced into New Zealand on their Australian host plants.

N2  - In a recent paper (Moulds, 1977) the known distribution of 'Tisiphone helena' (Olliff) was significantly extended, principally to the north. Mission Beach (between Innisfail and Tully) has remained the known southern limit for this butterfly species. I wish to record now a new southern locality.

N2  - The butterfly 'Vagrans egista' (Cramer) is widespread through the Indo-Australian region with several races being recognised. The Australian subspecies, 'V. e. propinqua' (Miskin), is recorded from a relatively small area of northern Queensland; Claudie River (Iron Range), Mossman and Cairns to Ingham (Common and Waterhouse, 1972; D'Abrera, 1971; Monteith, 1972).

This larva, tentatively identified as that of 'Austroneurorthus' sp., was later found to be closely similar to the aquatic larva of the European 'Neurorthus fallax' (Rambur) described by Zwick (1967) (Riek, 1974). Nothing further has been published on the habitat or relationships of the Australian forms.

These two families stand in strong contrast to the Pieridae of which almost half of the 31 Australian species have been suggested or confirmed as migrants.

N2  - 'Uresiphita ornithopteralis' (Guenee), commonly called the Tree Lucerne Moth (McCallan, 1973), is indigenous to Tasmania occurring on several food plants. Although of only minor pest status, the moth may cause severe damage by the defoliation of garden shrubs and plants. Species of 'Cytisus', particularly 'C. proliferus' L. (Tree Lucerne), and the many varieties of 'Genista' (Brooms) grown in gardens as ornamental shrubs, are subject to attack. 'U. ornithopteralis' was first described by Guenee (1857) who placed it in the genus 'Mecyna'.

N2  - The nominate species 'Euploea callithoe' Boisduval and 'Euploea phaenareta' (Schaller), although treated as conspeciflc by Corbet (1942, 1943), have been regarded as distinct by other authors (Carpenter, 1953; D'Abrera, 1971). Evidence based on the immature stages suggests that the races of these supposed species, which occur in New Britain and New Guinea, are conspecific but may be specifically distinct from the more western subspecies assigned by Corbet to 'E. phaenareta'.

A large number of ant samples was sent to the Biological and Chemical Research Institute for identification and over approximately eight years a sizeable collection was built up. The three commonest species received were 'Iridomyrmex darwinianus' (Forel), 'Technomyrmex albipes' (F. Smith) and 'Pheidole megacephala' (F.).

N2  - These notes are based on specimens captured in the vicinity of a large permanent marsh, in the South Black Range, at an altitude of approximately 1200 m, 8 km due east of Hoskinstown. The Black Range is a section of the Great Dividing Range lying about 45 km east by south-east of Canberra and is separated from the coastal range by the Shoalhaven River valley. To the north of Black Range the altitude of the Dividing Range falls sharply to about 760 m in the area of Lakes George and Bathurst. To the south the Dividing Range maintains an altitude of 1100 - 1220 m as far as the Brown Mountain area where it turns westward and again drops to an altitude of about 760 m near Cooma. The ranges between Black Range and Brown Mountain are separated from the Tinderry Mountains immediately to the west by the lower, drier valleys of the Queanbeyan and Bredbo Rivers.

Surprisingly, the list did not include any species of 'Ectopsocus' McLachlan, a large, cosmopolitan genus some species of which have a very widespread distribution. Some develop very large populations, the usual habitat for the genus being dried leaves or leaf Utter. Collecting in 1977 revealed the presence on Lord Howe of 'Ectopsocus punctatus' Thornton and Wong (1968) which was beaten from dried leaves. 'E. punctatus' was described from New Zealand and is known to occur also in eastern Australia (Smithers, 1977).

Fourteen species are stream dwellers, and all but one of these have southern affinities. The gorge is the northernmost known locality of two of these southern species. Six species occur in the tributaries but not in the main gorge; two of these are known only from the Carnarvon Gorge area, and the other four show minor differences from their counterparts elsewhere in Australia.

N2  - Mount Kaputar National Park is situated approximately 420 km NNW of Sydney and some 50 km E of Narrabri. The Kaputar plateau is the highest area of the Nandewar Range and forms the major part of the Park. This high and deeply dissected plateau rises abruptly from the north-west plains and represents the eroded remnants of an ancient volcano. Much of the Park has a rich soil derived from the volcanic parent rock and this supports a luxuriant flora. Dry sclerophyll forest covers the bulk of the Park and many of the high tops support large stands of snow gum ('Eucalyptus pauciflord') and tea tree ('Leptospermum' sp.).

It is here placed in the monotypic subgenus 'Eleppone' nov., being most closely allied to South American 'Heraclides' Hubner and Indo-Papuan 'Chilasa' Moore. Larval morphology and foodplant preferences of ancestral Papilionidae are discussed: "the ancestral larva" is considered to have been smooth and green; ancestral Leptocircini, Troidini and Papilionini are suggested to have fed on Annonaceae, Aristolochiaceae and Rutaceae respectively.

N2  - Tillyard (1922) gave an interesting account of the search for and discovery of the larva of 'Ithone fusca' Newman. He described the egg, larva and pupa and gave information on the duration of the stages. His anatomical researches suggested that the larva, like all other known neuropterous larvae, took only liquid food. He decided, by a process of elimination, that the food of larval 'Ithone' was scarab larvae and wrote ('loc. cit.' p. 222): "I have not actually succeeded in seeing an 'Ithone' larva attack any of its victims, but have no doubt that it is done by an upward stroke, judging by the formation of its mouth-parts"

N2  - The introduced weed 'Emex australis' is attacked by the native weevil 'Rhinoncus australis'. Adult 'R. australis' fed on all plant parts except roots, mature fruits and male flowers. Most eggs (83%) were deposited in pits in stems, petioles and developing fruit. The larvae tunnelled actively in stems, petioles and the pericarp of young fruit. Pupation occurred in chambers inside stems. &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62; Adult males lived as many as 245 days, females 191 days, and as many as 579 eggs were laid. The average time between generations, i.e. the time from emergence of one adult to the emergence of its progeny is 45 days (range 38-53). &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62; Under insectary conditions 'R. australis' retarded growth and seed production of 'E. australis'. Field populations of 'R. australis' increased in spring and early summer but were never large enough to affect growth or seed production of the weed.

'Ectropa' is preoccupied and was renamed 'Apotropina' Hendel, 1907, and this name antedates the well known names 'Lasiopleura' and 'Parahippetates', the former in particular recorded from all faunal regions.

N2  - On the available eviuence it seems likely that the larva of 'Chaoborus' normally, but perhaps optionally, voids the remains of its prey by everting the crop. For other chaoborid genera the evidence is less convincing, and crop eversion, as seen in specimens, may be only an artefact of preservation.

N2  - The 'Pachliopta polydorus' group of swallowtails is shown to be closely related to the 'Atrophaneura coon' group. The relationship between these two groups and other species of 'Atrophaneura' is such that recognition of 'Pachliopta' and 'Atrophaneura' as separate genera results in a paraphyletic classification. 'Pachliopta' Reakkt is thus reinstated as a synonym of 'Atrophaneura' Reakirt. 'Atrophaneura' is shown to be distinct from 'Parides' Hubner at the generic level.

The only parasite reared out of instar III and older larvae was the tachinid 'Sturmia convergens' (Weid.). Levels of parasitism ranged from 11% to 100%. Time of year and the size of the food plant patch strongly influenced levels of parasitism, being lowest in winter and in larvae found on isolated plants.

N2  - In his review of the Australian Muscidae, Pont (1973) decided that the species previously known as, 'Musca hicens' Villeneuve had irf fact never been formally described; in his opinion Villeneuve's description refers to another species ('Musca conducens' Walker). Pont therefore supplied a full description and the name 'Musca cassara', He recorded the species from various parts of the Oriental Region, the Solomon Islands, and Prince of Wales Island in Torres Strait; but he found no evidence that it occurs on the Australian mainland.

N2  - A large larval colony of 'Ogyris genoveva' gela Waterhouse was found near Canberra in April, 1979, in a nest of the sugar ant 'Camponotus consobrinus' (Erichson) at the base of a eucalypt. Larvae were clustered on the trunk at the nest entrance and others were sheltering beneath a rock at the base of the tree. The rock could not be replaced securely so the colony was covered by pieces of bark.

N2  - The plants, ants and certain epigaeic invertebrates were sampled on the banks of the Canning Dam reservoir which had become exposed as a result of several years drought. &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62; At least 26 plant and 17 ant species had colonised the reservoir banks within 67 months of exposure. All but three ants present were also residents of the adjacent forest. Most were generalist feeders which nested in soil or subterranean dead wood. The ant species present took between about 1.5 and 67 months to colonise the banks. The species composition of ants was very similar to those recolonising nearby bauxite mined areas.

N2  - The scale insect 'Pulvinariella mesembryanthem; is host specific to the succulent 'Carpobrotus edulis', is tended by a range of ant species and is eaten by a species of coccinellid beetle. The host plant, scale and predators are exotic to Western Australia but the ants are native. Compared with control samples, more scale insects died when ants were removed and this appeared to be due to sooty mould infestation. The removal of predators had little effect on scale survivorship. For all treatments some scale survived to contribute offspring to the next generation. Independence from ants would allow this scale to colonize new areas but the formation of large populations of scale probably depends upon the presence of ants.

Altogether nine "dendrolimnetobiontic" species are recorded: a chironomid, a ceratopogonid, two species of culicid, an helodid. three species of mite and a frog. All species spend their immatwe life in tree holes and, in addition, adult mites and, on one occasion, frogs were encountered. The trophic relations of the species concerned are discussed and are placed in context of work done 'elsewhere.

Mounds of excavated soil thrown up by this tunnelling activity interfere with play on local golf courses. Some details are given of the feeding behaviour of the beetles.

N2  - The sphecid 'Prionyx saevus' (Smith) is recorded parasitising the Australian plague locust, 'Chortoicetes terminifera' (Walker), in western New South Wales during an outbreak in 1979. Observations on nesting behaviour are given and evidence is presented of possible migration with host swarms. The inquiline 'Protomiltogramma cincta' Townsend is recorded infesting a high proportion of hosts at one 'P. saevus' nesting site. Despite the cohspicuous activity of 'P. saevus' described, it is concluded that 'P. saevus' caused an insignificant reduction of host numbers during the outbreak.

N2  - Butterflies may lay their eggs on species of plant which are unsuitable as sources of food for their larvae. This has led to some misleading records in the secondary literature. This contention is illustrated by detailed treatment of three examples: 'Euploea core/Asclepias' spp., 'Cressida cressida/Aristolochia elegans' and 'Danaus plexippus/Araufia hortorum'. The reasons why such 'mistakes' in oviposition occur and their coevolutionary history is discussed.

Each is defined as far as available data allow and species for each listed where feasible in an attempt to reduce some of the confusion surrounding these genera. A neotypc is designated for 'Copustigma maculiceps' Enderlein, the type species of 'Clematostigma. Tanystigma' gen. nov. and 'Tiliapsocus' gen. nov. are proposed as genera to hold species which cannot be retained as being congeneric with the type species of 'Clematostigma'.

N2  - Polymorphism in body colour of mature larvae in 'Zizina labradus' (Godart) ranging from white to red, green and dark purple became apparent upon rearing larva on an artificial diet. In field populations this polymorphism seems to be largely obscured by the dominant green colour which seems to be derived from the colour of the foodplant. Initial attempts to select for the white, red and green colour of the larvae were unsuccessful. The frequency of the red larvae increased significantly at the expense of the white and other pale-coloured larvae when the larvae were reared under red or green ambient light, whereas yellow and blue ambient lights had no effect. I suggest that the phenotypic decision of red versus white in the larval body colour may be made epigenetically. althoUgh some genetic predisposition to any body cotour is not ruled out.

As the fruits complete development nutrient sources for the ants at these sites are probably reduced; the tents are gradually abandoned. During development however, the fruits are protected by the presence of 'O. smamgdina'. A coevolution of 'O. smarag-dina' with 'S. cumini', surprisingly the first indicated for the completely arboreal ant, is suggested by these data.

N2  - A female of the mantispid 'Austromantispa imbecilla' (Gerstaecker) was observed resting after emergence from a retreat web of the salticid spider 'Mopsus penicillatus' (Karsch) in Townsville. The web was constructed on 16 December 1983 and the host eggs laid on 21 December. The spider was seen to emerge briefly from the web on only one occasion between then and 13 January, by which time the eggs had hatched. First sighting of the mantispid, facing vertically upward on the centre surface of the web, was at 9.35 pm (E.S.T.) on 14 January; the temperature was 29.5 C and the humidity high. It flew from the web at 9.45 and the web and its contained egg sac were collected at 10.40. Three living spiderlings were discovered; at least five others had emerged earlier.

N2  - Forty-five individuals of the primitive mecopteran, Austromerope poultoni, have recently been collected during systematic sampling near Boddington and Worsley in south-west Western Australia. &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62; The data indicate that the species is probably univoltine with a peak of adult activity in winter and extending into spring. It shows no apparent preference for vegetation association and occurs throughout a wide rainfall range in south-west Western Australia. The sampling programme suggests that the adult spends most of its time on the ground.

N2  - 'Larvae of Euploea core corinna' were sampled from 'Nerium oleander' and 'Parsonsia straminea'; both are common food plants in the Brisbane region. A higher percentage of larvae collected from oleander were parasitied (61%) compared to 'P. straminea' (7%). Three species of parasites were reared out: two tachinids, 'Paradrino laevicula' Mesnil and 'Winthemia neowinthemioides' (Townsend), and a chalcid, 'Brachymeria lasus' (Walker). The latter was recorded from 'E. core corinna' for the first time.

N2  - Females of 'P. decipiens excavated turretless nests in hard clay at Fowlers Gap in arid, western New South Wales. Females alighted on water surfaces and imbibed water for use in softening the nest substrate. Nests were provisioned with pollen of 'Eucalyptus camaldulensis'. Males were attracted to nest entrances, water and honeydew.

N2  - The early stages of Candalides cyprotus cyprotus (Olliff) are described and figured. Observations of its behaviour are discussed. &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62; The unusual behaviour of the first instar larvae "ring-barking" the flowers of Conospermum spp. is described. A suggestion is made that the larvae may be obtaining some substance from the flower pedicels. In this process the flowers are destroyed and more lateral leaves may be produced on the plants which could provide more food for the next generation of larvae. &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62; C. cyprotus cyprotus appears to be strongly associated with Conospermum spp. in the coastal heaths and sandy woodlands in the Sydney, Gosford and Hunter regions. This association with Conospermum spp. rather than Jacksonia scoparia may indicate that they are not conspecific with other populations e.g. Candalides cyprotus pallescens (Tite) and even any other populations feeding on Grevillea spp.

In addition a second form of 'Catopsilia pomona' (F.) is recorded for the first time. Only two species 'Eurema amplexa' (Butler) stat rev. and 'Polyura andrewsi' (Butler) are endemic. The male genitalia of 'Eurema amplexa' shows that it should not be considered a subspecies of 'E. hecabe' (L.) but deserves specific status.

N2  - The behaviour and movement of mass-released, non-reproductive 'Danaus plexippus' (l.) in the Blue Mountains, New South Wales was studied during autumn and winter 1984. An easterly migration into the Sydney basin occurred during warm weather in March and April. Movement of up to 75 km was recorded and three individuals were recovered from an overwintering colony of 'D. plexippus' at Wallacia. The advent of cooler weather during May-July inhibited long distance movement, resulting in the formation of a local population which displayed behaviour characteristic of overwintering, non-reproductive 'D. plexippus'.

N2  - Data are presented on the induction of pupal diapause in the papilionid butterflies, 'Papilio aegeus aegeus' Donovan and 'Graphium sarpedon choredon' (C. and R. Felder). Laboratory studies showed diapause in both species to be facultative and induced primarily by short larval photoperiods. Temperature had a modifying influence on the incidence of diapause, particularly in 'P. a. aegeus' which showed continuous development at warm temperatures. The diapause response of 'G. s. choredon' showed greater coupling to photoperiod at warm temperatures, but the non-diapausing effect of long photophases was negated by cool temperatures. Short photophases at 25 degreesC resulted in hastened larval development and reduced pupal weights in both species.

N2  - Field and laboratory data are presented on aestivation and reproductive dormancy of adult 'Heteronympha merope merope' (Fabncius) in New South Wales. Females emerge in October-November then aestivate, and ovarian development does not occur until early January. Ovarian maturation occurs primarily in response to cool temperatures and is enhanced by short photoperiods. Field populations become gravid from mid-February to mid-April depending upon local temperatures. Reproductive maturation is accompanied by an abrupt change in behaviour from sheltering and inactivity, to flight and dispersal.

N2  - The millipede 'Ommatoiulus moreleti' (Lucas) is a nuisance pest in southern Australia. especially during autumn and spring when large numbers invade houses. In a residential area of the Mt Lofty Ranges, South Australia, both male and female 'O. moreleti' (stadium 6 and older) were primarily nocturnal. There was no variation in activity rhythm with stadial age. In a woodland of 'Eucalyptus' spp. and on a house driveway, active male millipedes were scarce relative to females in late summer. In autumn, active males outnumbered females. This change may be related to sexual differences in climatic tolerance. In the oldest adult stadia, active males were rarer than females. This may be explained by poorer survivorship of males rather than sexual differences in activity. Local council records of applications for pesticide to combat millipedes suggested a close relationship between the eruption of activity and the onset of rains in lale summer and early autumn. However, no obvious association between applications for pesticide and prevailing weather was apparent in spring.

N2  - 'Emex australis' Steinheil is a polygonaceous plant of South African origin and a noxious weed in Australia, especially of irrigated vineyards in Victoria. Surveys were carried out in the Western Cape, South Africa to determine the fauna of 'E. australis'. Seventeen species of Lepidoptera, three species of Coleoptera and two species of Hemiptera were collected, most of which were polyphagous. Only one possibly new host specific insect was found 'Rhodometra sacraria' (L.) Two insects, 'Perapion antiquunt' (Gyllenhal) and 'Mierothrix inconspicuella' Ragonot, considered to be host specific, were collected and reared, the former for reintroduction into Australia as a biological control agent for 'E. australis' and the latter for further host specificity tests.

N2  - Three species of the large terrestrial hydrophilid genus 'Dactylosternum' Wollaston are reported from Australia and New Zealand, keys are provided to distinguish the species and separate the genus from allied sympatric genera, and distribution maps arc given for each species in the Australian region. 'D. abdominale' (Fabricius), a nearly cosmopolitan species that had not been confirmed from Australia previously, has probably been introduced into Australia and New Zealand in this century and is now widespread in synanthropic habitats. The Indo-Malayan species 'D. dytiscoides' (Fabricius) may be indigenous to northern Queensland. 'D. marginale' (Sharp), the only species restricted to the Australian region, was first described over a century ago from Auckland, New Zealand, but evidence presented here suggests that it is actually endemic to eastern Australia; it has probably been introduced into New Zealand and perhaps Norfolk Island in historical times.

N2  - The behaviour of single and paired last instar larvae of 'Austrolestes psyche' (Selys) was analysed from videotape records, and the repertoires of postures and movements compared with those recorded for other Zygoptera. Thirteen distinct postures or motions were found, four of which did not occur in isolated larvae. Several elaborate body movements may be agonistic displays. 'Labial strike' is presumed to be aggressive and was commonly followed by the retreat response of swimming.

'Cicada melanopygia, C. encaustica, C. varians, C. orgenlalu, C. curvicosta, C. moerens' and 'C. tristigma'. Two specimens from the Haworth collection (pre - 1833), of 'Tettigonia marginata' and 'T. harrisii' have also been identified, representing contemporary specimens with those described by Leach in 1814. The locations of the Leach types have been previously unknown and evidence suggests that these Hope specimens are the missing types.

De Baar (1977) recorded the subspecies from Bald Rock in New South Wales, just over the Queensland border and 15 km NE of Wallangarra, in March, 1976. The Queensland female mentioned by Common and Waterhouse was taken by the writer (Harslett 1965) on March 12, 1951, along a creek at Glen Aplin where blady grass, 'Imperata cylindrica' (L.) Beauv., was predominant and the dingy dart, 'Suniana lascivia lascivia' (Rosenstock), was flying freely. Though resident in the district I had not recorded the species for the ensuing 38 years since 1951 until February 1989 when two occurrences worthy of record were encountered.

N2  - Collections of march flies taken from human bait at Clairview, central Queensland on 18 days in November 1985 provided 95 females of 8 species. The catch was dominated by 'Cydistomyia avida' (Bigot) (44 specimens) and 'Scaptia subcana' (Walker) (26). Other species taken were: 'Cydistomyia magnetica' Ferguson and Hill, 'Dasybasis nemopunctata' (Ricardo), 'Pseudotabanus distinctus' Ricardo, 'Scaptia aureohirta' (Ricardo), a species near 'Pseudotabanus sitvester' (Bergroth), and an unidentified species of 'Dasybasis' Macquart.

Peak abundance was in January, before average weekly maximum temperatures exceeded 30 C. Peak reproductive activity, evidenced by pairs in copula, was also recorded in January. Longevity could not be precisely estimated; however some individuals lived at least 33 weeks. The preferred host species was 'Eucalyptus angulosa' Schauer, one of 5 species of native plant on which beetles were recorded.

N2  - Diapause termination and mortality were examined in oversummering eggs of 'H. destructor' collected from two pasture sites near Leeton, New South Wales, which differed in soil type and drainage. The effect of soil type and moisture on these factors was also investigated experimentally. Diapause termination was less reliable and mortality higher in eggs obtained from poorly drained clay than from well drained sandy loam. Soil type and moisture did not affect timing or extent of diapause termination. However, moisture increased mortality. Mortality of eggs on permanently wet sand was significantly greater than in any other treatment. The results from this study indicate that summer rainfall can have a deleterious effect on survival of oversummering eggs of 'H. destructor', particularly on heavy poorly drained soils.

N2  - Three Earthwatch expeditions excavated two nests, plotted colony distribution and observed foraging of the honeypot ant, 'Camponotus inflatus', in Northern Territory, Australia in July-August, 1987. Nests were associated with mulga trees ('Acacia aneura' F. Muell. ex Benth.) and had either single or multiple entrances. Two colonies contained 1063 and 4019 ants. Workers with swollen abdomens, called repletes, comprised 49% (516) and 46% (1835), respectively, of the populations. Six wingless queens were in the smaller colony. Replete abdomens were clear to dark amber; the largest was 15 mm long and weighed 1.4 g. The larger colony had 66 replete chambers with up to 191 repletes per chamber, reached a depth of 1.7 m, and radiated as far as 2.4 m from the entrance. Honeypot ants foraged during the day at extrafloral nectaries on mulga phyllodes as far as 9 m from nests and on a blue-tongued lizard ('Tiliqua' sp.) carcass. A raid of one honeypot ant colony on a smaller colony lasted several days and involved interactions with four ant species. Honeypot ants are eaten by some Aboriginal people and are significant in their Dreamtime, culture, and livelihood.

Highest densities were found in still waters supporting a moderate or dense growth of' 'Paspalum' spp. which was shaded for part of the day. Density was independent of water depth (6-10 cm cf. 11-15 cm) in the presence of 'Paspaium' spp. but was higher in water 11-15 cm deep when 'Cenchrum ciliaris' L. was the dominant grass. In this depth of water 'C. ciliaris' had more leaves on the surface and was more branched under water.

N2  - Japanese beetle traps baited with anethole attracted 20-36 times more adults of 'Phyllotocus navicularis' than did unbailed traps. In one of two tests eugenol and a Trece floral lure (10:22:11 2-phenylethylpropionatc: eugenol: geraniol) attracted significantly more 'P. navicularis' than did the unbaited traps. Competition from flowering plants may explain the difference in attractiveness between the two tests. 'Eupoecila australasiae' was attracted to anethole and less so to geraniol and the Trece floral lure.

Sixteen new records are noted for 'A. dealbata' in Tasmania and fourteen for Australia. The Cerambycidae was the most diverse family of wood-borers in this study demonstrating their importance as secondary insects influencing mortality and decomposition of 'A. dealbata'. The families Bostrychidae and Curculionidae were also numerically important, though less diverse. Buprestidae and Lyctidae occurred in small numbers. Predators of the coleopteran families Cleridae and Trogositidae and parasitoids of the hymenopteran families Aulacidae. Braconidae and Orussidae were also reared from 'A. dealbata' timber. Some cerambycid species are distributed within trees according to a positive relationship between beetle size and stem diameter.

N2  - An undescribed 'Hibiscus' sp. (Malvaceae) on Cape York Peninsula, Queensland is recorded as a larval host for 'Pectinophora endema' (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) and 'Pyroderces fatcatetla' (Lepidoptera: Cosmopterigidae). This is an extension of the known range for 'P. endema'. Both species pupate in separate parts of the 'Hibiscus' fruit and destroy as much as 66% of the predispersed seed crop.

N2  - A large-scale north-westerly movement of 'Euploea core corinna' is recorded from northern Queensland. Butlerflies moved consistently in a WNW direction at Townsville from at least mid-May to mid-June 1990. Females were relatively 'fresh' in wing condition and reproductively dormant. Flight activity occurred predominantly during warm sunny periods and ceased on cloudy days. The number in flight reached a maximum in late-May when approximately 2000 individuals crossed a 50 m transect per hour.

N2  - Observations on the life cycle and general biology of the large pierid butterfly, 'Delias harpalyce', were made between 1985 and 1990 near Melbourne, Victoria. Three mistletoes 'Amyema miquelii', 'A. pendulum' and 'Muellerina eucalyptoides' were utilised in approximately equal frequency. Populations were bivoltine with early-spring and mid-summer generations. Adults occurred in each month but were scarce between May and August. Adults of winter cohorts emerged over 4-9 days and in a 1:1 sex ratio. Pupal polyphenism is described and the two colour forms are shown to be seasonal: orange pupae predominaie in summer and black pupae in winter. In summer generations larvae pupated solitarily or in small groups, pupal webs were substantially smaller and the pupal stage varied from 3-4 weeks, compared with 6-10 weeks in winter. It is hypothesized that the black pupal morph plays an important adaptive role in thermoregulation and development during harsh winter conditions of low temperatures.

N2  - A dormant nest of a honey ant, presumed to be 'Plagiolepis squamulosa', was discovered during the excavation of an active nest of the black honey ant, 'Camponotus inflatus' Lubbock, at Uluru National Park, Northern Territory, Australia. The 'P. squamulosa' nest consisted of three chambers at depths of 26-42 cm and housed 5 de-alatcd queens, 114 workers, 96 repletes and 31 semi-repletes. The small repletes had greatly distended gasters but were mobile. Aborigines do not eat the repletes.

N2  - Observations on the life history and biology of 'Ogyris otanes' were made in the Stirling Range, Western Australia in November 1990. Details of the life cycle arc presented and the early stages described and illustrated. Larvae associate with 'Camponotus' sp, ('claripes' group) ants, and feed at night on small specimens of the host plant, 'Choretrum glomeratum' R. Br. The common name "western dark azure" is proposed for Western Australian populations of 'O. otanes'.

Females contained large amounts of fat body and showed no ovarian development. The pre-oviposition period of females from Roma (43 d) and Chinchilla (21 d) in the laboratory (25degreeC, LD 15:9 h) was significantly longer than in females collected at Leeton in southern New South Wales (1 d). The significance of summer reproductive dormancy in 'B. bibax' is discussed.

The larvae of all subspecies feed on the one host plant, which at that time was identified merely as 'Tylophora' sp. A number of species of 'Tylophora' have been described from New Caledonia, and the taxonomy of the genus is in need of review for the region, hence the lack of identification was understandable.

N2  - Although 'Melaleuca' spp. trees and shrubs are diverse, common, and widely distributed throughout Australia, there are few published records of insects associated with them. Since late 1986, surveys have been conducted in northern Queensland, south-eastern Queensland, and northern New South Wales to detect insects with potential for controlling 'M. quinquenervia' in Florida, USA, where it has become a serious pest. Over 400 herbivorous insects have been found associated with this tree and its close allies in Australia. This paper presents our records, including brief descriptions of many larvae, for 22 species of Noctuoidea moths (1 Arctiidae, 9 Lymantriidae, 11 Noctuidae, and 1 Thaumetopoeidae) collected and reared on 'M. quinquenervia' and five closely related species. Literature references, where available, to other host plants of each moth species are provided. Supplementary records are also presented for three additional Noctuoidea species which were only collected from these trees as adults or pupae.

N2  - As their common name implies, northern hemisphere members of the Trichoceridae are most commonly seen during winter when they appear in swarms on sunny days (Imms 1973). This characteristic has also been noted for southern hemisphere species. Alexander (1926) records them for late autumn, early spring and mild sunny days in winter while Colless and McAlpine (1991) describe their distribution as the cooler areas of southeastern Australia in the colder months of the year.

N2  - The well known Australian moth butterfly, 'Liphyra brassolis major', has an obligatory relationship with the green tree ant (weaver ant), 'Oecophylla smaragdina' (Fabricius), its larvae living inside the foliage nests of the ant and feeding exclusively on the ant's larvae. Because of this, the butterfly's distribution is limited by the distribution of 'O. smaragdina' which has been mapped in Australia by Lokkers (1986) to occur along the tropical coast from Broome (W.A.) in the west to Yeppoon (Qld) in the south. Hacobian (1992) has just recorded 'O. smaragdina' 100 km further south of Yeppoon at Tannum Sands.

N2  - Although 'Melaleuca' spp. trees and shrubs are diverse, common, and widely distributed throughout Australia, there are few literature records of insects from them. Since late 1986, surveys have been conducted in northern Queensland, south-eastern Queensland, and northern New South Wales to detect insects with potential for controlling 'M. quinquenervia' in Florida, USA, where it has become a serious pest. Over 400 species of herbivorous insects have been found associated with this tree, and its close allies, in eastern Australia. This paper presents our records, including brief descriptions of several larvae, for 17 species of Geometridae moths collected and reared on 'M. quinquenervia' and three closely related species. Literature references, where available, to other host plants of each of these moth species are provided. Four of these Geometridae species may be considered for further research as biocontrol agents for 'M. quinquenervia'.

N2  - A study of giant grasshopper, 'Valanga irregularis', infesting an orange ('Citrus sinensis' (L.) Osbeck) orchard at Coonamble [30 degrees58'S 148 degrees22'E] in central western New South Wales showed the population was univoltine: eggs laid in early spring hatched in late spring and early summer and nymphs fledged in early autumn; adult females remained in reproductive dormancy from autumn to mid winter and became sexually mature in late winter. No parasitoids were reared from field collected nymphs or adults, but the egg parasitoid 'Scelio flavicornis' Dodd (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) was reared from 16.6 per cent of field collected egg pods. Laboratory reared nymphs developed through 7 instars. At 27 degreesC the mean nymphal development time was 112.5 d +/- SE 3.2.   Phenology and feeding behaviour indicate that control of nymphs in late summer (February) is appropriate.

N2  - Regular trapping of dung beetles was carried out over 14 months at an elevated rainforest site in northern Queensland. The fauna comprised 12 species and extended the known southern distribution limit for most of the species. The dung beetle fauna was highly seasonal: maximum values of both richness and abundance occurred in the wet season and minimum values in the dry season.

N2  - Two aggregations of adult 'Biprorulus bibax' each comprising approximately 50 individuals, were observed on 'Eremocitrus glauca' at Chinchilla, Queensland in May 1992. Laboratory analyses revealed the aggregations to be comprised of non-reproductive bugs with large lipid reserves. The occurrence of non-reproductive 'B. bibax' on 'E. glauca' in late autumn suggests this plant is a winter as well as a summer host.

N2  - Recent research, relying on the rain of arthropods that falls after the application of a chemical fog or spray, has clearly demonstrated that insects are abundant and diverse in the canopies of Australian rainforests (Bassett 1991; Kitching 'et al'. 1993). Although estimates of insect species number may have been too enthusiastic (Monteith 1990), actual arthropod diversity and abundance are grossly underestimated by these chemical knockdown techniques because of their strong bias against small arthropods, especially mites (Walter 'et al'. 1994). Like the soil beneath the canopy, rainforest trees themselves are infused with a terrestrial plankton, composed primarily of minute, scurrying, eight-legged arthropods.

Total consumption averaged 153.9, 127.6 and 117.3 at 22.5 degrees, 25 degrees and 30 degreesC, respectively, although daily consumption was greater at 30 degreesC (2.5) than at 25 degreesC (2.0) or 22.5 degreesC (1.3). The large size, long lifespan and voracity of this general predator suggest it may be an important regulator of insect populations in some ecosystems.

N2  - The scelionid parasitoid 'Ceratobaeus setosus' Dodd was found in nests of the social spider 'Phryganoporus candidus' (L.Koch) (= 'Badumna candida' (L. Koch)) at Townsville, northern Queensland. It occurred from April to October inclusive, the months of the host's egg production. The wasps selectively parasitized some egg sacs, probably on the basis of the age of the eggs within. The primary sex ratio of 'C. setosus' was 88% female: 12% male. The mantispid egg predator 'Austromantispa imbecilla' (Gerstaecker) was sometimes present in sacs that contained 'C. setosus'.

Preliminary data on the age-dependent parasitization of one species on several hosts are presented, as well as rates of occurrence on adults of the specific vector, 'Chilocorus' Leach (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). A method of rearing the mite is described. This constitutes the first record of 'Hemisarcoptes' from Australia.

N2  - The relationship between distribution and reproductive behaviour was examined in Australian species of Macrochelidae. Species that reproduce by thelytokous parthenogenesis ('Macrocheles penicilliger, M. peniculatus, M. virgo') were usually found in temporally stable, physically continuous habitats such as leaf litter and compost. Sexually reproducing (arrhenotokous) species ('M. glaber, M. subbadius, M. merdarius, M. robustulus, Glyptholaspis americana') were found in a variety of habitats, but especially in ephemeral scattered habitats (dung pads in pasture). It has been argued that thelytokous species should have an advantage in colonising patchy disturbed habitats, but the females of arrhenotokous macrochelids are able to mate with their sons, and are commonly phoretic on insects. These factors make them effective colonisers of new or disturbed habitats.

N2  - 'Herimosa' gen. n. is proposed for the Australian endemic skipper 'Anisynta albovenata' Waterhouse. The immature stages and adults of this cryptic species are described and illustrated. Both adult and immature structures show that 'A. alhovenata' belongs with the 'Proeidosa' group of genera and not with 'Anisynta', a genus of small, moderately robust skippers. 'Herimosa' is defined, and illustrated comparisons of adult structures are made with those of 'Anisynta cynone' and 'Croitana croites'. It is also compared with the more distantly related 'Mesodina'. 'Herimosa' is more closely related to the proeidosine genus 'Croitana'. The randomly shared and generalised characters of the 'Proeidosa' group indicate that it is a diverse and archaic assemblage of the Trapezitinae. A key to the 'Proeidosa' group of genera is given, which is revised to accommodate the new genus.

N2  - Although 'Melaleuca' spp. are common and diverse in Australia, the herbivorous insects associated with these trees and shrubs are poorly known. Since late 1986, surveys have been conducted in Queensland and northern New South Wales to detect insects with potential for controlling the paperbark tree, 'Melaleuca quinquenervia', in Florida, USA, where it has become a serious pest. This paper, the third in a series, presents new host records for 31 species of Gelechioidea moths collected and reared on 'M. quinquenervia' and six closely related tree species. Some of the Xyloryctinae, as well as three other Gelechioidea may warrant further study of their potential as biocontrol agents for 'M. quinquenervia'.

The presence of many nests during the summer of 1991/1992 suggests that the wasps have been established in Canberra since well before 1990 when a nest was discovered for the first time. While the species is known to make huge nest aggregations in the south-eastern coastal area of New South Wales. it does not make such nest aggregations in Canberra. Details of nest architecture in the Canberra population are described.

N2  - A list of larval and potential larval food plants for six species of tropical Satyrinae is presented based on field observations in northern Queensland during 1989-93. Literature documenting larval foods for all Australian tropical Satyrinae is summarised. Larvae of two species, 'Mycalesis perseus' (Fabrieius) and 'Melanilis leda' (Linnaeus), are recorded on many grasses and are probably opportunistic. Oviposition behaviour is briefly described; direct egg-laying on the leaves of the food plant appears characterislic for this group of butterflies. Comments are made on adult feeding for nine taxa. Nectar feeding appears to be widespread, except 'Mycalesis' spp., and is particularly frequent in the smaller species 'Ypthima arctous' (Fabrieius) and 'Hypocysta adiante' (Hubner). 'Mycalesis terminus' (Fabrieius) regularly feeds on rotting fruits, but 'M. sirius' (Fabrieius) does not seem to utilise this resource. 'M. perseus' and 'M. leda' may also feed on rotting fruits.

Larvae feed at night on hemi-parasitic vines, 'Cassytha filiformis' L. in Queensland and 'C. glabella' R.Br, in coastal Western Australia, which grow over tussocks of 'Triodia' or 'Spinifex'. The distinctive pupal morphology provides support for the species current placement within the Candalidini. Egg and larval morphology and the food plants of 'Z. delospila' suggest a close relationship to the 'Candalides (Erina') group of 'Cassytha'-feeding species.

N2  - Frass widths are used to estimate the larval instars of 'Hypsipyla robusta' Moore, a shoot borer of Australian red cedar 'Toona australis' (F. Muell.) Harms. Based on the relationship betwen larval frass widths and larval head capsule widthe, the inter-instar boundaries of larval frass widths are calculated. The average frass widths of individual larvae are then compared with the boundaries to determine the larval instars. Ninety-three percent of laboratory larvae were assigned to their correct instars by frass widths and 87% of field larvae were estimated as in the same instars by frass widths as that determined by head capsule widths.

N2  - During surveys in Brisbane Forest Park (1991-1994), 'Austrophlebia costalis' was recorded from November to February. Most observations were from flowing streams in open or closed forest but two were next to a dry, rocky creek-bed in eucalypt open forest. Three dawn-to-dusk surveys in December, January and February indicated that 'A. costalis' was active from 0600 to 1800 h EST with no marked crepuscular peaks in activity but low activity from 0900-1200 h EST. The mean speed of the hawking flight was 6.2 km/hr and that of fast flight was 17.7 km/hr. The fastest timed speed was 34.1 km/hr.

N2  - The abundance of adull 'Scelio parvieornis' and 'S. improcerus' in a pasture site in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales exhibited stable spatial variation commensurate with site affinity. Both species were abundant on an uncultivated, lightly timbered granite knoll supporting native grasses and introduced broad leaved weeds but virtually absent in extensive improved pasture skirting the knoll. The cause of the site affinity is unknown but was possibly associated with biotic factors such as a seasonally stable host population and reduced competition from other parasitoids. The site affinity was also coincident with the habitat of 'Phaulacridium vittatum' in climax savanna woodland pre-europcan settlement and may represent an anachronistic, instinctual habitat preference. Although parasitism by scelionids was secondary to that of mermithid nematodes in influencing host population trends at all sites, the supplementary parasitism by scelionids could be important in habitats less favourable for mermithid nematodes. An inverse density dependence was apparent which could result in localised host extinction, extending the duration of the recessionary phase of the host outbreak cycle so limiting the frequency of grasshopper outbreaks.

(Asteraceae) at Sandy Bay, Hobart, were collected and reared in the laboratory to observe parasitism. Two species of primary parasitoid were recovered: 'Diolcogasler perniciosus' (Wilkinson) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and 'Chaetophthalmus similis' (Walker) (Diptera: Tachinidae). Mean parasitism by the two species was 25% and 12% respectively. A hyperparasitoid, 'Mesochorus' sp. (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), was found in association with 27% of 'D. perniciosus' broods. Life-history observations on 'N. amica' are included.

N2  - We conducted surveys in eastern Australia to detect potential agents for the biological control of 'Melaleuca quinquenervia' in Florida, USA. This paper presents records for 26 Lepidoptera species (including 11 Pyralidae) from nine families collected and reared on 'M. quinquenervia' and four of its allies. Two of these species warrant further study of their potential as biocontrol agents for 'M. quinquenervia'.

N2  - Nineteen species of dacine fruit flies are recorded as hosts of 'Dipterophagus daci' Drew and Allwood, a strepsipteran parasite which has been reared only from Tephntidae. Aspects of the ecology of 'D. daci' in northern Australia, in relation to the seasonal abundance of its two most abundant hosts, 'Bactrocera aquilonis' (May) and 'B. tenuifascia' (May), are reported. Monthly captures of the two hosts over a 12 month period indicated that their populations increased with the onset of higher temperatures, moisture levels and availability of host fruits. Numbers of 'D. daci' peaked about one month after 'B. aquilonis' and two months after 'B. tenuifascia' and evidence indicated that the seasonal activity of 'D. daci' was dependent upon the availability of its host and rainfall. Higher levels of parasitism occurred in 'B. aquilonis' than in 'B. tenuifascia' and rapid increase in host populations was probably one significant factor in the prevention of the parasite from causing a high level of parasitism during the period of high fruit fly population. The fruit flies and their parasites were more abundant in wet than dry habitats. 'D. daci' is recorded for the first time from the Solomon Islands. The family Dipterophagidae is reinstated.

N2  - A food plant for the larvae of 'Ocybadistes knightorum' is identified as the rare and locally restricted grass, 'Alexfloydia repens' Simon (Poaceae). Adult females of 'O. knightorum' were observed ovipositing on this grass at three localities previously recorded for this grass east of Bonville and near Boambee, New South Wales. The conservation significance of 'O. knightorum' and its food plant, 'A. repens', is discussed.

These are: egg, DZ = 0.55 degreesC, K = 112 DDs; 1st instar larva, DZ = 5.50 degreesC, K = 49 DDs; 2nd instar larva, DZ = 4.71 degreesC, K = 41 DDs; 3rd instar larva, DZ = 3.77 degreesC, K = 46 DDs; 4th instar larva, DZ = 3.78 degreesC, K = 64 DDs; pre-pupa and pupa combined, DZ = 5.41 degreesC, K = 184 DDs. Using a simple day-degree model, examples are given on how this information may be used in the field.

Two taxa represent valid senior names: 'Rioxa discalis' (Walker), comb. nov. [= 'Rioxa sumatrana' Enderlein, syn. nov.] from SE Asia and 'Acanthonevroides basalis' (Walker), comb. nov. [= 'Urophora bicolor' Macquart, syn. nov.] from South Australia; the others are new junior synonyms of 'Dacopsis signala' (Walker), 'Eupkranta connexa' (Fabricius) and 'Diarrhegma modestum' (Fabricius).

N2  - Evidence is presented which strongly suggests that butterflies of the pierine genus 'Delias' Huhner are highly distasteful or even toxic to vertebrate predators, but may be consumed without ill effects by invertebrate predators. The role of 'Delias' species as models for Batesian and Mullerian mimetic assemblages is discussed, with particular reference to the probable Batesian mimics of the genus 'Mynes' Boisduval. It is suggested that the inexact resemblance of Batesian mimics of Delias is due to their fluttering flight, which transmits a distinctive flash pattern but few fine details of colour and pattern. A similar argument provides an explanation for the lack of discernible Mullerian assemblages in the genus. The relatively few mimics of 'Delias' may also be a result of the probable Gondwanan origin of the genus and its present day preference for temperate or montane climates, which has meant there has been insufficient contact with potential mimics from the Oriental fauna for many associations to form.

N2  - Fortnightly observations were made on a larval population of 'Danaus plexippus' (L.) at Hazelbrook. New South Wales to provide information on winter survival in the Blue Mountains. The population was decimated in July and August apparently by strong, cold winds. Only small numbers of larvae and pupae survived until September and none produced adult butterflies.

N2  - Parasitism of late-instar 'Acacicola orphana' larvae was assessed at six locations throughout Tasmania in October 1997. Overall rates of parasitism were very low and only one parasitoid was collected, a species of 'Lixophaga' Townsend (Diptera: Tachinidae). Only 17 tachinid pupae were reared from 600 larvae (2.83% parasitism), but the number of larvae initially observed bearing tachinid eggs was higher (32 larvae, 5.3% parasitism). The emergence rate of adult tachinids was low, with only four of the 17 pupae (23%) yielding flies. The number of larvae bearing tachinid eggs between sites ranged from 0-17 and was positively and significantly correlated with tree damage estimates made at the collection sites during the previous season.

N2  - In New South Wales, newly hatched larvae of 'Heteronynyjha merope merope' (Fabricius) in autumn are bimodal with respect to feeding behaviour. Non-feeding larvae failed to survive or commence feeding when held in warm (28 degreesC) temperatures and long (15 h) photoperiod (P). Feeding larvae developed rapidly in these conditions to the final instar but were unable to pupate. Post-hatching exposure (1-3 months) of feeding larvae to autumn-winter conditions of cool temperatures and declining photoperiod, prior to transfer to 25 degreesC, 15 h P, enabled development through to adulthood. Larval development in 'H. merope' is discussed with respect to the apparent existence of diapause and host grass availability.

No bugs died when fed on mealworm 'Tenebrio molitor' (L.) larvae. It is concluded that cardiac glycosides sequestered by 'D. plexippus' larvae from its milkweed host plant, 'Asclepias fruticosa' (L.), were progressively accumulated within 'P. plagipennis', resulting in bug mortality.

N2  - Female 'Rhopalum bendorense' Leclercq excavated 1.5-2.5 mm diameter burrows in recently exposed pithy green stems of various shrubs during January to March 1999 in Canberra, ACT. Burrow length averaged 55 mm (range 19 to 105 mm). Prey comprised six families of flies and two families of adult Psocoptera; Diptera predominated 4:1. Females practiced modified mass provisioning; the egg was laid transversely on the prothorax of one of the first several prey, with additional prey provided (up to 41 total) by the time the larva began to feed, at which point the cell was closed with a partition of compact pith. In two of the 14 active nests more than one female was present, but their relative contributions were unknown. No parasitoids were reared and there appeared to be two overlapping generations. Reared sex ratio from the first generation was about 2:1 female biased.

N2  - 'Taylorimyia iota' (Johnston and Tiegs) is recorded parasitising adult and nymphal 'Biprorulus bibax' Breddin in the Chinchilla district of southern Queensland. Egg-like structures (ELS) (1-22 per bug) were found attached to dorsal and ventral surfaces of up to 36% of 'B. bibax' collected during spring-summer from 'Eremocitrus glauca' (Lindl.) Swing. One male bug dissected in September 1998 contained a large maggot. One adult 'T. iota' emerged in the laboratory from a female bug collected in November 1998. Five of 19 adult 'B. bibax' with attached ELS collected in November 1998 and dissected after death, contained small maggots. In November 1998, adult 'T. iota' were observed 'visiting' wild and caged 'B. bibax'. Adult 'B. bibax' confined in a glass tube with larvae that emerged from the abdomen of a damaged 'T. iota', carried ELS after three hours. Microscopic observations suggested 'T. iota' larvae secreted these structures, presumably for protection, during entry into 'B. bibax'. The biology and potential of 'T. iota' as a natural enemy of 'B. bibax' is discussed.

This paper records a second established population, restricted to the island of Aneityum (= Anatom), Vanuatu. The discovery of this second population provides the first opportunity for hybridization experiments which may shed light on the origin of the 'nivosus' gene.

N2  - A census of cicada exuviae, collected regularly over 5 months, is reported from a 5.0 ha site of coastal parkland with fringing mangroves, at Golden Beach, 3-4 km south of Caloundra, S.E. Queensland. Two emergence patterns occurred, both extending over about 4 months. One type characterized the higher density species 'Psaltoda plaga' (Walker), 'P. claripennis' Ashton, 'P. harrisii' (Leach) and 'Arunta perulata' (Guerin-Meneville), in which "explosive" emergence reached a peak in early-mid December, then slowly decreased over 75-80 days. Male/female ratios were initially high, but progressively decreased to become female dominated. The second pattern, shown by the low density species 'Cicadetta hackeri' (Distant) and 'Abricta curvicosta' (Germar), showed "diffuse" emergence with no systematic change of sex ratios. Exuvial densities for the six species were, respectively, 3,928, 3,582, 424, 292, 93 and 50 per ha, with a total density of 8,369 per ha (49 per tree), consistent with overseas data. Emergence of the six cicada species was synchronous, but their songs are species specific.

N2  - 'Anoploiepis gracilipes' (Smith) was first recorded from the Australian mainland in East Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, in May 1990. In a survey during November 1999, it was found over five river drainage systems covering an area of approximately 2,500 km squared but was mainly confined to thin strips of monsoon rainforest bordering perennial springs and streams. It was found only once in dry open 'Eucalyptus' woodland. Highest populations were found in a disturbed habitat, although the ant was absent from Nhulunbuy town and aboriginal communities. The large area infested with 'A. gracilipes' suggests that an eradication campaign would be extremely difficult.

N2  - Mating behaviour of greyback cane beetle, 'Dermolepidu albohirtum' (Waterhouse) and grata cane beetle, 'Lepidiota grata' Blackburn, is described and compared. Mating pairs of 'D. albohirtum' were observed within feeding aggregations in 'Ficus opposita' and 'Acacia' spp. during 4 hours from late afternoon to early evening. Copulation by 'D. albohirtum' lasted on average 12 minutes and was preceded by the male resting piggy-back on the female and vibrating her body. Mating by 'L grata' occurred during a 30 minute period in trees at dusk. Females of 'L. grata' called by repeatedly extending and retracting their ovipositor. Males appeared shortly after, flying upwind. Copulation followed immediately a male mounted a female, and lasted on average 18 minutes. Any sex pheromone produced by 'D. albohirtum' may be active over a distance of less than 1 m, and may not be useful for monitoring numbers. By comparison, the mating behaviour of 'L grata' is consistent with a sex pheromone that acts over longer distances.

N2  - A description of an encounter with stinging caterpillars on 23 May 1770 at Bustard Bay, Queensland in Joseph Banks' Endeavour journal refers to larvae of 'Doratifera stenora' Turner and is the first record of Limacodidae from Australia. Mature larvae of 'D. stenora' matching Banks' description were collected in April 1999 at Ningi, southeastern Queensland, feeding on leaves of Spotted mangrove, 'Rhizophora stylosa' Griffith (Rhizophoraceae). Notes on the life history, larval morphology and distribution of 'D. stenora' are provided. Larvae of 'D. stenora' differ markedly from those of other species of 'Doratifera' Duncan [and Westwood]. It is the only known species with gregarious mature larvae and the only species known to feed on Rhizophoraceae. Mature larvae have a full complement of 10 pairs of lateral and 10 pairs of subdorsal scoli, all apparently armed with stinging setae. They lack the pairs of subdorsal protuberances armed with eversible rosettes of stinging setae that are characteristic of other known 'Doratifera' larvae.

The nymphs form pit galls on expanding leaves, distorting and stunting plant growth. Rearing experiments showed that the psyllid was able to complete its life history on 7 species of trees belonging to 3 allied genera in the Myitaceae: 'Acmena', 'Syzygium' and 'Waterhousea'. Birds, spiders, coccinellids, ants and a tettigoniid were recorded as predators of 'T. eugeniae' eggs, nymphs and adults. The most important natural enemy was the eulophid parasitoid 'Tamarixia' sp.

N2  - The life cycle of the southeast Queensland glow-worm 'Arachnocampa flava' Harrison is documented and comparisons made with the more extensively studied New Zealand glow-worm, 'A. luminosa' (Skuse). The adult life span of 'A. flava' is short. Females live a maximum of 2.5 days and males 6 days. Egg development time is 7-9 days and the pupal stage lasts 6-7 days. Behaviour associated with snare construction, prey capture and snare mending is described. Pupae lie suspended horizontally by an anterior and posterior bracing cord, whereas 'A. luminosa' pupae are suspended vertically by a single cord attached at the thorax. Only larvae and one early stage female pupa of 'A. flava' were observed to bioluminesce in the laboratory.

The results of these observations suggest that the species is widespread in suitable habitat in southwestern Western Australia and that its conservation status may be more secure than previously considered. The relationship between this species and others, notably 'T. sciron' Waterhouse and Lyell, remains unclear.

N2  - Use of plant and dead animal material in the final stages of nest closure in 'Podalonia tydei suspiciosa' (Smith) is recorded for 16 out of 17 nests studied. One individual used sand only to close the nest. Females cradled caterpillar prey with the forelegs. Female nesting behaviour, nests and cell size and shape were variable. Nests were made either before or after prey was captured. Nest cells were constructed in dry loose sand. All other sand-nesting solitary wasps nesting in the area constructed nest-cells in firm, moist sand. 'Tachysphex nigerrimus' (Smith) (Larridae) competed with 'P. t. suspiciosa' for nests, even usurping those of the latter, which it would then extend into firm, slightly moist sand. A number of mistakes in previous publications on the biology of 'P. t. suspiciosa' are corrected.

The number of gall-forming adults and parasitoids reared from individual galls is compared with the size of the galls. The effect of galling on host plant health is commented on in relation to planting of these 'Acacia' species in community or government funded projects. Twenty-one insect species were reared from galls formed by 'Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae' on 'Acacia' species in Tasmania.

N2  - Host plant records from northern Queensland suggest that 'Bactrocera visenda' (Hardy) is monophagous on 'Garcinia warrenii' (native mangosteen: Clusiaccae). Populations of 'B. visenda' increased markedly from November to February annually, which correlates well with the fruiting period for 'G. warrenii'. Almost all 'G. warrenii' fruit collected produced 'B. visenda, which was not reliably reared from any other host. A record from 'G. gibbsiae' remains unconfirmed. 'B. visenda' was not reared from cultivated mangosteen ('G. mangostana') and is unlikely to become an economic pest of cultivated fruit in this region.

The methodology used to import the parasitoid and its subsequent release throughout the Torres Strait region is described. In all cases establishment of the parasitoid was recorded within 20 months of releases, commonly quite sooner. There appeared to be an inversely proportional relationship between the numbers of parasitoids released at a location and the time taken for the parasitoid to establish.

N2  - An assessment of 10 crop plants for susceptibility to 'Bemisia tabaci' (Gennadius) B-biotype (Silverleaf whitefly, SLW) was undertaken during the summer of 2001/2002 in central Queensland. Crops included in the assessment were chickpea, cowpea, lablab, mungbean, niger, peanut, sesame and soybean. Data on SLW abundance and preference ranking for each crop type are presented. Sesame was the most preferred for oviposition, mungbean was the least preferred while cowpea, peanut, niger, lablab and soybean were intermediate. Nymphs were more abundant on sesame, soybean and lablab than on mungbean, cowpea, niger and peanut. Chickpea was found to be unsuitable for SLW development. Crops such as sesame, soybean and lablab are likely to be high risk cropping options in parts of central Queensland where SLW is likely to become endemic.

N2  - 'Laccocenus vicinus' sp. n. is described from Deua Cave, Southern New South Wales and compared with L. ambiguus Sloane. Although L. vicinus shows no evident morphological adaptation to cave-dwelling, its type series was associated with bat guano and includes one teneral individual, thus indicating that the species should be classified as a troglophile.

N2  - A survey for pests of crops on Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands was conducted in May 2000. Fifteen new pest records were obtained from Christmas I., viz: 'Aleurocanthus woglumi' Ashby and 'Neomaskellia bergii' (Signoret) (Aleyrodidae), 'Pentalonia nigronervosa' Coquerel (Aphididae), 'Coccus' sp. and 'Saissetia' sp.

(Tephritidae) and 'Cosmopolites sordidus' (Germar) (Curculionidae). Six new records were obtained from the Cocos (Keeling) Is, viz: 'Aphis gossypii' Glover, and 'Rhopalosiphum maidis' (Fitch) (Aphididae), 'Ceroplastes rubens' Maskell (Coccidae), ?'lcerya' sp. (Margarodidae), 'Ferrisia virgata' (Cockerell) and 'Saccharicoccus sacchari' (Cockerell) (Pseudococcidae) and 'Cosmopolites sordidus' (Germar) (Curculionidae). 'Aleurocanthus woglumi, Amrasca devastans, Bactrocera albistrigata' and 'B. arecae' also represent new records for Australia although these species are known so far only from Christmas I. A list of insect pests so far recorded from these islands is also included.

N2  - 'Hypolycaena litoralis' sp. n. and its life history are described and illustrated from Torres Strait, Queensland. It belongs to the 'branded' 'Hypolycaena' C. and R. Felder group, with males possessing a sex brand (a patch of androconial scales) on the forewing upperside and their larvae attended by the ant 'Oecophyila smaragdina' (Fabricius). The 'branded' 'Hypolycaena' species that occur in the region are reviewed and the external facies and genitalia of 'H. litoralis' are found to most closely resemble those of 'H. phorbas' (Fabricius). Adults and early stages are compared with 'H. phorbas' and the differences between the two species discussed. The behaviour of adult and larval 'H. litoralis' is documented and a description of the species' habitat included. Host plants are mangroves, 'Rhizophora stylosa' Griff, and 'Bruguiera' Sav. sp. (Rhizophoraceae). Currently, 'H. litoralis' is known from Boigu, Dauan, Saibai and Yam Islands, Torres Strait.

This paper presents collection records and biological information for five sawfly species: 'Acanthoperga cameronii' (Westwood), 'Perga vollenhovii' Westwood, 'Pergagrapta polita' Leach, 'Pterygophorus insignis' Kirby and 'Lophyrotoma zonalis' (Rohwcr); all in family Pergidae. One of these species, 'Lophyrotoma zonalis', was extensively studied as a biological control agent but concerns over its toxicity have delayed release.

N2  - Observations on directional flight and distribution records of 'Appias paulina' (Cramer) and 'Catopsilia pomona' (Fabricius) from southeastern Australia during late January and mid February 2004 are presented. The appearance of these otherwise tropical/subtropical species in the southern temperate latitudes coincided with observations of a large scale southerly migration recorded by several lepidopterists in southeastern Queensland and northeastern New South Wales, 600-1200 km further NNE, and were almost certainly part of the same mass movement. Climatic variables, particularly rainfall three months earlier following a severe dry period in central Queensland, coupled with above average rainfall in SE Queensland during January 2004, may have provided conditions which triggered the migration.

N2  - Various sampling strategies were assessed to estimate the population density of emerging nymphs/adult cicadas for three non-periodic species in the Sydney region: 'Cyclochila australasiae' (Donovan), 'Psaltoda moerens' (Germar) and 'Thopha saccata' (Fabricius). Densities for all three species under dry sclerophyll woodland to forest are likely to be 0.5-2/m squared. Density increases as the vegetation becomes more mesic to 2-5/m squared under rainforest for 'C. australasiae'. These densities are similar to other non-periodic species but low when compared with the periodical cicadas, especially 'Magicicada septendecim' (Linnaeus) and 'M. cassini' (Fisher), of eastern USA. Because of the possible loss of nymphs to predation and dispersion, the most reliable estimates of population density are counts based on emergence burrows. In contrast, counts based on careful searches of exuviae yielded as little as 40% of the burrow count.

N2  - Emergence patterns and temporal occurrence of 29 species of cicadas in three areas of western Sydney bushland are documented from surveys over eight consecutive seasons from September 1996 to May 2004. Sites were inhabited by 11-17 species, with nine undescribed species illustrated. Seasonal fluctuations in emergence patterns were generally dependent on the species and climate, with smaller, early emerging species persisting from October to December, larger species emerging in November and December and additional small species emerging during January and February. The annual numbers of the early emerging species suggest cyclical patterns of three to four years. 'Cicadetta celis' Moulds was the first species to appear each year, emerging in September, while 'Psaltoda plaga' (Walker) was the last, regularly persisting until May each season. Nearly half the cicada species inhabited 'Eucalyptus mollucana', especially the larger species, and most were associated with other Myrtaceae or 'Acacia' spp. (Mimosaceae). Smaller species in the genus 'Urabunana' Distant preferred shrubs and grasses.

N2  - A survey of the phytophagous insect fauna associated with the exotic weed 'Acacia nilotica' ssp. 'indica' (Benth.) Brenan was conducted throughout Queensland from 1979-89. Forty-two species, many of which are also associated with native 'Acacia' spp., were found on this plant. The more important species included the wattle cicada 'Cicadetta oldfieldi' (Distant), that may be implicated in 'dieback' of 'A. nilotica', the seed-feeding bruchids 'Caryedon serratus' (Olivier) and 'Bruchidius sahlberghi' Schilsky, the cerambyeid twig girdlers 'Platyomopsis' spp, and 'Anciti marginicollis' (Boisduval) and the termites 'Mastotermes darwiniensis' Froggatt and 'Coptotermes' sp. Two exotic species released during the study period, 'B. sahlberghi' in 1982 and the graciliariid 'Cuphodes profluens' (Meyrick) in 1983, have not impacted on the abundance of the host plant.

N2  - The return (autumnal) migration of 'Agrotis infusa' (Boisduval) from the Snowy Mountains commences after most plants have finished flowering, and the return journey to the plains to breed is generally against the general direction of the wind. At the commencement of these flights, bogong moths were recorded flying into the wind, which was a head wind at all altitudes up to 4000 m, and were observed feeding on honeydew.

N2  - A population of 'Heteronympha cordace wilsoni' Burns was discovered in South Australia east of Port MacDonnell in December 2004. Although it is unknown if the species is breeding at or near this site, due to the apparent lack of its host plant, this appears likely because of the extremely fresh condition of some of the specimens observed. 'H. cordace wilsoni' was presumed extinct from various localities where it was once common and this is the first documented observation for over 27 years.

N2  - Surveys for the distribution and relative abundance of the golden sun moth, 'Synemon plana' Walker, were carried out in remnant grasslands of Macgregor West in western Belconnen, ACT. These surveys revealed that 'S. plana' is concentrated mainly along the Ginninderra Creek corridor and its drainage lines, with the highest density of sun moths occurring in an open-grassland flood plain comprising improved pasture where the putative larval food plant, 'Nassella neesiana' (Trin. and Rupr.) Barkworth (Chilean needle grass) (Poaceae), grows as the dominant species. The flood plain habitat and the sun moth's association with this perennial exotic grass from South America are both unique in terms of current ecological knowledge of this threatened castniid. Supplementary observations made at Reid in central Canberra, ACT, strongly suggest that 'Bothriochloa macra' (Steud.) S.T. Blake (redleg grass) is also utilised. Further studies are needed to determine larval diet breadth and food plant preferences of 'S. plana', and to clarify the extent to which the species utilises introduced perennial grasses, in order to provide an effective conservation managementplan.

N2  - 'Hypolycaena phorbas' (Fabricius) from Queensland and the Northern Territory is reviewed. Females were found to form a cline in Queensland, with predominantly pale forms occurring in the south, progressing to mostly dark forms at the northern extremity of its range. This trend was found to be unrelated to season. Dark specimens from the northern Torres Strait islands were found not to differ from specimens from the Northern Territory and northern Western Australia, and further evidence is provided to place 'H. p. ingura' Tindale as a junior synonym (syn. n.) of. 'H. p. phorbas'. There is no evidence to indicate that variation in males is also clinal, with male variations found to occur randomly throughout the range of 'H. phorbas'. The current known distribution of the species in Torres Strait is summarised.

N2  - Mealybugs are serious pests of crops in Vietnam but there are several indigenous natural enemies that may be useful for their control. Life history data and the results of breeding trials are presented on two indigenous predator species, 'Scymnus bipunctatus' Kugelann and 'Chrysopa' sp. The suitability of both species for mass rearing and for release as augmentative biological control agents are assessed. Both predator species responded well under laboratory conditions and readily attacked the target species 'Dysmicoccus brevipes' (Cockerell). Their high levels of fecundity, short generation times and high survivability in captivity suggest they might be successful when reared in adequate quantities for release in augmentative biological control programmes.

In social history terms, the collection is a slice through the lite of a well-to-do Brisbane family, mostly from between the two World Wars, and includes a few items which, in their own right, are of international significance. Scientific objects are a small part of the collection but reflect the family's scientific interests, both as scientific practitioners themselves, and as a family with broader interests in popular science.

N2  - Nine species of Thripidac not yet, or only recently, listed from Australia are recorded from Queensland, with 'Pseudodetulrothrips alexei' described as new. Seven of these species are known from tropical areas to the north of Australia ['Anaphothrips swezeyi' Moulton; 'Bathrips melanicornis' (Shumsher); 'Caprithrips orientalis' Bhatti; 'Craspedothrips minor' (Bagnall); 'Danothrips trifasciatus' Sakimura; 'Mycterothrips nilgirinsis' (Ananthakrishnan); 'Scolothrips asura' Ramakrishna and Margabandhu]. The other two have been collected on plant species also found in Asia ['Mycterothrips desleyae' Masumoto and Okajima; 'Pseudodetiilrothrip alexei sp. n.]. These records further emphasise the difficulties of distinguishing between native and invasive thrips species in the northern Australian fauna.

N2  - The phylogenetic relationships and biogeography of troidine butterflies are reassessed. The subtribe Troidina is considered to comprise the following generic groups, representing vicariant separation within western, central and eastern Gondwana respectively: 'Parides' Hubner + 'Euryades' C. and R, Felder; the 'red-bodied swallowtails' 'Atrophaneura' Reakirt + ('Pachliopta' Reakirt + ('Losaria' Moore, stat. rev. + 'Cressida' Swainson)); and the 'birdwings' 'Trogonoptera' Rippon + ('Troides' Hubner + 'Ornithoptera' Boisduval). 'Pharmacophagus' Haase, with its sole species 'P. antenor' (Drury) from Madagascar, is retained as a subgenus of 'Pachliopta'. The suggestion that 'Pharmacophagus', 'Cressida' and 'Euryades' are relict taxa is rejected.

N2  - The final instar larva and pupa of 'Cephrenes moseleyi' (Butler) are described and illustrated from two specimens collected on Dauan Island, Torres Strait, Queensland and compared with the immature stages of 'C. triehopepla' with which it occurs. Overall, on Dauan Island, larvae of C. moseleyi were encountered much less frequently than those of 'C. trichopepla' (2:17). The host plant is 'Cocas nucifera' Linnaeus (coconut palm), with juvenile palms found to be preferred by larvae of both 'Cephrenes' species. The rearing of these two specimens from Dauan Island, together with another reared from Saibai Island in 2001, confirms the species' establishment in Australia.

N2  - The nocturnal male singing behaviour and songs of 'Froggatloides typicus' Distant are documented, based on observations and sound recordings made at the Southwood National Park in southern Queensland, during early December 2005, in an open net after dusk. Two distinct song components are recognized: (i) a continuous, soft clicking song (calling song) with some accompanying clicks and click phrases, emitted during the earlier part of the evening and believed to be predominantly timbal produced; (ii) sets of multiple ticks produced during the later part of the evening, commonly accompanying wing flicking behaviour and together with sporadically emitted, short, sharp buzz phrases which sound similar to the sudden expulsion of air from a restricted nozzle.

Additionally, some previous discontinuities in the distribution are filled in with records from the central coast of New South Wales, Mt Wilson west of Sydney and Mogo and Bodalla on the south coast. The list of known host plants of 'A. incompertus' is increased to 19 species by the inclusion of 'Eucalyptus agglomerata', 'E. andrewsii', 'E. cameronii', 'E. laevopinea' and 'E. resinifera', all economically important timer species. It is clear from the present study that the current distribution of 'A. incompertus' represents only a small subset of the range of the known hosts and it is therefore probable that the importance of this beetle as a potential pest has been understimated.

N2  - In parts of their ranges the mistletoe-feeding pierines 'Delias argenthona' (Fabricius) and 'D. nigrina' (Fabricius) overlap in time and space and compete for larval food plant. The range of food plants used does not correspond exactly for the two species, which also exhibit different phenologies in a given locality, 'D. nigrina' preferring the cooler months of the year. In coastal wallum forest in southern Queensland, larvae of both feed on the mistletoes 'Dendrophzthae vitellina' and 'Muellerina celastroides' but 'Diplatia furcata' is utilised only by 'D. argenthona' and 'Amyema congener' only by 'D. nigrina'. This study demonstrates that, in the presence of a competitor, both 'Delias' Hubner species switch their oviposition patterns, laying more of their egg clusters on the mistletoe species not used by the competing species. It is also demonstrated that, in experimental situations, ovipositing females of both species avoid plants carrying egg masses of their own and the competing species and lay preferentially on plants without eggs. It is suggested that in nature the decision to oviposit is made only after a thorough visual assessment of the mistletoe plant and plants bearing eggs are avoided.

N2  - The understorey tree 'Ryparosa kurrangii' B.L.Webber (Achariaceae) is restricted to a limited number of populations in three distinct valleys of lowland tropical rainforest in northern Queensland, Australia. To provide baseline information for determining potential pollen vectors and the opportunity for inter - population gene flow, flowering morphology, phenology and flower visitation were studied in natural populations over a number of seasons. Contrary to all previous work, 'R. kurrangii' was found to be monoecious, with temporally separated flushes of staminate and carpellate flowers. Flower production was primarily basicauliflorous on the main trunk with small open flowers borne on long racemes. Heavy nocturnal scented nectar production coincided with peak animal visitation. Predominant flower visitors were adults of an undescribed species of 'Monolepta Chevrolat sensu lato' (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Galerueinae) and nynmphs of 'Coridzolon australiense' Carvalho and Gross (Heteroptera: Miridac: Mirinae: Hyalopeplini). Now that the floral biology and morphology as well as the dominant flower visitors of 'R. kurrangii' base been documented, further work is required to determine the likely contribution of flower visitors to pollination events and population gene flow.

Based on these assessments, 'O. m. moira' is placed as a new synonym of 'O. m. licium', with the latter becoming the appropriate subspecific name for 'O. medus' (Fabricius) in Australia. In addition, specimens of 'O. m. licium' from Torres Strait, collected throughout the wet season, showed a higher frequency of extra ocelli on the underside of the wings of both sexes than specimens from Papua New Guinea, which were mostly collected during the dry. In contrast, the width and prominence of the underside white transverse lines in both populations did not correlate with season or gender. Two Torres Strait specimens collected in February 1994, during the wet season, are similar to a dry season form recorded from India.

New records of 'T. sessiliba'  Distant are given, confirming the presence of the species west of the Great Sandy Desert. The colour of these 'western' 'sessiliba' is different from specimens found east of the Great Sandy Desert and it is suggested that these 'western' 'sessiliba' might represent another new species. A population of melanie 'T. seassiliba' is recorded from Haliday Bay, near Mackay, Queensland and a melanic individual from near Chillagoe, Queensland, is also noted. A brief discussion on the size of 'Thopha' Amyot and Serville species concludes that 'T. saccata' (Fabricius) remains Australia's largest cicada.

N2  - A female specimen of 'Danaus chrysippus cratippus' (C. Felder) is recorded from Thursday Island, Torres Strait, Queensland. This constitutes the second known specimen of this taxon from Australia and the first record for Queensland. Due to the paucity of reference material of 'D. petilia' (Stoll) from Torres Strait, it is unclear whether this specimen of 'D. c. cratippus' is a vagrant or constitutes part of a natural sympatric distribution with 'D. petilia' in northern Australia. The known distribution of 'D. petilia' in Torres Strait, based primarily on observation records, is provided and encopmasses almost all inhabited islands. Based on these records its temporal distribution in Torres Strait appears irregular, perhaps reflecting its dispersive and nomadic movements among the islands.

N2  - 'Serobiger splendidus' (Newman) was observed ovipositing on, and emerging from, the nest of a native bee ('Hylaeus' sp.) at Indooroopilly, SE Queensland. Based on published accounts of a North American clerid exhibiting similar behaviour, it is likely that 'S. splendidus' is a predator of 'Hylaeus' spp. in Australia. This is the first evidence of apivorous habits for a native Australian clerid beetle.

N2  - The life history and general biology are described and illustrated for 'Euploea alcathoe enastri' Fenner, which is endemic to Gove Peninsula in northeastern Arnhem Land, Northern Territory. The larval food plants include 'Parsonsia alboflavescens, Gymnonthero oblongo' and 'Morsdenia glandolifera' (Apoeynaccae) growing in relatively small patches of mixed paperbark tall open forest with rainforest elements in the understorey, usually in juxtaposition to wet monsoon forest (evergreen vine-forest), or in the ecotone between wet evergreen vine-forest and savanna woodland or paperbark woodland (i.e. rainforest edge); both habitats are associated with perennial groundwater seepages or springs in lowland coastal areas that may be flooded seasonally. 'P. alboflavescens', which likewise is restricted to Gove Peninsula. appears to be the preferred food plant. Adults appear to breed throughout the year and the life cycle from egg to adult is completed in about four weeks during the dry season. The early stages are briefly compared with those of 'E. a. misenus' Miskin and 'E. core corinna' (W.S. Macleay).

N2  - The immature stages and some life history details are described for the two subspecies of 'Hypochrysops apollo' Miskin that occur in Australia. Eggs of 'H. a, apollo' and 'H. a. phoebus' (Waterhouse) were of similar size but those of 'H. a. apollo' were pitted but otherwise smooth whereas eggs of 'H. a. phoebus' had conspicuous ridges and spines. First and second instar larvae had the same basic patterns of setae but the setae of 'H. a. apollo' were much shorter and more thickened or flattened than those of 'H. a phoebus'. First instars also differed in the development of some of the glandular structures on the body. Larvae of both subspecies passed through at least eight instars before pupation under artificial rearing conditions. There were differences in oviposition site between subspecies, with eggs of 'H. a. apollo' being laid closer to the leaves of the food plant, and in first-instar duration, with larvae of 'H. a. phoebus' moulting sooner to the second instar, but these life history differences were confounded with differences in food plants and rearing occasions.

In 1990 it was first recorded in Australia in Torres Strait and in 2001 it was detected on the Australian mainland in the Northern Peninsula Area (NPA) at the tip of Cape York Peninsula, Queensland. Results from annual surveillance conducted from 2001-2007 in the NPA indicated that 'D. sublimbalis' was spreading through natural adult dispersal at an average rate of 7 km/year. This provides the first record of this pest's rate of spread, the understanding of which is necessary in formulating control strategies.

N2  - Although Ross Storey was widely known as the custodian of the Department of Primary Industries (QDPI) Mareeba Insect Collection and for his Coleoptera taxonomy, it is less well known that he played additional significant roles within the entomology group at Mareeba and the wider community on the Atherton Tableland. This area of far north Queensland, just to the west of Cairns, is unique for its varied rainfall, soil types and elevation across a distance of less than 100 Ian from north to south. The Mareeba-Dimbulah Irrigation Area, fed from Tinaroo Dam, originally supported the largest tobacco growing area in Australia. This area has subsequently moved over to crops like avocados, bananas, longans, lychees and papaya and is now particularly known for its mangoes. The higher areas around the town of Atherton, with their rich red basalt-derived soils, have long been known for dairying and maize, peanut and potato production. More than 60 different crops are now grown across the Atherton Tableland. Since the early 1980s, when the new QDPI facilities were completed at Peters Street in Mareeba, this centre has been the hub of agricultural research in the district. Several other groups have shared this centre over the past 25 years, including the Queensland Departments of Environment and Natural Resources (which have both undergone numerous name changes), the Northern Australian Quarantine Strategy of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and, briefly, CSIRO. Ross had a particular affection for the Tablelands and Mareeba, which his colleagues will recall he frequently reminded everyone was 'The centre of the Universe'

N2  - A large collection of trogid beetles obtained from wet pit-traps in the Little Sandy Desert of Western Australia provided an opportunity to examine gut contents of a series of adult specimens of four species of 'Omorgus' Erichson. The diet of the flightless species 'Omorgus rotundulus' (Haaf) (by far the most numerous species trapped) proved to consist mainly of invertebrates, especially ants and termites. Guts of three alate species of 'Omorgus', by contrast, were largely devoid of solid material. Whether 'O. rotundulus' is a predator of live invertebrates or scavenges dead specimens could not be established though the former is deemed to be more likely.

N2  - Now Australian distribution records for the tramp dacctinc ant, 'Pyramica membranifera' (Emery) arc provided. Previously recorded only from the Top End of the Northern Territory, the species is now known to be widely distributed in subtropical and tropical Queensland, with records from suburban Brisbane and the Blackall Range in SB Queensland, the Proserpine region in central Queensland, Cairns in northern Queensland and Heron Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef. The Queensland records arc predominantly from relatively disturbed environments, including suburban and agricultural landscapes, suggesting that 'P. membranifera' is introduced. Its wide distribution suggests that it has been present in Australia for a considerable length of time, but its cryptic nature and propensity to occur in disturbed habitats probably contributed to the delay in its detection.

N2  - New data are provided on the ecology, phenology and morphology of the zygaenid moth 'Pollanisus eumetopus' Turner, 1926. The known distribution of the species is significantly increased. The chactotaxy of the first instar larva is described and the setal arrangement appears to be characteristic for the Artonini. The larvae possess three anal combs similar to other species of the genus 'Pollanisus' and of the tribe Artonini. The presence of a small ball of silk spun on the outside of the cocoon is a character apparently typical of the genus 'Pollanisus' but has not been described for other Procridinae. The colour of ocelli, formerly considered an important character for distinuishing species of 'Pollanisus', is variable in dried specimens of 'P. eumetopus' and therefore not suitable for species identification.

N2  - Species of the amathusiine genus 'Taenaris' H bner known to occur in Australia, predominantly from Torres Strait, are reviewed and illustrated. 'T. myops kirschi' Staudinger is recorded for the first time in Australia from four male specimens collected on Dauan Island, Torres Strait. A female specimen of the satyrine 'Elymnias agondas melanippe' Grose-Smith also collected from Dauan Island represents the first record of this taxon from Australia. The high degree of variation observed in the external facies of 'Taenaris' from Torres Strait and reliable taxonomic separation of female specimens are discussed. 'Taenaris'-like forms of the papilionid, 'Papilio aegeus ormenus' Guerin-Meneville and 'E. a. melanippe' from Torres Strait and Dauan Island respectively are illustrated and reviewed. The form of 'P. a. ormenu's from Torres Strait that is most similar to 'Taenaris' spp is identified as form 'ormenus' Guerin-Meneville variety 'onesimus' Hewitson.

N2  - Bogong moths constitute a keystone species in the ecology of the alpine zone of mainland Australia with an estimated 2.2 billion moths migrating to the Snowy Mountains annually. During spring they are found in temporary camps and in aestivation sites in boulderfields and among complex rock tors, with most moths moving to the higher altitude sites as summer progresses. Aestivation sites have a higher relative humidity than in nearby meteorological screens but similar temperatures. Crevices in boulderfields and among rock tors are open to heat exchange with the atmosphere during the summer and consequently their temperatures fluctuated in step with the fluctuations in the screens, but with the dampening of extremes in the aestivation sites. This meant that the average daily temperature in aestivation sites falls with increasing altitude at about 0.7 degreeC per hundred metres of ascent, which approximates the regional lapse rate. As a consequence, questions about the future viability of aestivation sites for bogong moth populations (and that of their obligate parasites and predators) under a future climate change scenario can be answered from general climate models.

N2  - A review of records of gynandromorph specimens in the genus 'Ornithoptera' Boisduval is presented, with the causes of gynandromorphism in insects briefly discussed. Most Ornithoptera gynandromorphs are known from 'O. priamus' (Linnaeus), which probably reflects the number of specimens available as opposed to an unusual tendency towards gynandromorphism in this species. Gynandromorphs are also known of 'O. croesus lydius' (Felder), 'O. victoriae regis' (Rothschild), 'O. goliath' Oberth r, and the Australian taxa 'O. priamus pronomus' (Gray), 'O. richmondia' (Gray) and 'O. euphorion' (Gray).

N2  - Figure 1 shows a vespid wasp, 'Ropalidia romandi' (Le Guillou, 1841) bearing three extruded, parasitic stylopids (Strepsiptera: Stylopidae). It is not absolutely clear from the photograph if these are all adult females or include male pupae, although given the host's behaviour it seems most likely that at least one female is present. The photograph was taken on 8 February 2010 in Southport, Queensland. The wasp was behaving strangely, crawling to the top of a blade of grass, falling off and the climbing another one. It is possible the female parasites manipulate the host's behaviour so that it climbs to a good position to encounter males.

N2  - The early stages of 'Euploea tulliolus tulliolus' (Fabricius, 1793) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Danainae) are fully described and illustrated for the first time from material collected at Taigum, a northern suburb of Brisbane, Queensland. Development time from eggs collected in the field to adults in March in Brisbane was around 17 days. These adult progeny remained active over winter but females did not commence ovipositing until September of that year. An interesting feature of the life history is the distinctive smoky grey-white colour phase of the ultimate larva prior to pre-pupation. Within Brisbane the species occurs sporadically and is generally confined to remnant riparian forest along major creeks that crisscross the suburbs. In these habitats the species can be locally 'common'. The smoky grey-white colour phase recorded here for the ultimate larva of 'E. t. tulliolus' could be a diagnostic feature of all 'Euploea' Fabricius, 1807 species within the 'tulliolus'-complex and might also be a diagnostic feature of other 'Euploea' species groups.

N2  - We erect a new genus ('Samaecicada' gen. nov.) for 'Pauropsalta subolivacea' and provide the first description of the female. The acutely extended, straight to slightly inward facing upper lobes of the pygofer, in combination with undeveloped basal pygofer lobes and lack of pseudoparameres, distinguishes this new monotypic genus from all others in the tribe Cicadettini. Observations indicate that its seasonal emergence is erratic and adults are short-lived. Recent specimens have been captured on medium sized shrubs, notably 'Hakea' sp., in open woodland containing 'Angophora costata' trees on sandstone ridges.

A female black morph of this subspecies, otherwise endemic to Sumbawa, Indonesia, is recorded from near Darwin, Northern Territory. The specimen was recorded during the height of the summer monsoon and probably represents a vagrant that dispersed to North-Western Australia facilitated by monsoonal climatic conditions (westerly trade winds) rather than by directional migration.

'P. suavis' is a very common insect in New Zealand and a significant pest of 'Pinus radiata' plantations. In view of the fact that the two specimens mentioned by Lower are the only ones known from Australia it is conjectured that they are mislabelled specimens from New Zealand and it is recommended that the name should be omitted from the Australian list.

N2  - Freshwater environmental assessment and monitoring studies rely heavily on aquatic insect larvae because larvae are seen to directly reflect the aquatic environment they inhabit. However, the species-level taxonomy of most aquatic insects is based on the diagnostic characters found in adults. The uncertainty of correlating adult-based species with aquatic larvae means that aquatic life stages are rarely identified further than generic level, especially where there are sympatric congeners. However, Plecoptera adults are poor dispersers and generally remain near their site of emergence. Therefore, stonefly adults have the potential to provide more finely resolved specieslevel information about their nearby aquatic larval sites. Both adult and larval Plecoptera were collected during sampling for macroinvertebrates in a monitoring project in the Snowy Mountains, New South Wales. The results show that the collection and identification of adult stoneflies has potential for finer scale delimitation of riverine ecosystems than information provided by larvae alone. Also, adult stoneflies collected can provide information in related studies of taxonomy, ecology, biogeography, biodiversity, conservation and climate change. An updated check-list and an outline of taxonomic studies of Australian stoneflies, including all primary literature, are also presented.

'Pollanisus marriotti' sp. n. is currently known from a single locality in the vicinity of Gembrook, east of Melbourne, where it occurs together with 'Pollanisus lithopastus' Turner, 1926, from which it can be readily distinguished by the coloration of the abdomen and the size of the head and compound eyes.

N2  - The purpose of this paper is to clarify and resolve the nomenclature of 'Ogyris halmaturia' (Tepper, 1890), a nationally threatened butterfly which has had a long and complex nomenclatural history. This complexity has arisen because: (1) the species group name 'halmaturia' was based on a mixed series comprising two different species; (2) historically at least six authors have attempted to resolve the nomenclature of 'halmaturia', but most failed to render a valid and unambiguous lectotype designation; (3) one of these authors (N.B. Tindale) made a particularly confusing lectotype designation in 1923; and (4) introduction of the name 'Ogyris waterhouseri' (Bethune-Baker, 1905). The proposal to treat O. waterhouseri as a junior synonym of 'O. halmaturia' is accepted. We argue that Tindale made the first valid and unambiguous lectotypification in 1923. Consequently, we propose, with the intention of bringing closure to this matter, that 'O. halmaturia' is the senior synonym of 'O. waterhouseri' and that Tepper's syntype 'female' is the lectotype male of 'O. halmaturia'. Attention is drawn to ambiguity in Article 74.5 (lectotype designation made before 2000) in the most recent edition of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.

N2  - A guide-arm pitfall trap design, suitable for biodiversity studies in remote or difficult terrain forest sites, was tested against a standard pitfall trap to determine effective capture of beetles, ants and spiders of different size classes. Paired sets of traps were established at unshaded and shaded sites within a 'Pinus radiata' plantation and a 'Eucalyptus nitens' plantation in Tasmania and run for 6 months. Overall results show that the guide-arm trap design had a significant effect on the capture abundance of beetles and large beetles, although a significant interaction existed between trap type and site. Capture abundance of carabid beetles, ants and large ants was not significantly affected by the guide-arm trap. Spider capture abundance was significantly higher in the standard traps than in the guide-arm traps.

N2  - 'Jamides aleuas pholes' Fruhstorfer, 1915 is recorded from northern Cape York Peninsula, Australia for the first time. A previously overlooked record from Kiunga in Western Province, Papua New Guinea is also noted. Notes on its life history and biology are presented and compared with the Australian endemic subspecies 'J. a. coelestis' (Miskin, 1891), previously recorded from Shipton's Flat near Cooktown south to Paluma in the Wet Tropics area of northern Queensland but with a new northerly record approximately 60 km north of Shipton's Flat. 'Jamides aleuas pholes' and 'J. a. coelestis' are allopatric in Australia, with populations geographically separated by some 550 km. The immature stages of 'J. a. pholes', like those of 'J. a. coelestis', have been discovered on 'Arytera' sp. (Sapindaceae) growing within the rainforest understorey. Larvae of 'J. a. pholes' were found to be associated with the ants 'Rhytidoponera' Mayr sp. (Ectatomminae) and 'Tetramorium pacificum' Mayr (Myrmicinae).

N2  - New butterfly, hawk moth and dragonfly records for the vegetated coral cays of the Capricornia Cays, including the first data from Lady Elliot and North Reef Islands, are presented and previously published records summarised. In total, 46 butterfly, 10 dragonfly and 4 hawk moth species are known from the islands, with 10 butterfly and three hawk moth species newly recorded: 'Jamides phaseli' (Mathew), 'Prosotas dubiosa' (Semper) and 'Psychonotis caelius' (C. and R. Felder) (Lycaenidae); 'Danaus affinis' (Fabricius) and 'Junonia orithya' Linnaeus (Nymphalidae); 'Graphium eurypylus' (Linnaeus), 'Papilio aegeus' Donovan and 'Papilio demoleus' Linnaeus (Papilionidae); 'Delias nigrina' (Fabricius) and 'Eurema alitha' (C. and R. Felder) (Pieridae); 'Hippotion celerio' (Linnaeus), 'Theretra margarita' (Kirby) and 'Macroglossum prometheus' (Boisduval) (Sphingidae). New dragonfly records comprise two species of 'Ischnura' Charpentier (Coenagrionidae), three species of 'Orthetrum' Newman, two species of 'Diplacodes' Kirby and 'Tramea loewii' Kaup (all Libellulidae). The four largest and most floristically diverse islands of the Capricornia Cays, North West, Lady Elliot, Heron and Masthead Islands, have the most diverse butterfly faunas with 27, 23, 20 and 15 species respectively. All 10 dragonfly species recorded from the Capricornia Cays are known from Lady Elliot Island (including 8 species known only from the island), which has a substantial ephemeral water body. In addition, four butterfly species are recorded from Bushy Island in Redbill Reef off the coast of Mackay, the first published data from this coral cay.

N2  - For the last 15 years, publications on Australian butterflies have most often used species-group names with their original spelling, regardless of generic placement, sometimes violating the requirements of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Recently, two new checklists of Australian butterflies have been published in which gender agreement requirements are observed. In these, there are 17 cases of disagreement between the lists and/or between the designations of earlier workers. This paper seeks to resolve these differences.

(M.) inopinata' being described by Fairchild and Mackerras (1977). The subgenus has a distribution along coastal eastern Australia from Cairns/Kuranda in northern Queensland south to Jarvis Bay in southern New South Wales (Mackerras 1960: fig. 21). One species is known from southwestern Western Australia. The new species runs to couplet 2 in Mackerras' 1960 key but differs in having a non-metallic scutum and abdominal sternites. The new species significantly increases the known distribution of the subgenus approximately 600 km northwards.

Eggs (L:W:H : 0.716 mm: 0.445 mm: 0.292 mm) were laid predominantly on the calyx of the fruit but not on flowers. 'Trichogramma' Westwood and 'Trichogrammatoidea' Girault wasps emerged from parasitised eggs. Pheromone traps caught moths throughout the year, with higher catches in spring and summer than in winter and in the presence of eggplant crops.

Comparisons are made between this species and the closely allied 'Burbunga queenslandica' Moulds, 1994. The song of 'B. mouldsi' is shown to be a sustained buzz that is nearly identical in structure to 'B. queenslandica' and differs only in its higher dominant frequency.

Both species are endemic to northeastern Queensland and share a unique feature in the genitalia, notably a pair of slender, elongate preanal processes situated basolaterally to segment X. On this basis they are assigned to a new species group within the genus 'Hydrobiosella' Tillyard, the 'H. eminentia' group. A key is provided for identification of all Australian 'Hydrobiosella' species groups.

The oviposition behaviour of the female of 'Cameronella' is similar to that of other pteromalids that have an expended ovipositor. Three major behaviours associated with oviposition were observed: antennation (including at the orifice of the host's gall), drilling and preening.

N2  - LED lights were trialled as a replacement for traditional fluorescent bulbs for catching emerging aquatic macroinvertebrates. Initial trials with white LEDs were disappointing, with the catch amounting to chance contact with the trap, but when ultraviolet LEDs were used, there was no significant difference from the traditional fluorescent trap of the same design. While the fluorescent trap used most or all of the available battery power, the LED lights used less than 10% of the available power. It is suggested that LEDs can be used to replace the more power-demanding traditional lights for use in light traps.

Since then, repeated surveys have been conducted as part of environmental impact assessments associated with the Gorgon Project development on Barrow Island. This baseline information on invertebrates is to be utilised as a component of surveillance programs in support of the Gorgon Project's quarantine detection system. These additional surveys on the island have yielded a further 20 species of psocopterans, bringing the total fauna collected to 25 species. This includes the first Australian record of the synanthropic species 'Dorypteryx domestica' (Smithers).

N2  - Courtenay Smithers' contributions to the knowledge of Psocoptera and other orders, notably Neuroptera and Mecoptera, are summarised. They extended over some 50 years and established him as a leading authority on these orders. His contributions to systematics, biogeography and biology of Psocoptera, particularly within the Australian region, were accompanied by compilations of global catalogues and bibliographies of immense value to others. His many publications assure him of a persistent place in the history of psocopteran studies.

N2  - The entomologist, Courtenay Neville Smithers (1925-2011), was born in South Africa and schooled both there and in England, developing an early interest in natural history. After serving in World War II, he returned to South Africa and trained at universities in Pretoria and Grahamstown, culminating in an MSc thesis on citrus entomology. While working in various applied posts in Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) and South Africa on tsetse fly, acacia entomology and general agricultural pests, he developed an interest in taxonomy of Psocoptera and moved to the Australian Museum in Sydney, as insect curator, in 1960.

N2  - The status of the exotic clerid beetle 'Opetiopalpus scutellaris' Panzer has been unclear due to the ambiguous nature of the single previous Australian record. Recent pheromone trapping at grain stores in Western Australia indicate that 'O. scutellaris' is locally naturalised within the Western Australian wheatbelt. It is considered likely that the trapped 'O. scutellaris' specimens originated from surrounding areas rather than being directly associated with grain.

N2  - This paper brings together a number of observations and photographs of 'aerial' (i.e. freestanding and exposed) resin brood cells constructed by Australian 'Megachile' Latreille species. The cells were attached either singly or in groups to dead twigs on shrubs, standing grass flower stalks and the underside of a rock. In southwestern Australia, at least two species are known to build cells attached to dead woody twigs. Three females of one of these species were observed constructing and provisioning cells at the same time in close proximity on the same twig, thus suggesting gregarious nesting. The selection pressures which may have led to resin bees constructing such exposed and seemingly vulnerable brood cells are discussed briefly.

Both appear to be mature adults. Specimens with these two colour patterns have previously been reported in the literature but this paper presents the first record of their co-existence. We formally recognise the two forms based on colour pattern and note other morphological features that may also distinguish them. The validity of these additional characters requires confirmation through examination of further material.

N2  - The diet of a family of Rainbowbirds '(Merops ornatus' Latham) nesting in the Currimundi Environmental Park, southern Queensland, was investigated over approximately four months. Three birds were involved, a breeding pair and a helper male. Insect prey was monitored photographically with 836 items being recorded. The recorded diet of the adults before hatching and that brought to the nestlings differed considerably, with Hymenoptera being the most important adult prey class for adults, both numerically and in terms of biomass. However, few honeybees ('Apis mellifera' Linnaeus) were eaten by adults. Conversely, the most important components of the nestling diet in terms of biomass were cicadas, dragonflies (Anisoptera) and various Diptera. Large numbers of honeybees were also brought to the nestlings during their later development, particularly by the female bird and these comprised almost all the Hymenoptera fed to the nestlings. Lepidoptera, chiefly butterflies of all families, formed a minor but conspicuous part of the diet, particularly of the adults. Relatively fewer were fed to the nestlings, possibly because of the abundance of cicadas and dragonflies in the foraging territory.

N2  - The 'Polyrhachis aculeata' species-group of the subgenus 'Myrma' Billberg is reviewed. Seventeen species of the group are recognised, including nine previously described: 'Polyrhachis aculeata' Mayr, 'P. cybele' Wheeler, 'P. diana' Wheeler, 'P. gibbosa' Forel, 'P. hemiopticoides' Mukerjee, 'P. latona' Wheeler, 'P. murina' Emery, 'P. numeria' Fr. Smith and 'P. pubescens' Mayr. Two former subspecies, 'Polyrhachis murina selecta' Forel and 'P. pubescens alatisquamis' Forel, are raised to specific status and six species are described as new: 'Polyrhachis dimoculata', 'P. kebunraya', 'P. noonananti', 'P. palawanensis', 'P. starri' and 'P. watanasiti'. 'Polyrhachis alatisquamis' is redescribed and the previously unknown queens of 'P. cybele', 'P. latona' and 'P. pubescens' are described. A neotype of 'Polyrhachis pubescens' Mayr and a lectotype of 'P. murina' Emery are designated. A key to the species of the group is included. All species are illustrated and their known distributions summarised.

N2  - The biogeography, biology and taxonomy of the 'Euploea batesii' C. and R. Felder, 1865 'complex' from mainland Papua New Guinea and Torres Strait were studied and all specimens examined were grouped into one of three forms or morphological types. Immature stages of the immaculate form (Morph type 1) are described and illustrated from material collected on Mer Island, Torres Strait, where the larval host plant was 'Parsonsia velutina' R.Br. (Apocynaceae). On Mer Island, adults of several types were found in large numbers imbibing pyrrolizidine alkaloids from dead and damaged leaves and flowers of 'Heliotropium foertherianum' Diane and Hilger (Boraginaceae). The three morphological types were found to have distinctive sympatric and allopatric distributions, which might be determined by larval host plant specificity. Broadly, all three types occur in eastern Papua New Guinea and on Mer Island in Torres Strait, while only the immaculate type is known elsewhere in New Guinea and on other Torres Strait islands.  On Mer Island, captive mothers of the immaculate Morph type 1 produced final instar larvae that were charcoal black in colour and resulted in only immaculate Morph type 1 (F1) offspring; these F1 were not discernibly different from nominotypical 'E. batesii' from Indonesian West Papua. The distributions of the maculated types (Morph types 2 and 3) and several other butterfly species which are only known to occur in Torres Strait on Mer Island, support a probable link in the geological history of Mer Island and eastern Papua New Guinea. In addition, the distribution of the immaculate form indicates a link in the geological history of the islands in the west of Torres Strait to the southern region of mainland Papua New Guinea. The 'E. batesii' 'complex' likely includes more than one species, with perhaps more species occurring through the major islands and archipelagos along the Solomon chain east of New Guinea. Based on the distinct distributional and wing morphological differences occurring in populations in Papua New Guinea and Torres Strait, plus life history evidence, it is proposed that 'E. b. resarta' Butler be revised to species status ('E. resarta' Butler, 1876, stat. rev.) and that 'E. b. squalida' (Butler) be revised to a form of 'E. resarta' ('E. resarta f. squalida' (Butler, 1878), stat. rev.), both taxa occurring together exclusively in eastern mainland Papua New Guinea and on Mer Island. Also, the immaculate monotypic populations (Morph type 1) occurring on mainland New Guinea and its outlying islands and in Torres Strait are proposed as new synonyms of 'E. b. batesii'.

N2  - A review of the known distribution of 'Euploea darchia niveata' (Butler) showed that the taxon predominately occurs on mainland Queensland but also encompasses Thursday (Waiben) Island in the very south of Torres Strait. Based on this review, the record of a single female collected on Darnley (Erub) Island, Torres Strait in April 1910 by Hermann Elgner seems unusual. Despite Elgner's generally high standard in the veracity of his specimen labelling, this particular record is considered to be erroneous. Based on a reconstruction of Elgner's 1910 travels through Torres Strait by using data from specimen labels, a probable explanation for this record is that the specimen was collected on Thursday Island around 29 March 1910, prior to his departure for Darnley Island. On reaching Darnley on 3 April 1910 the specimen was then likely mistakenly labelled as originating from Darnley Island. The suggested narrower range of this taxon highlights the Australian endemic status of 'E. d. niveata'.

N2  - A standardised sampling procedure for ants, the ALL (Ants of the Leaf Litter) Protocol, was modified for use in temperate eucalypt forest. Terrestrial samples from leaf litter and pitfalls (the basic ALL Protocol) were supplemented with arboreal samples from tree traps. Four 200 m transects were sampled using the modified protocol within a 0.5 ha site on a forested property located near the mid-north coast of New South Wales. Site vegetation was mixed-age eucalypt forest, which had been undisturbed for more than 30 years. Tree traps captured a total of 54 species and 19 of these were absent from terrestrial samples. The addition of tree traps to the basic ALL Protocol: i) increased the number of species detected per species occurrence by an average of 20% per transect, with almost 2/3 of the increase due to species of 'Camponotus', 'Polyrhachis' and 'Myrmecia'; ii) increased the proportion of common species collected in transects, with less variation in species numbers between transects; and iii) provided a more comprehensive characterisation of this ant assemblage. Three groups of ants were present in the assemblage: 1) widespread species, active both in litter and on trees; 2) small litter-dwelling terrestrial species; and 3) larger species which were captured primarily on trees but were mostly ground-nesting. The genera of ants detected at the site were largely shared with similar east coast sites. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Australian Museum and images of the ants are available by email from the author.

N2  - Six species of psychopsoid neuropterans are recorded from the southeastern Queensland Late Triassic Blackstone Formation at Denmark Hill and Dinmore, the Late Triassic Mount Crosby Formation at Mount Crosby, and the early Middle Triassic Gayndah Formation at Gayndah. 'Triassopsychops superbus' Tillyard (previously known from Denmark Hill, newly recorded from Dinmore) has a suite of apomorphies confirming its earlier placement in Psychopsidae. Additional material of 'Osmylopsychops spillerae' Tillyard (type species of the family Osmylopsychopidae) (previously known from Denmark Hill and Mount Crosby, newly recorded from Dinmore) confirms the presence of a recurrent humeral vein and demonstrates its high degree of intra-specific variation in size and venation. 'Petropsychops superbus' Riek (previously known from Denmark Hill, newly recorded from Mount Crosby), with M and Rs uniquely structured basally, is retained in Osmylopsychopidae, although its strongly pectinate M is similar to some species of the Mesozoic psychopsoid family Kalligrammatidae. 'Archepsychops triassicus' Tillyard (Denmark Hill), possibly conspecific with 'O. spillerae', is known only from its fragmentary holotype and is retained for convenience in Osmylopsychopidae. Protopsychopsis venosa Tillyard (Denmark Hill) is known only from its holotype, which is too fragmentary to be considered any more than Neuroptera 'incertae sedis'. The sixth species, 'Gayndahpsychops carsburgi' gen. et sp. n., from the early Middle Triassic of Gayndah, is a small osmylopsychopid with CuA extensively pectinate.

Here we document several new distribution records from the arid zone of inland central and southern Western Australia (south of the Tropic of Capricorn) that suggest the species' extent of occurrence is considerably broader than previously realised and that it is likely to occupy much of the Eyrean Province where suitable habitat persists. Previous records of the closely related 'O. genoveva' (Hewitson, [1853]) from Western Australia are considered to be erroneous.

N2  - Mating behaviour in the majority of Australian Schizorhinini, the continent's largest tribe of Cetoniinae, varies little among species and generally consists of opportunistic mating without, or with minimal, courtship on the flowers of trees and shrubs. This paper describes morphological features and courtship and mating behaviour observed in captivity prior to copulation in the atypical Schizorhinini species 'Phyllopodium palmatum' (Schaum, 1848). Stridulation is produced metasternal-sternitaly, a method not described previously in Australian Cetoniinae, which was observed during courtship and in behaviour assumed to be defensive. Both sexes engaged in apparently stimulatory behaviour in courtship. The female was observed to bury into soil during mating, a behaviour possibly associated with avoiding predation. For the purpose of comparing 'Phyllopodium palmatum' with other Australian cetoniines, we present generalized mating and stridulation behaviour observed for 23 Australian cetoniines. For males, we describe a pair of large genital brushes - a structure that has not been reported previously for Cetoniinae and that might be novel in Coleoptera as a whole. Modifications to the phallobase of several other Australian Schizorhinini are described.

The new genus 'Paradacopsis' comprises only 'P. sulaensis' sp. n. from Sulawesi and Sula I., Indonesia. The male of 'Dacopsis signata' (Walker), previously misidentified as 'D. mantissa' (Hering), is recorded for the first time and illustrated. Where known, larvae of at least 'Austronevra' and 'Dacopsis' develop beneath the bark of newly felled or fallen logs.

N2  - The Mesopsychidae is an extinct family of Mecoptera now known to possess long siphonate mouthparts. Two species of mesopsychids are recorded from the Queensland Triassic: 'Mesopsyche triareolata' Tillyard from the Late Triassic Blackstone Formation at Denmark Hill and Dinmore and 'Mesoses gayndah' sp. n. from the early Middle Triassic Gayndah Formation at Gayndah. 'Mesopsyche triareolata' is important as the type species of the type genus of Mesopsychidae but our knowledge of its venation still relies on Tillyard's now out-dated original descriptions and illustrations. Based on a re-examination of all Denmark Hill type and previously recorded specimens, as well as newly collected material from Dinmore, a full description and new illustrations of its venation are provided in order to inform any future revision of 'Mesopsyche' Tillyard, which now includes a diverse assemblage of 10 species from the Permian and Triassic. 'Mesoses gayndah' sp. n., known only from the holotype forewing, is a much larger species that is very similar to the South African Late Triassic 'Mesoses magna' Riek. A preliminary diagnosis (based on the forewing only) of 'Mesoses' Riek notes its similarity to 'Mesopsyche', especially in sharing the distally placed, long, backwardly curved base of CuA, but differentiates it on the absence of costal crossveins, the longer and much more deeply forked Sc, the posteriorly curved branches of Rs and the more distal forking of MA relative to Rs.

N2  - 'Cethosia cydippe damasippe' C. and R. Felder, 1867 has previously been recorded only from New Guinea, while 'C. c. chrysippe' (Fabricius 1775) is endemic to Queensland, Australia, the two subspecies being separated by Torres Strait. We report two specimens of 'C. c. damasippe' collected from two of the three northernmost islands of Torres Strait that are within 10 km of the southern Papua New Guinea coastline, 'viz'. Saibai and Dauan. Although both specimens are possibly vagrants from Papua New Guinea, it is suggested that they might have originated from a resident population on Dauan Island, which has extensive areas of tropical semi-deciduous monsoon forest growing among granite boulders, a likely habitat for the as yet unrecorded larval host plant 'Adenia heterophylla' (Passifloraceae). This record is thus the first for 'C. c. damasippe' in Australian waters.

N2  - 'Toxala' Moulds was previously a monotypic genus of small grass cicadas known from central eastern Australia. A new species is described from the Herberton district in north Queensland, Australia, extending the distribution of this genus. The new species has been found in open grassy woodland with sparse heath elements, the adults of which are associated with grass and have been collected during late December to early January. The single known population appears to be highly localised and is potentially prone to habitat disturbance. Additional distribution records are provided for 'Toxala verna' (Distant) from southeastern Queensland. First documentation of the calling songs of the two 'Toxala' species is also provided, along with comparative notes.

N2  - The Bactrocera Macquart subgenus 'Parazeugodacus' Shiraki, 1933 (= Melanodacus Perkins, 1937, syn. n.) is reviewed and eight species included: 'B. (P.) abbreviata' (Hardy), 'B. (P.) bipustulata Bezzi', 'B. (P.) matsumurai' (Shiraki) and 'B. (P.) pendleburyi' (Perkins) from Asia, 'B. (P.) terminifer' (Walker) from Sulawesi, 'B. (P.) satanellus' (Hering) from Papua New Guinea, 'B. (P.) nigra' (Tryon) from Australia and 'B. (P.) fulvifacies' (Perkins) from New Caledonia. Four of these species are newly transferred: 'B. fulvifacies' from subgenus 'Zeugodacus' Hendel, 'B. nigra' and 'B. satanellus' from subgenus 'Melanodacus' and 'B. terminifer' from subgenus 'Paradacus' Perkins. Primary larval hosts are the fruit of olives (Oleaceae). Three Asian species currently included in 'Parazeugodacus', 'viz. B. arisanica' (Shiraki), 'B. fulvosterna' Drew and Romig and 'B. tetrachaeta' (Bezzi), are transferred to subgenus 'Hemizeugodacus' Hardy. Morphological characters suggesting monophyly of genus 'Bactrocera' are discussed, with those (plus host plant data) used to support a suggested elevation of 'Zeugodacus' to genus all homoplasious.
