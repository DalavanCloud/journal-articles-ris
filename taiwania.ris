N2  - An experiment on the culture of Physarum cinereum from sp or e to spore on sterilized bark and leaves in a moist chamber has been completed. The swarm cells escape through a deep wedge-shaped rupture in the spore walls. The posterior end of the swarm cell has a contractile vacuole and also sends out pseudopodia. They may be fused at their posterior ends. The swarm cell has flagella of equal length. One of the flagella is usually directed more or less straight forward, while the other is directed posteriorly at an angle greater than 90˚ from the first. The plasmodium belongs to the type of phaneroplasmodium, which is almost colorless or watery-white. By using single spore cultures it has been proved that a single myxamoeba is capable of producing a plasmodium, which indicates that this organism is homothallic. Ultra-thin sections of the spore have been made, and the structures have been photographed under the electron microscope.

N2  - The pollen grains of three families, i. e., the Chloranthaceae, Piperaceae, and Saururaceae incIuding six genera and eleven species have been studied. Pollen morphology among species of the same genus is frequently similar, but pollen grains of these different genera are sufficiently different so that they usually can be distinguished readily, excepting members of Houttuynia, Saururus, and Piper. On the basis of pollen morphology, plants of Piperaceae are closely related to those of Saururaceae.

N2  - Germination of the oospores of Chara contraria Kützing and C. zeylanica Willd. was investigated with respect to the effect of a variety of environmental factors, among them, photoperiod, presence or absence of oxygen, culture medium, and temperature. The results indicated that the oospores of the species investigated require a period of dormancy before germination. This period may be shortened by treatment at low temperature (5° to 7℃), but if t his is omitted, germination follows ultimately, but is delayed. Germination occurs under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, contrary to reports in the literature. The ontogeny of the protonema and of the primary axis in early germination has been described for Chara contraria and is essentially similar to the general pattern described by earlier investigators for other species of the genus. Studies of the organism in culture indicated clearly the important role of the rhizoids in generating secondary protonemata and, thus, in the colonization of a given substrate.The species of Chara are submerged aquatics attached to the substrate by rhizoids. They are colonial plants and form dense patches on the bottom of fresh and brackish bodies of water. Some grow in deep water, some in shallow, some in still water and some in rapidly running streams; perennial species grow intermingled with annual ones. They prefer oligotrophic waters and never grow in water which is polluted.In nature, as streams and ditches containing Chara become dry, the oospores remain as agents of survival during dormancy. When the rain again fills dry stream beds, the oospores germinate and start a new generation. Oospores in nature, however, also germinate in habitats where they are not subjected to desiccation.The writer has been interested in studying the early morphogenesis of Chara, and undertook experiments to germinate the oospores of Chara contraria and C. zeylanica.Ross (1959), Proctor (1960), Carr and Ross (1963) and Forsberg (1965) have reported some of their experiments on germination of the oospores of different species of Chara. Carr and Ross, and Forsberg all emphasize the requirement of anaerobic condition for the germination of the oospore of Chara.The writer devised an agar-plate method as a convenient way of germinating Chara oospores. With this method, the development and morphogenesis of the sporelings of Chara contraria were studied.The materials used were oospores of Chara contraria collected from the dried plants and from mud, and oospores collected from the living plants of C. zeylanica. The method of selection and sterilization of the oospores for germination is described as follows: Oospores were separated from the soil particles and debris layer by means of a series of soil-sieves, and were retained in the finest U. S. standard sieve number 70 with nominal openings of 0.21 mm. The oospores were then picked out with a small forceps under the stereoscopic binocular microscope, and were washed and sterilized as follows. The oospores were immersed in detergent solution, sonicated mechanically for 10 sec., washed, and then rinsed with sterilized water ten times. The oospores were then sterilized by adding 3 drops of Clorox to the tube containing 6 ml of water, and oospores were left in Clorox for 1 min. and then washed with sonication, five times.The clean, sterilized oospores were introduced into Petri dishes with sterilized 2% plain agar. The oospores were then picked up from the agar surface with flamed needles or small forceps and arranged separately on Petri dishes containing proteose yeast-extract agar. These plates were then stored in an incubator of 37℃ three days for testing the presence of bacteria. If any bacteria were present, the bacterial colonies were obvious around the Chara oospores. Only sterile oospores were picked out and planted.

N2  - The anatomy and some submicroscopic cellular structures in the root cap of developing adventitious root of Ceratopteris thalictroides were studied. The root cap initial originates from the single apical cell in the root meristem by means of sequencial segmentation. The root cap initial then follows an orderly cell division to give rise to a multicellular root cap since the cap cells are traceable to their common origin or to the apical cell. The cap cells increase considerably in size as they develop. During the course of cap cell development, the nucleus is still present with little increase in size and the nucleolus appears to be absent in older root cap cell. Most of the cytoplasmic organelles maintain rather complete figures even in the sloughing off cells except the plastids. The possible significance of wall structure in relation to the process of sloughing off is discussed. The root cap shows characteristic features which lead to the consideration that the root cap may be an acting or modified multiseriate epidermis.

N2  - Three species of the phycobiont Trebouxia have been described in this investigation. On the basis of this study, all the algal symbionts isolated from the four species of lichens, namely, Anaptychia comosa, A. dendricata, Parmelia caperata, and P. rudecta, collected in Taiwan, belong to Trebouxia Group II. The results show that different species of lichens contain the morphologically identical algae (e. g. symbionts of A. comosa, and A. dendricata,) and that at times the same species of lichen may contain physiologically different forms of algal symbiont (e.g. P. caperata as compared in this study with my previous study, Wang-Yang, 1965). However, at the species level, lichen fungi are not highly specific with regard to their algal partners.

N2  - It has been found in the study of Dendrobium kwashotense Hay. that the various root tissues arise in regular sequence from the root apical meristem. The detailed anatomical and histological analysis shows that the adhesive roots, i. e., the roots attached to a solid substrate, are more adapted for the water absorption, since they have root hairs, smaller cells in the velamen and many thin walled passage cells in exodermis. On the contrary, the aerial roots, i. e., the roots developed freely in the air, possess no root hairs and have many thick walled exodermal passage cells which are covered by lignified and subcrized secondary walls. The exodermis consists of long and short (passage) cells; they regularly interpose each other. The exodermis is suggested to be the main barrier of the water path in orchid roots and the structure of exodermal cells are considered to play an important role in regulation of water absorption. The exodermal passage celles are compared to the potential root hairs in the root epidermis of angiosperms. The orderly arrangement of endodermal cells in relation to the distribution of protoxylem is described. The sequence of initiation, differentiation and maturation of various tissues in the vascular cylinder is also studied.

N2  - The structure of C. pteridoides is almost identical with that of C. thalictroides, except in the former species the root shows somewhat less orderliness regarding the arrangement of lateral roots. The occurrence of lateral roots is related to the leaf rather than to the root apical cell. Since the new immediate lateral derivative of the apical cell is always produced beside the oldest cell of the three surrounding cells cut off from the three side faces of the apical cell, it is suggested that the regular formation of the new cells in cyclic order from the apical cell is dependent on the simultaneous presence of its surrounding cells of different ages. Since the walls of the rootcap are always thicker than those of the meristematic cells in the root tip, it is thought that this relative inflexible rootcap may act as a mould, contributing to nance of a definite form of the root tip by casting a mass of flexible cells of the the mainteapical meristem in it. The formation of rootcap is found essential in the construction of root proper in this fern.

N2  - Six species of the phycobionts, Trebouxia, have been successfully isolated and cultured from Taiwan fruticose lichens, mainly from the family of Cladoniaceae. It has been reported that algal symbionts isolated from fruticose lichens (i. e. Stereocaulon, Cladonia, Pilophorus) (Ahmadjian 1960) all belonged to Group I. But based on this investigation, Taiwan fruticose lichens contain phycobionts Trebouxia from both Group I and Group II. It has been further assumed that distinct species of lichens, contain the same phycobionts, (at least, at the species level), but many forms of Trebouxia which differ both morphologically and physiologically, occur in the same species of lichens

N2  - Spores and plasmodium of Reticularia lycoperdon Bull, were sectioned by electron microscopy. Organelles have been studied and described. The mitochondria were found particularly clear in both spores and plasmodium. The spore walls were thick, with coarse protuberances and usually were surrounded by a delicate slimy layer. Nuclear division were occasionally observed before the spore ruptured. The emerging of the swarm cells, possibly 1-4 from each spore, came out through a crack (6) in the wall. Some of the swarm cells were transformed into myxamoebae shortly after emerging. The myxamoebae moved rapidly, each showed only one flagellum at the tapering end. Fibrils were seen when protoplasmic streaming was active. The spore to spore culture was completed in about 16 days and this is the first time it has been reported in science.

N2  - This report is a continuation of my studies on Pleione formosana Hayata and deals with the internal structure and differentiation of the roots, pigmentation, variation and differentiation of unfertilized flowers (Chen, 1968).The primordia of adventitious roots are hidden in the unbroken buds, with numbers ranging from several (3 or 4) to thirty. In the transection of the mature root, there are two to several layers of velamen whose cytoplasm and nucleus disappears from the cell that enclosed the cylinder. They are strongly lignified and easily shed. The exodermis takes the place of the function of velamen after the latter dies. Cortical cells are nearly circular and isodiametric. Beneath the endoderm, there are 2 to 3 layers of thick-walled cells surrounding the vascula bundle. The pericycle is absent. The central pith is concealed by radiate vascular tissue. In the longisection of the root, all the tissues originate from one group of initials, i. e. root cap, velamen, cortex and vascular cylinder are all differentiated from one group of cells.The flowers of Pleione are dioecious are epigynous. They contain a 3-carpeled ovary and an anther with floral appendages. During the blooming period, cross-pollination occurs. After pollination both the pollen and the nucellus ripen. In the apical meristem a second flower remains undeveloped. The natural occurrence of a second and a third flower on one scape is an evidence of its tendency to form a spike.By analyzing the pigments in purple flowers it is found that there are four pigment groups, i. e., anthocyanins, flavones, flavonols and aurones. But in white flowers only flavones and aurones are found. The result on the paper chromatogram shows that six kinds of anthocyanins are found in flowers and these are different from those in pseudobulbs. The maximum absorption of the anthocyanin extract is at 520 mµ.The abscission of the leaf is almost the same as that of the pedicel. The nuclei disappear and cell walls do not stain with safranin in the cells beyond the abscission layer, but the cells connected with the plant body are lignified and stain red with safranin.

N2  - Leafy gametophytes of Haplomitrium rotundifolium developed from spores have been completed in antiseptic culture in the present laboratory (6), (7) & (8). However, no sexuality occurred in these artificially developed gametophytes. This study attempts to detect whether external factors such as light sources and chemicals may bring some morphological or physiological changes, which may, in turn, induce sexuality to this unique liverwort in antiseptic culture. After six months of observation, under chemical treatment including GA, IAA, NAA and Vitamins and the application of red light, at 9 hour exposure daily, under 20℃, showed successful results on the initiation of sex organ on the gametophyte of Haplomitrium rotundifolium. GA 10^(-6)M/1 seemed to induce the formation of primary archegonia consisting of few cells only, at the surface of the shoot tip. Red light at 9 hr illumination, showed the occurrence of archegonia, in mature stage on the tip of the shoot (Pl. III, 1-6). These findings, the antiseptic gametophyte completed in this laboratory in former years and initiation of sex organs in the present research are all first time reports to the biological science.

N2  - The anatomical and histological studies were made on the developing roots of more than ten species of orchids from Taiwan. The present investigation has revealed that with the exception of the apical organization, the various tissues in all the roots show very similar patterns. In which, as is seen in transverse sections from the periphery of the root centripetally, they can regularly be celled velamen; a uniseriate thick walled exodermis with short and ling cells which are interposed with each other; a multiseriate parenchymatous cortex proper; a one cell layered, thick-walled endodermis which is interrupted by the thin-walled cells (endodermal passage cells) at the regions opposite to every protoxylem pole; a central stele with several groups of xylem and the same unmber of groups of phloem peripherally arranged surrounding the sclerified pith. The variation of some tissues, especially the velamen, are here discussed based on phylogeny as well as on environmental conditions. The uniseriate velamen more strongly retains the nature of a normal epidermis than does the multiseriate ones. The multiseriate velamen may have lost its original function of absorption during its phylogenetic advancement.

N2  - The external morphology as well as the differentiation and maturation of the vascular tissue of the root and initiation of lateral root in Ceratopteris thalictrcides (L.) Brongn. are studied. At maturity leaf length is negatively correlated with leaf age. The initial cells of all tissues of the root are present a few cells behind the apical cell. The sequence of the differentiation and maturation of each tissue is strictly constant. Metzxylem appears first but matures last among all of the other vascular tissues. Protophloem is identified next to the metaxlem and matures before the protoxylem appears, then protoxylem matures before the metzxylem matures. The lateral root initial arises in the endodermis at about five cells behind the apical cell. The endodermis matures and after protoxylem maturation. The air spaces arise schizogenously very close to the apical cell usually before the curliest metaxylem appears. The lateral root is derived endogenously from a single enlarged endodermal cell at a definite place. But no other morphologically difference can be seem in this special lateral root initial.

N2  - The arrangement of the tissue systems and histology of the stem and tendril of Parthenocissus tricuspidata (Sieb. & Zucc.) Planch. have been studied. The arrangement of the tissue systems in the stem is fundamentally the same as that in both stalk and holdfast of the tendril. The stem possessed a rather large amount of ground tissue in comparison with other tissues. The tendril stalk has a less amount of living cells, but a larger amount of xylem. The xylem is reduced in the holdfast. The peculiar development of the epidermal cells on the attached surface of the holdfast has also been described. Each epidermal cell on the attached surface of the holdfast elongates and undergoes cell divisions to become a hair-like structure after it comes in contact with a substrate. Other cellular changes also occur in these epidermal cells.

N2  - The germination of pollen grains collected from a long period blooming flower (Lily, Lilium longiflorum) and a short period blooming flower (Dish-Cloth Gourd, Luffa cylindrica) was studied. It was found that the germination pattern of the two plants was quite different.The protein content in germinating pollen of lily increased steadily and reached a maximum in 90 minutes and then decreased. In contrast, gourd pollen had a larger amount of protein content before germination and decreased gradually during germination. It seems that for pollen germination, the lily required the synthesis of some new proteins but the gourd did not. The hypothesis was further proved by the cycloheximide inhibition test for protein synthesis. When cycloheximide was added to the germinating pollen at the beginning, lily pollen tube elongation was entirely inhibited, whereas gourd tube elongation continued. From the pattern of protein metabolism during germination, the mechanism for the initiation of the tube elongation of these two kinds of pollen may be different. RNA metabolism and free amino acids tended to increase.Based on the cycloheximide inhibition test, the germination patterns of eleven species of pollen grains could be separated into two groups, one was similar to the gourd type and the other belonged to the lily type.

N2  - Fourteen species of bacteria were isolated from diseased grass-carps, Ctenopharyngodon idllus. After identification and inoculation tests, one of these bacteria(A-2), Aeromonas punctata Zimmermann, was found to be a pathogen for the grass carp.Aeromones punctata is a gram negative, rod-shaped bacteria, motile by means of a single polar flagellum. It is able to digest gelatin, casein and sulfide, methyl red and acetylmethylcarbinol tests. It ferments most carbohydrates with the production of acid and gas.Aeromonas punctata is sensitive to many kinds of antibiotics and sulfonamides, but chloramphenicol was found to be the most efficient antibiotic in controlling this pathogen.

N2  - Eight kinds of mycobionts of Taiwan fruticose lichens were cultivated and produced a basic type of colony. Observations on the single-spore cultures, morphological differentiation of fungal symbionts of these lichens were made. The mycobionts from fruticose lichens were compact, hard in consistency. The cultivated mycobionts rarely produced pigment and also did not produce reproductive structures. Experlmental evidence shows that different algae in lichens are associated with different fungi.

N2  - The control mechanism of stored foods degradation during seed germination was studied. When one excised cotyledon was incubated with three embryonic axes, it was found that the embryonic axis may stimulate the proteinase activity, RNA synthesis, and reserve protein breakdown in the excised cotyledons. Cytokinins may replace the embryonic axis function and stimulate the proteinase activity and RNA synthesis in the excised cotyledous. It is evident that the soybean cotyledon contains more than one proteolytic enzyme. The experimental results show that the embryonic axis may affect de kovo synthesis of the peak b component of the proteolytic enzyme.A possible explanation for these results is that the synthesis of proteolytic enzyme in the cotyledons of soybean seedlings is controlled by the embryonic axis and the hormone involed appears to be a cytokinin.

N2  - A mature archegonium of Ceratopteris thalictroides (L.) Brongn. consists of a short neck with three to five (typically four) tiers of cells curved backward away from the notch, an enlarged venter surrounded by a layer of sterite jacket cells and an axial row of a binucleate neck canal cell, a ventral canal cell and an egg. The archegonium is derived from the archegonial initial together with its surrounding prothallial cells rather than just from a single initial as commonly thought. Furthermore it was observed that the archegonial initial also gives rise to the prothallial tissue which is not related to archegomium.

N2  - This work is concerned with cell division and nuclear abnormalities in the root apical cell and its close derivatives of a water fern, Ceratopteris pteridoides (Hook.) Hieron. when grown either in the presence or absence of a colchicine solution. The apical cells of rapidly growing roots divide-mainly after midnight. An important consequence of applying colchicines is the formation of multinucleate cells. The formation of ameboid nuclei and other nucleotoxic effect occur as the time of colchicine is prolonged. By counting the number of nuclei formed after a 24 hour-colchicine-treatment, the nuclear cycle of the apical cells in some of the roots of this fern seems to be very short. It was estimated about as 8 hours or shorter. It never divides less frequently than its adjacent cells. The concept that the apical cell in pteridophytes is an ”unicellular quiescent center” suggested by some workers is also discussed.

N2  - Chromosome counts of 64 taxa belonging to 47 genera and 12 families are reported in this study. The tribe Ophiopogoneae of the lily family, Liliaceae, and the genus Dendrobium of the orchid family. Orchidaceae, have been studied intensively using living materials cultivated in Taipei. Some effort has been made to make a cyto-taxonomical study of the plants from Lanhsü Island (Botel Tobago) where the flora is not yet completely known. A total of 21 taxa have been investigated. A brief synopsis for the tribe Ophiopogoneae of the lily family is proposed for Taiwan species, and a new basic number of X = 9 is suggested. In the genus Dendrobium, it seems there are three groups of plants that can be recognized based on the characters of the pseudobulbs and the leaves, and on their different basic chromosome number, i.e. X =10, X = 19, and X = 15. Of the chromosome studies made, 29 taxa are reported here for the first time. Most of these are of the endemic members of the orchid family.

N2  - Karyotypes of 13 species of 9 genera and 3 families of gymnosperms have been studied. The chromosome number and/or karyotype analysis of 6 species had been reported by previous workers. The karyotypes of the remaining species are reported here by the present authors for the first time. The diploid chromosome number in Pinaceae is 24, while it is 22 in both the Taxiodiaceae and Cupressaceae. For all Formosan species, the karyotypes of Pinus are similar. The secondary constriction of a chromosome may be a useful character for identification of species. SAT-chromosome have been found in the genus Cunninghamia. The karyotypes of Pinus are symmetrical while they are asymmetrical for the other genera of Pinaceae. Pinus is considered to be the most primitive taxon among genera of Pinaceae. A key for identification of these genera based on their karyotypes has been prepared.

N2  - The senescence of excised primary leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris L. was followed by measuring the net breakdown of chlorophyll, protein, RNA, proteinase and ribonuclease activity. A decline of chlorophyll, protein, and RNA mark the progress of senescence in excised leaves. The chemical growth regulators, indoleacetic acid and gibberellic acid, were relatively ineffective in retarding senescense. N5-Benxyladenine at the concentration of 1 x 10^(-5)M was effective in retarding the decline in the amount of chlorophyll, protein and RNA. In the dark, L-serine at the concentration of 3 x 10^(-2)M promoted yellowing and RNA degradation of excised Ieaves. But in the light, it was ineffective in promoting senescence. Fluorescent light of 1,000 Lux, was very effetive in senecence retardation. In the dark, adding sucrose (5.8 x 10^(-2)M) to the culture medium replaced the light function in retarding the chlorophyll, protein by cycloheximide (5 μg/ml). It is assumed that, upon excision of leaves, the synthesis of some m-RNA responsible for synthesis of destructive enzymes is activated, which ultimately Ieads to the breakdown of RNA and the protein synthesizing machinery. The protein inhibitors could then be expected to temporarily retard chlorophyll breakdown primarily by inhibiting the synthesis of destructive enzymes. The role of light and N5-Benzyladenine in the retardation of senescence may act synchrononously.

N2  - Growth habit and both internal and external structure of root of Ophioglossum petiolatum Hook. were investigated. It was found that the sporophyte of this plant possesses many characteristics which are highly adapted to a dry terrestrial habitat. Although the roots are without root hairs, the internal structure of the root shows that the smooth surface of root epidermis is the side of water absorption. The Casparian strip is no t continuous, but rather is broken by many minute pores. This observation leads us to suggest that these openings function in promoting the periclinal translocation of suger from the sieve cells to every endodermal cells, so that the endodermis may proceed smoothly in its osmotic absorption of water into the stele.

N2  - When Fuligo cinerea (Schw.) Morg. of Taiwan arrived in my laboratory, it was a huge, yellow mass of plasmodium. In the next day it changed its color into brown or black and aethalia of various sizes were observed. Spore germination revealed a germination rate of 50%, which was probably determined by the age of spores. Swarm cells emerged by a slit in the wall usually one cell escaped from one spore. Biflagellated swarm cells produced synchronously were observed. Both yellow and colorless plasmodia were observed. Veins, fans and clamps were vivid and vigorous streaming occurred nearly in all the cultures. Myxamoebae of both large sized and smaller ones were observed. Sclerotia of angular cysts and microcysis often formed under unfavorable conditions. When the plasmodia became drier and smaller, fructification and sporulation followed. It takes about 18 days to complete the life cycle of Fuligo cinerea.

N2  - The sample for this palynological study were taken from a sedimentary deposit in the central part of the Taipei Basin, namely the Taipei Botanical Garden. Soil was sampled to a depth of 44.8m. and covered all ranges of the Sungshan Gravel Deposit. According to the different sediments, 16 samples were chosen for study. The soil composition was analysed by the methods of Bouyoucus (1936) and Day (1950, 1953). Pollen grains were extracted by chemical deflocculation by a modified Nakamura's method (1967), then permanent slides were prepared and sealed with paraffin. Based on the examination of all the permanent slides, a hypothesis was formulated for the successive series of plant communities of the Taipei Basin based on Sungshan Deposit from about 380,000 to 4,500 years B.P. as follow:Palmae, Cycadaceae, Cyperaceae of Tropical sunny wet lands elements (43.5 m.)→Fagaceae, Moraceae, Theacae, Elaeocarpaceae of Subtropical with increasing cool temperate forest elements (36.5-31.9 m.)→Aceraceae, Fagaceae, Theaceae, Aquifoliaceae, Betulaceae and Elaeocarpaceae of Warm temperate forest (23.6-19.3 m.)→Betulaceae, Cyperaceae of Subtropical forest elements (16.6 m.)→Aquifoliaceae, Pinaeae, Juglandaceae and Trochodendraceae of Warm temperate forest (15.7-13.6 m.)→Fagaceae, Betulaceae, Myricaeae, Pinaceae of Subtropical forest (11.5-9.3 m.)→Myricaceae, Elaeocarpaceae, Pinaceae, Betulaceae, Fagaceae of Subtropical forest elements (7.2-1 m.)

N2  - Isaria sp., a caprophilous fungus, has been intensively studied and found to have produced at least 4 kinds of conidiospores during the course of its development. Macroconidiospores are thick-walled, and often found in a binucleate stage; these are oval and borne in a terminal cluster on short curved conidiophores, covering almost the entire surface of the synnema. The thin-walled microconidiospores are of three kinds, the spherical, and the rod shaped, which are usually irregularly arranged in loose clusters, and the oidia, the free hyphal cells breaking up from hyphal tips.Both macro- and microconidiosporeds may multiply by mitosis- this is more frequently noted in the macroconidispores-or the budding.Isaria (Spicaria) species are all entomogenous, parasitic on insects but the present fungus is saprophytic on caprophilous habitat.The main characteristic of the present fungus consists of its white synnema; and hyaline, one-called ovoid spores, which cover most of the surface of the synnema. These characteristics closely resemble Isaria cretacea (Barnett, 1960), but it is parasitic on insects rather than being saprophytic on dung. This species has not been previously reported in Taiwan.

N2  - With both conventional and modern techniques the author undertakes to determine the proper systematics of the lady ferns of the genus Athyrium found in North America north of Mexico. A taximetric comparison of ninety-nine characters by the computer program working on a non-statistical optimization measure of cluster analysis (Rubin, 1966) is used to test the validity of conclusions reached by other methods. A semi-objective graphic evaluation of their phylogenetic relationship is considered by the grourd plan method (Wagner, 1961). Both analyses produce results essentially similar to those reached by biosystematic studies, namely that there are two distantly related lineages in Athyrium, one comprising the silvery athyrium and glade fern, the other the common and the alpine lady ferns. The glade fern is found to be a highly specialized member of its group, as is also the American alpine lady fern. Thus, there are four distinct species of Athyrium with the single species of lady fern consisting of three subspecies with geographically distinct ranges.

N2  - Although Metasequoia occidentalis (Newberry) Chaney is now known to have been widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere during the Tertiary, including abundant remains in Japan as late as the Pliocene, it has never been previously reported from Taiwan. In 1971 the author discovered carbonized compressions of leafy branches and a single ovulate cone of Metasequoia in an argillaceous shale in the Middle Miocene Shihti Formation southeast of Taipei. In addition, numerous pollen grains of the taxodiaceous type were recovered by maceration of the matrix containing the macrofossil material, as well as from the underlying coal beds of the same age.

N2  - A study of the root apical meristems of three species of ferns, Ophioglossum petiolatum Hook, Ceratopteris thalictrcides (L.) Brongn, and Marsilea crenata Pr. has been made. These ferms were cultured in both the presence and absence of colchicine. The apical cells of some colchicines treated roots showed either a multinucleate condition or other abnormalities, whereas the apical cells of all non-treated roots were mononucleate. All the roots of these three species formed tumors after treatment. The typical c-metaphasic nucleus which has frequently been observed in angiosperms was not seen in this experiment. Apparently the dividing cells of pteri-dophytes show a different pattern from those in angiosperms in response to the action of colchicines.It is clear that the root apical cells in these three species always divide more frequently than their adjacent cells. Among these, the root apical cells in Ceratopteris divides more frequently than the other two species. The presence of a quiescent center in the root apical meristem in these ferns has not been verified.

N2  - The samples for this palynological study were taken from a sedimentary deposit in the northeast section of the Taipei Basin, namely the Neihu District. Soil was sampled to a depth of 34.5 m, and covered all ranges of the Sungshan Deposit. Altogether sixty-four families, including 12 families of pteridophyta, 5 families of gymonsperms and 47 families of angiosperms were identified. The successive serics of plant communities of the Neihu area of Taipei Basin were based on the Sungshan Deposit from about 380,000 to 4,500 years B.P. as follow:Convolvulaceae, Cycadaceae, Typhaceae, Cyperaceae of Tropical plants (33.6 m) →Pinaceae, Taxodiaceae, Moraceae, Convolvulaceae, Magnoliaceae, Solanaceae, Fagaceae of Subtropical forests with increasing Warm temperate elements (31.5 m) →Taxodiaceae, Pinaceae, Fagaceae, Elaeocarpaceae and Magnoliaceae of Warm temperate forests (25.2 m) →Palmae, Cycadaceae, Apocynaceae, Fagaceae, Betulaceae, Pinaceae and Euphorbiaceae of Tropical to Subtropical forests (16.5 m, 6.5 m) →Taxodiaceae, Pinaceae, Juglandaceae and Trochodendraceae of Warm temperate forests (5.5 m) →Magnolizceae, Pandansceae, Moraceae, Betulaceae and Fagaceae of Subtropical forests (5-1 m).

N2  - Mitochondria capable of oxidative phosphorylation and respiratory control have been isolated from Solanum tuberosum L. using polyvinylpyrrolidone as a complexing agent for oxidizing compounds formed during cellular disruption. An intermittent low speed centrifugation at 200 x g combined with isolation medium containing mannitol, bovine serum albumin and cysteine proved satisfactory for the sendimentation of starch and separation of functional mitochondria having high protein content.Isolated mitochondria were found to be actively oxidizing substrates such as succinate, malate and pyruvate. The efficiency of oxidative phosporylation approaches the expected maxima. As expressed by the P:O ratio and measured polarographically by oxygen electrode it is 1.6. A similar method of investigation evidenced tight coupling of respiratory activity with oxidative phosphorylation, the rate of which is regulated by adenosine diphosphate. This ratio of respiratory control is found to be 4.1.Some information on the cytochrome components of potato mitochondria is obtained. The activities of DPNH and succinate cytochrome c reductases have been demonstrated. They are found to absolutely require lipids for their normal functioning.Test on storage effect revealed that the best method of preservation for isolated mitochondria from potato is deep freezing in liquid nitrogen.

N2  - The authors have made an attempt to develop a practical method for the separation of bromelain and starch from pineapple stems. The bromelain was obtained either by the acetone method or by the tannic acid method. Results showed that most bromelain was precipitated in the 40-50% acetone concentration, also that most bromelain was precipitated when 2-4g of tannic acid were added per liter, under these condition the highest specific enzyme activity was obtained.The biochemical properties of crude enzyme were; optimal temperature 57℃; optimal pH 7.0; while Zn++ inactivated and Mg++ activated it to the highest degree.Crude bromelain was made to separate the components by means of dise-alectrophoresis. Six bands can be recognized in the zymo-graphs, whether the bromelain was obtained by the acetone method or tannic acid method.The pineapple stem starches are spherical granules of about 11μ in diameter. Although the granules are easily broken, a typical granule has a Y-shaped fissure in its central area. Using chloral hydrate technique to prepare amylase and amylopectin and direct scale readings of a mixture of amylase and amylopectin, the results indicated that the amylase content of pineapple stem starch is 36%.

N2  - 1. Zwei Tageslängeunempfindliche und zwei empfindliche Sorten wurden in der zweiten Kulturperiode 1970 in Sandkultur mit Kasugailösung gezogen. Sie wurden drei photoperiodischen Behandlungen, 8-Stunden Tag, 24-Stunden Tag, Naturtag unterzogen. Für alle Tageslängen wurden die Pflanzen in vier Gruppen mit verschiedener Nährlösung geteilt, Kontrolle, EDTA-Fe, EDTA-Fe + Glukose, EDTA-Fe + Glikose + 5'UMP. 2. Bei allen Tageslängen hatte die EDTA- Fe Gruppe win kürzere Ausschusszeit, wie die EDTA- Fe + Glukose Grupe, die fast dieselbe Ausschusszeit wie die Kontrollgruppe hatte. Die latzte Gruppe hatte die kürzeste Ausschusszeit. Das scheint zu zeigen dass die Anwesenheit von Uridyleäure eine Verküzung der Ausschusszeit zur Folge hat.

N2  - It is estimated that the growing cell culture of sycamore consumes approximately 50% of its metabolic energy for protein synthesis. This finding indicates that (1) the plant cell culture is a highly efficient system in which most of energy obtained from respiration can be accounted for; (2) protein synthesis is indeed an expensive process and needs to be regulated.

N2  - Development of polyad grain of Calliaudra haematocephala Hassk. was studied. Electron microscopy technique preparation was adapted for this study. That is, pre-fix in glutaraldehyde, post-fix in osmium tetraoxide, dehydrate in acetone, embed in plastics, cut with ultramicrotone, thick section (1μ thick) stained with methylene blue-azure II, examine under light microscope, Different developmental stages, namely, undifferentiated, one-, two-, four-, five-, six-, and eight-celled stages were revealed. Each nuclear division is followed immediately by cytokinensis which is common in Monocotyledons and also found in this species. Sporopollenin starts adding on the surface when 4-celled stage is reached (wall formation). Although cell plate has already separated two daughter cells away but sporopolleninous wall had not appeared a t that time. Longitudinally, there can be several octads formed from each locule, however, horizontally there is only on e expected a t the same level. In other words, there was only one pollen mother cell existing at the initiation stag Accompanying events, such as tapetal layer (development and disintegration), and reinforcement of endothecial cells are also reported.

N2  - The annual rhythm of cambial activity in guava tree, Psidium guajava Linn., was investigated. The period of cambial activity is very long. It begins in early February and ends in November. The most conspicuous stage of cambial activity is seen to be in early June. When the temperature gradually rises the cambial activity increases. But it slows down as the average temperature exceeds 28˚C. The foliar buds burst after the beginning of the cambial activity. The relation between the flowering period and the cambial activity shows less correlation.

N2  - The idea that woodiness in otherwise largely herbaceous genera is a basic feature of the ecosystem of oceanic islands is found to be redundant. Woodiness in such genera is also not confined to islands; a scanning of all cases in Hawaii learned that of all these genera woodiness is also found in continental area. The wrong impression of its uniqueness has probably originated because, as with many other so-called characteristic Island features, no comparative studies w re made with situations in continental areas. Ratios of woodiness on islands and continent cq. continental areas must still be computed.It is sometimes advanced that woodiness in oceanic islands is due to the not ably moderate climate of such island permitting continued growth and that there is a natural sleeting active for plant that are of longer duration, suiting the year-long growing season of such insular islands, an explanation recently phrased by Carlquist in a study on the endemic species of Echium in Macaronesia.In my experience it is in these two island groups as varied as it can b imagined to be on any place of the same size anywhere in the world. And I object against the use of the term natural selection here as it is in these volcanic areas precisely the lack of competition; the prevelance of bare soil and open niches provides natural opportunity for the origin of different life forms unhampered by competition and genomes may show what they are capable of to produce in the patio ludens of form making. In agreement with this is the occurrence of striking, rare life forms in the volcanic areas of East Africa and the Andes.

N2  - This is a continuation of our investigation of the Taiwan mucoraceous fungi. Ten species of Mucorales from soil, air, and animal dung are presented in this paper. They are Mucor advantitius, M. circinelloides, M. corticolus, M. falcatus, M. griseo-lilacinus, M. piriformis, Pilobolus crystallinus, Phycomyces nitens, Syncephalis cornu, and Syncephalustrum racemosum, all these are reported as new to the fungal flora of Taiwan. All of them were carefully studied, and specific characters decribed. Tests for zygospore formation were made between the various collections of the same or closely related species, but none were induced. All of the pure cultures which were isolated are therefore presumably heterothallic.

N2  - By simultaneously measuring amino acid incorporation and respiration, it is estimated that in germinating barley seeds, only 1% of the energy released from inspiration is use for protein synthesis. This estimate is based on the assumption that (1) all O2 absorbed by the seeds is used for respiration; combustion of 1 glucose with the aid of 6 O2 yields 36 ATP; (2) protein synthesis involves assembly of preformed amino acids; the main energy expenditure is for making peptide bonds; formation of each peptide link requires 4 ATP; (3) specific radioactivity of the amino acid in the incubation medium reflects that of the precursor pool inside the seeds. The first and the third assumptions could be incorrect, therefore, the actual energy consumption for protein synthesis might be much higher.

N2  - The enzymatic hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotide monophosphate in barley seedlings (Hordeum vulgare L., cucltivar Himalaya) was investigated. Multiple forms of enzyme activity toward adenosine-2', 3'-cyclic monophosphate are observed. At least one of these is capable of catalyzing the hydrolysis of adenosine-3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate. Adenosine is the sole product from the hydrolysis of cyclic AMP because of the presence of nucleotidase activity. Further studies on substrate specificity, sedimentation behavior, pH optimum, metal ion effect, dithiothreitol effect and Km valued suggest that the hydrolysis of cyclic nucleoside monophosphate may be due to a nonspecific acid phosphatase.

N2  - Virus-specific RNA was isolated from cells transformed by human adenovirus 2 by two cycles of hybridizations and elusions with adenovirus 2 DNA. Viral RNA was resistant to pancreatic and T1 Rnase digestion and could bind to Millipore filter in high salt buffer. We suggest that viral RNA molecules from transformed cells contain poly A sequence.

N2  - The chewing of betel nuts is the widest spread masticatory habit in the world. It has a history of at least 2,000 years, for people have been chewing betel nuts as a masticatory. In the Orient, the number of people having the habit is estimated at over 400 millions. Most of the residents distributed from East coast of Africa along India Ocean to some of the Islands of the Pacific. The components of betel nut quid may be different in different localities, but the essential components, i. e. the betel nuts, gambir or cutch, P. betle, and lime are always the same. In Taiwan the habit of chewing betel nuts very probably came from Malaysia one thousand years ago. The mouth condition of 280 betel nut chewers and 306 non-chewers were examined. The result shows that the average number of teeth of betel nut chewers was 29.45 and the mean value of the caries number was 5.33. The average number of teeth of non-chewers was 29.47, and the mean value of the caries number was 6.06. There is only slight difference between the caries rate of chewers and non-chewers. These differences are not significant and the preventive effects of chewing betel nut on caries is doubtful. Gingivitis and dento-alveolar abscesses in the mouth of betel nut chewers is much commoner than non-chewers. The attrition of teeth, black stained teeth and increasing amounts of calculus are commoner and severer in betel nut chewers.

N2  - Pollen analysis of 19 samples from 4 locationsin in the P'u-li Basin in Nantou Country , ROC. Was carried out during 1972-3. A total of 5,000 fossil palynomorphs were observed and identified. Based on the different pollen assemblages, the pollen diagram has been classified into zones A and B. Zone B is divided into subzones B1, B2 and B3. Zone A, with samples from the surface layer of each site, was characterized by subtropical and temperate elements, such as Pinaceae, Betulaceae, Magnoliaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae, Cyperaceae, Convolvulaceae and Gramineae. Zone B, was found from samples in the deeper layers of the sites. Most components of subzone B1 and B3 were subtropical waste land elements, namely Plantago, Carex, Cyperus, Gramineae, and genera of Convolvulaceae. Pollen assemblages of subzone B2 are the same as those of zone A. Indicator pollen grains for reforestation are those of Cryptomeria, Cunninghamia, and Punus, and for crop cultivation are assemblages of Plantago, Ipomoea, Cyperus, Carex, Gramineae and Chenopodium. According to radiocarbon dating the initial deforestation of the area occurred between 5,000 to 15,900 B.P. before the beginning of zone B. Evidence for cultivation are shown by the appearance of cereal pollen grains and waste land elements from subzone B3 by at least 3,000 B.P. The evidences of pottery and lithic artifacts indicated that the Neolithic peoples of the Lunshanoid culture of southwest Taiwan and southeast China arrived to this area before 2381 B. P.

N2  - 1. Three daylength sensitive rice varieties, Shinriki, Shuang-chiang and Wan-tze were subject to the short day treatment of 9L+15D. During the 15D period, they were placed at the following temperature level: 15°, 20°, 24°, 28°C and 32°C. It was found that all three varieties failed to head at the night temperature of 15°C. The optimum night temperature was 24°C up to 28°C for Shinriki and 28°C for Shuang-chiang and Wan-tze. At temperature lower or higher than the above, heading was delayed. 2. A daylength insensitive variety Norin No.11 with a very short growth period was subject to the following night temperature level: 15°, 20°, 24°, 28°, 32°and 34°C. It was found that low temperatures suppressed floral bud initiation and the growth of floral buds already initiated. However, there was still heading at 15°C. 3.

N2  - The sequence of differentiation and maturation of eight different species of ferns (including both eusporangiate and leptosporangiate) are investigated in this report. With the exception of Botrychium and the giant roots of Angiopteris all other roots are protostelic. The numbers of the protoxylem strands range from two to seven. The larger the root diameter, the more the protoxylem poles occur. The endodermis is characterized by a Casparian strip in the roots of Ceratopteris. Angiopteris and Botrychium or is darkly stained in the roots of Adiantum, Osmunda, Pteris and Marsilea. The relationship between the origin of lateral roots and the stele can be summarized as follow: If the pericycle consists of more than one layer of cells, the lateral root initiates from this tissue, e.g., as in Osmunda and Angiopteris; whereas if the pericycle has only one layer of cells, the lateral root is endodermal in origin, e.g., Adiantum, Ceratopteris Marsilea, and Pteris. In roots having diarch or triarch protoxylem, the lateral roots originate opposite the protoxylem, but lateral roots originate between the xylem and the phloem in roots having tetrarch or heptarch protoxylem. The occurrence of sclerenchyma in the cortex is due to genetic factors rather than physiological ones.

N2  - The root-tips of 14 species belonging to 9 genera and 6 tribes of Liliaceae (Hutchinson, 1959) have been examined in order to observe their somatic chromosomes. A total of 7 taxa are reported here for the first time. The somatic cells of Disporum shimadai have 2n=16, which is reported from Taiwan as a new number. The basic numbers and karyotypes of the genera Aspidistra (X=18) and Campylandra (X=19) are different from each other, and this is correlated with their differences in external features. It is suggested that the genus Campylandra should be excluded from the tribe Aspidistreae. The karyotypes of Aspidistra and Peliosanthes are almost identical. It is possible that these two genera may have been derived from a common ancestor. Possibly a new taxon of Aspidistra has been collected from Mt. Ta-wu, it differs from other species in its karyotype as well as in its external morphology. It needs further study. In the present study, there are found to be only two species of Peliosanthes instead of three in Taiwan, these are P. arisanensis Hay. and P. kaoi Ohwi.

N2  - This study emphasizes the fact that dynamic changes occur in the apical meristem of the primary root in Phaseolus radiatus Linn. During its early stages of development which are associated with germination. The root apical meristem is composed of a group of common initials cells in its early stages. The diameter of these initials average from 24.70 to 31.20 μ in their different developing stages. Twelve hours after germination, it is gradually reorganized into central initials (transverse meristem) and peri-initials. The former gives rise to the stele and columella by transverse division, and latter gives rise to the cortex, epidermis and cap cells other than the columella by various planes of cell division. Slightly before the reorganization of the meristematic region, the root cap cells appear identifiable zonation, i.e., the formation of columella.

N2  - Embryological observations in Amaranthus leucocarpus indicate absence of a distinct endothecium. Small globules occur beneath the tapetal cells. The pollen are shed at the three-celled stage. The ovule is amphitropous, a clear space is present between the two integuments and nucleus. Embryo sac development is of the polygonum type. Antipodals persist till about the 4-celled stage of stage of the endosperm. The radicular apex is established by the late globular stage of the embryo. Shoot apex differentiation commences by the torpedo stage of the embryo.

N2  - Osmotic concentration and pH may inhibit the seed germination and radicle growth of lettuce. At 25 milliosmols, an aqueous solution of Hoagland, sodium chloride, and sucrose exhibits over 50% inhibition on the radicle growth of lettuce. However, mannitol solution reveals 50% inhibition only at concentration above 125 milliosmols. The pH range of from 4 to 8 has only slight significant effect on the radicle growth of lettuce. Interaction between pH and osmotic effects is not evident. Compared with aqueous plant extracts, the nutrient solutions give less inhibition. The results of this study can be use as an indication of a solution of which the cause of inhibition is due to one or both of the aforementioned effects, or due to a phytotoxic effect.

N2  - Cucumbers (Cucumis sativus cv. Pioneer) prefer NO3-N uptake. The different combinations of NH4-N and NO3-N (NH4-N ppm/NO3-N ppm: 75/25, 50/50, 25/75.) did not interfere with NO3-N uptake. However, the existence of NO3-N in a solution with NH4-N did significantly enhance the uptake of NH4-N. The cucumbers grown in NH4-N had fewer leaves, shorter stems, lower fresh and dry weights than those grown at the same level in NO3-N. The cucumbers grown in NO3-N had about the same fresh and dry weights, stem length and leaf number as those grown in the combinations of NH4-N and NO3-N at the same level of nitrogen. The pistillate flower differentiation of cucumbers was not promoted by the nitrogen from ammonium and or from nitrate in the nutrient solutions.

N2  - The origin of the axillary bud primordium in nine species of Calanthe (Orchidaceae) is cauline rather than of leaf origin, though the early stages of the bud is closely related with its associated leaf primordium above it. The first indication of the axillary bud is recognized by a periclinal division occuring in the third layer from the protoderm at the base of the second plastochron or from behind the second plastochron. The shell zone is obvious in the axillary bud at early stages of development.

N2  - In order to answer the question as to when deforestation started and when grasslands became dominant in the Puli Basin, the Waichiataoken profile II was selected as a control site for pollen analysis. After analyzing l0.873 spores, and 19363 pollen grains belonging to 6 families and 12 genera of Gymnosperms, 94 families and 146 genera of Dicotyledons, and 13 families and 18 genera of Monocotyledons, the author came to the conclusion that the select ion of this control site was unfortunate, because the Lauro-Fagaceae forest association has constantly prevailed in this area since the upper Pliocene. The past climate is recognized as having been warm temperate from the upper Pliocene through to the Recent period(?) or Pleistocene? with slight climatic fluctuation during some periods.

N2  - Seasonal activity of cambium has been investigated in Liquidambar formosana Hance, which is a subtropical deciduous tree in Taiwan. Cambial activity is affected mostly by temperature. It is initiated in late March, and as temperature increases it increases in activity until July and then slowly declines and ends in October. Phloem differentiation precedes xylem differentiation by approximately a month. Rainfall and relative humidity possibly have little effect on cambial activity. In view of its relation with phenology, it seems that there is a correlation between actively growing buds and the initiation of cambial activity.

N2  - The cellular changes in EM level occurring in the promeristem of root tip of Phaseolus radiatus Linn, associated with the germination were observed. The obvious changes were the rearrangement and reorganization of cytoplasmic organelles, and the increase in clarity of membrane system in this stage.The following important changes were noted as germination time was prolonged: migration of lipid bodies form the periphery of cell to throughout much of cytoplasm, and a decrease in their number; starch-containing plastids became scarce; the dispersing of the Golgi vesicles from the edge of the dictyosome throughout the cytoplasm; the increase of the irregular or reticulated dictyosome. The possible role of some organelles such as: lipid bodies and plastids in the early stage of germination is also discussed.

N2  - A chromatographic survey, qualitative analysis and quantitative measurements of the carotenoids of the Formosan Salvia were undertaken in order to obtain information which could be used to supplement the data from chromosome, pollen viability, morphology and ecological studies. Conclusions were derived from the chemotaxonomic technique and other approaches. The results agree in all respects with the concepts of the interspecific hybridization (Anderson, 1954) and reticulate evolution relationships or participation theory (Hayata, 1919) found between each entity of Salvia. Several dispositions are suggested, the most striking being the recognition of some populations as being hybrids. Of these, some populations of S. hayatana may have been derived from S. hayatana X arisanensis and S. hayatana X hualiensis, and S. keitaoensis from S. hualiensis X arisanensis. S. japonica might have originated from the hybridization of S. japonica subsp. taipingshanensis with a hayatana-like ancestor. The speciation pathway, by hybridization and chromosome doubling, and the reticulate relationships in Formosan Salvia is established.

N2  - The nitrogen metabolism associated with pollen germination in Crinum asiatica var. sinicum Bak. was studied. A synthetic plant growth stimulant, EDNA (N, N'-dinitroethylenediamide), was added to the culture medium in order to detect whether or not this chemical can effect pollen germination and nitrogen metabolism during pollen germination and pollen tube elongation.In the 180 minute experimental period, the amino acid content in germinating pollen increased about 52% and a remarkable amount of amino acids were released into the culture medium. The protein content of ungerminated pollen contained 18.3% of dry weight, and increased to its maximum quantites in 15 minutes after imbibitions in the culture medium, and then decreased gradually. Using 14C-leucine as a tracer to study protein synthesis, we found about 50% of total newly synthesized protein occurred in the first 30 minutes of the germinating period. The RNA content in germinating pollen increased steadily for 150 minutes germinating period, and then maintained at the same level.EDNA at the 2.5 ppm can stimulate the pollen tube elongation, but when its concentration was 10 ppm or higher in the culture medium, a strong inhibited effect on pollen germination and pollen tube elongation was observed. At this optimal concentration of EDNA (2.5-5 ppm), 14C-leucine incorporation into protein was also stimulated. But beyond this concentration, the higher the concentration of EDNA present in the culture, the stronger was the inhibition effect on protein synthesis. From the 14C-leucine incorporation studies, EDNA did not stimulate the RNA synthesis which may be the important effect of this chemical on pollen germination and pollen tube elongation.

N2  - Tryptophan synthetase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has a different optimum pH value in different buffer systems. In the phosphate buffer system, the optimum pH value was 7.4 and in tris, 7.9. The maximum reaction velocity was higher in phosphate buffer than in tris. The reaction velocity was found to be proportional to incubation time over a period of twenty minutes, and to the protein concentration in a range of 0 to 600 μg per tube. The enzyme can carry on the reaction at a very low concentration of coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate (1X10^(-8) M). The Km for serine was 2.0X10^(-8) M and that for indole was 1.25X10^(-8) M. The concentration of serine (3.7X10^(-2) M) used in experiment had reached the saturation point while that of indole (2.5X10^(-4) M)had not.The enzyme level of tryptophan synthetase was repressed by the addition of tryptophan, indole and anthranilate. At the same concentration (20 μg/ml), indole and anthranilate had a greater repression effect on tryptophan synthetase than tryptophan did.The four analogues used in the experiment, 5-menthyl tryptophan, 6-menthyl tryptophan, indolepropionic acid and indoleacrylic acid, did not have any apparent effect on the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, they showed repression on the enzyme level of tryptophan synthetase when they were added to growth medium.

N2  - The accessory chromosome of Sorghum nitidum appeared to be an iso- chromosome that exhibited considerable inter-arm pairing at pachytene. The centromere misdivision and subsequent structural changes of the nucleolus associated chromosome is postulated as the possible mechanism for the origin of the accessory chromosome in S. nitidum. In microsporocytes, the accessory chromosomes usually divided equally at AI and the members, though often lagging, eventually move to the opposite daughter nuclei. But the accessory chromosomes are often eliminated from the somatic tissues. In the plants with one accessory chromosome, a low frequency of bridges with fragments at AI was observed. This fact indicates that the accessory chromosomes may possible induce the paracentric inversion and crossing over within the inversion loop in the A-chromosomes. The accessory chromosome seems to have a slightly retarding effect on growth vigour.

N2  - Microorganisms in aquatic environments are subject to nutrient starvation, which may influence sensitivity to a wide range of secondary stresses. A Gram-negative polar flagellated rod, isolated from a Colorado mountain stream, and a culture of Escherichia coli were starved in phosphate buffer to determine their responses to transient heating stress (52 C for 5 minutes) and the short-term presence of nutrients (glucose, peptone, acetate) under starvation conditions. These microorganisms had markedly different responses to starvation, secondary stress and nutrient presence. At the beginning of the starvation time, the water isolate was more sensitive to glucose presence, and was extremely sensitive to the secondary warming stress. These responses were markedly diminished after a three-week starvation period. E. coli, under similar condition, responded differently, in that with increasing starvation time it exhibited progressively greater sensitivity to the secondary stress and short-term stress. The differences in sensitivity to secondary stress and short-term nutrient availability showed by E. coli and this indigenous aquatic microorganism may reflect major physiological differences which lead to exclusion of E. coli from aquatic euvironments.

N2  - Patterns of amino acids have been studied in different stages of germination of Phaseolus aconitifolius. A comparison of amino acids of freshly harvested seeds and stored seeds reveals that aspartic acid, glutamic acid, alanine and tyrosine are present in all stages of germination of freshly harvested seeds while aspartic acid is absent in stages I and II of stored seeds but appears in stage III. Arginine is present in stages I and III of fresh and stored seeds and absent in stage IIof both. However in stage III of stored seeds arginine is lacking in plumule. This may be regarded as threshold of viability. Amino acids like proline, leucine and valine are lacking in plumule of both fresh and stored seeds. This would only mean that these amino acids have no role to play in initiation of leaf primordia.

N2  - 5-Fluorotryptophan, a strong inhibitor of Pseudomonas putida at a concentration of 200μg/ml, had an inhibitory effect on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. (PA-1), but even at very high concentration the inhibition was still incomplete. On the other hand, another analogue, 5-fluoroindole, showed complete inhibitory effect on both PA-1 and P. putida at a concentration of 50μg/ml.Tryptophan, the end product of tryptophan biosynthetic pathway, showed a little feedback inhibition on tryptophan synthetase. And the inhibition was less effective on the analogue-resistant mutants: 5-FIR-12 and 5-FTR-1, than on the wild type. 5-Fluoroindole could be substituted for indole as the substrate of tryptophan synthetase. But 5-fluoroindole gave the enzyme a partially competitive inhibition with respect to serine. Whereas 5-fluorotryptophan showed inhibition on both substrates: indole and serine. The inhibitory effect was found to be proportional to the concentration of indole. And this analogue also exhibited a partially competitive inhibition with respect to serine.From the results, the conclusion can be drawn that 5-fluoroindole dose not inhibit PA-1 mainly by its conversion to 5-fluorotryptophan, but rather it may affect the cells directly or by its conversion to other strong inhibitors.

N2  - The spores of nine taxa of Formosan Plagiogyria are studied by scanning electron microscope. They are found to have trilete spores of medium size (30-36 μ×38-65 μ, in polar × equatorial diameters), mostly with rounded or hemispherical processes, and with raised laesurae having thin or thick margos. Based upon sculptine ornamentations five major types of spores can be discerned. A key to the taxa based on playnological data alone is given. Comparison with other species of Plagiogyria found elsewhere are also made. Possible use of spore characteristics in species differentiation and the course of the development of the perispore are discussed. Some outstanding potential of the inherent capacity of scanning electron microscope in playnological studies are point out.

N2  - In order to investigate the vegetatiońal history paleoclimatic change and the activity of early man in Central Taiwan, the Toushe Basin was selected as a site for palynological studyFrom the sediments extending down to 82 m and through 31 m of thickpeat, 40 samples were taken for this study. The palynomorphs were extracted by chemical deflocculation, then permanent slides were prepared by sealing with paraffin. Based on the examination of the permanent slides, a hypothesis for the vegetational history and past climate is proposed as follows:A warm temperate period has prevailed in this area ever since the formation of the lake. Except for scanty pollen zones such as Zone A (8200-7100 cm), Subzone C1 (5900-5300 cm). Subzone C3 (5150-4800 cm) and Subzone C5 (4200-3900 cm). successive series of plant communities have been found as follows: starting at a depth of 71 m, we find that Subzone B1 (7100-6750 cm), has a Quercus-Symplocos-Pasania-Alnus association, Gramineae-Compositae-Typha subassociation; Subzone B2 (6750-5900 cm), Quercus-Pasania-Alnus-Salix-Carpinus association. Gramineae-Cyperaceae subassociation; Subzone C2 (5300-5150 cm), Pasania-Quercus-Myrica-Symplocos association, Gramineae-Cyperaceae subassociation; Subzone C4 (4800-4200 cm), Pasania-Quercus-Myrica-Symplocos-ligustrum-Engelhardtia association, gramineae-Cyperaceae subassociation: Subzone C6 (3900-3100 cm), Pasania-Quercus-Myrica-Symplocos-Ilex-Salix-Engelhardtia association, Gramineae-Cyperaceae subassociation; Subzone D1 (3100-1600 cm), Alnus-Symplocos association, Gramineae-Cyperaceae subassociation; Subzone D2 (1600-1350 cm), Alnus-Symplocos-Ligustrum-Ilex association, Gramineae Compositae subassociation; Subzone D3 (1350-975 cm), Pasania-Quercus-Alnus-Symplocos-Ilex-Salix-Ulmaceae-Mallotus association, Gramineae-Cyperaceae subassociation; and Zone E (975 cm-surface), Liquidambar-Mallotus-Pinus-Ulmus/Zelkova association, Gramineae-Cyperaceae subassociation.From the evidences of charcoal at 670 cm (ca. 3850 years B. P.), and wood fragments with burning traces at 850 cm (ca. 3400 years B. P.) and a steep rise in deposition rate of sediments since 4500 years ago, we suggest that early man may have come into this district to clear the forest as early as 4500 years ago.

N2  - Callus was induced from tobacco pith and subcultured with frequent transfers on Murashige and Skoog modified medium containing 13.5 mg/l IAA and 0.64 mg/l benzyl adenine. The growth curve by measuring the increase of protein content was a typical sigmoid curve for the callus tissue. The total activities of IAA oxidase and peroxidase were not parallel. IAA oxidase activity was low from 8-26 culture-days and increased after 30 days. The activity of peroxidase decreased slightly at an early stage then increased after 12 days which was earlier than of IAA oxidase. Peroxisdae was separated into six isozymes (A, B, E, F, M, N) by disc polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 18 days. A correlation was apparent between the relative levels of the peroxidase isozymes and the rate of growth. The development of slower-migrating peroxidase isozyme A and B was accompanied by a rapid growth rate at the log phase. The isoperoxidases of fast-migrating rate (E, F, M, N) were associated with growth retardation. The zymograph of IAA oxidase after electrophoresis separation was similar to that of peroxidase during the growth period. Peroxidase A, E, F and N possessed IAA oxidase activity, however, isoperoxidase B did not parallel with that of IAA oxidase. Whether these two enzymes were at the same apoenzyme or not was established.

N2  - Dowco 290 (3,6-dichoropicopicolinic acid), a new product of the Dow Chemical Company U.S.A., is a herbicide. The treatment of intact soybean hypocotyl with this herbicide leads to a very marked aberration in the growth pattern. After Dowco 290 treatment, cell divition in the meristematic zone is inhibited; cell elongation ceases in the meristematic and elongation zones, and radial enlargement of cells occur in the elongation and mature zone. This abnormal proliferation of the mature hypocotyl is associated with the increment of nucleolar size (the diameter was 1.5 to 2.5 mμ for untreated and 4 to 6 mμ for treated nucleoi), however there was no significant alteration in size of the nuclei (about 6×8 to 10mμ). The relative DNA, RNA and protein values are about 1:3:11 for the untreated nuclei. The treatment of Dowco 290 on soybean hypocotyls is also associated with an enhancement of chromatin bound RNA polymerase I activity. The nuclei isolated from Dowco 290 treated tissues showed about five times as much RNA polymerase I activity as the nuclei isolated from untreated tissues. But there was no significant difference in the level of RNA polymerase II activity expressed in the nuclei from untreated and treated tissues. RNA polymerase were solubilized from isolated nuclei and then were fractionated on DEAE-cellulose column, the results show that treated and untreated tissues contained nearly equivalent levels of RNA polymerase I than the untreated nuclei.

N2  - Two plant growth regulators, kinetin and 2, 4-D, were tested on soybean plants to find their relative effects on nitrogen fixation. 2, 4-D gave much more severe effects on both morphologically and physiologically than did the kinetin. As a result of the treatments with exogenous kinetin and 2, 4-D, the leaf-area, leaf-number, and the height of the plants was reduced. Leaves showed chlorosis, and the chlorophylls in the leaves (mostly the chlorophyll b) was markedly decreased, the accumulation of the dry matter in the tissue fractions diminished, and other apparent changes involved the shoot-root ratio and the chlorophyll-a to chlorophyll-b ratio. The nitrogen fixing (acetylene reduction) activity of intact plants or of detached nodules was suppressed by kinetin and 2, 4-D. One of the detrimental effects of 2, 4-D or kinetin on nitrogen fixation was a decrease in the root-nodule-number. It is presumed that the nodule-initiation or nodule-degeneration is inhibited or promoted by the stimulation with kinetin or 2, 4-D.

The apical cell exhibits more carbohydrate granules than its neighboring cells in the actively growing root. It is almost missing in the apical cell of the old root. There are marked differences in RNA content between the apical cell and its derivatives in both young and old roots. The division role as well as their physiological roles of the apical cell, based upon the high amount of insoluble carbohydrates in the growing root, compared to the low amount in old root, were discussed.

N2  - Airborne palynomorphs had been investigated in the New Flower Garden City, Taipei suburban one year during 1980 to 1981. A total of 14,044 pollen grains and fern spores were obtained. including 18.54% fern spores. 4.15% gymnospermous pollen grains, and 77.31% angiospermous pollen grins. 95.75% of palynomorphs were identified. They belong to 56 families and more than 100 taxa.The dominant pollen taxa varied seasonally. Pollen grains of Trema orientalis appeared most abundantly in spring; Cyatheaceae spores in summer; Humulus scandens and Miscanthus pollen grains in autumn; and Morus australis and Villebrunea pedunculata in late winter.The local common species and complicate vegetation in this valley were reflected in the assemblage of airborne palynomorphs. Airbone palynomorphs were mostly of short distance dispersion, and their spectra were strongly localized.The effects of meteorological factors on airbone palynomorphs were varied with different taxa. However, in general, the rainfall could decisively decrease the pollen content in the air, but other factors impacted on them as a whole.

N2  - Anthers of rice (Oryza sativa L., 2n=24) heterozygous for the waxy gene (wx+/wx) were cultured on medium supplemented with 2, 4-D and with NAA and kinetin. Histological observation of the anthers thus cultured revealed that only the microspores underwent divisions leading to callus formation; the somatic tissues degenerated or remained quiescent. Upon transfer of callus to the differentiation media, plants with ploidy levels ranging from haploid to tetraploid were regenerated. Staining pollen grains with I2-KI showed that all the diploid and tetraploid plants were homozygous. Furthermore, in both ploidy levels the ratio of waxy to nonwaxy fits the expected 1:1 segregation ratio. Thus histological and genetic evidence indicates that all anther-derived plants obtained in this study are of microspore origin.

N2  - The recent vegetation of Nan Jen Shan has been studied by pollen analysis of surface deposits. Through comparison of present vegetation with pollen spectra, the recent vegetation of Nan Jen Shan was composed chiefly of Fagaceae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, Illiciaceae, Daphniphyllaceae, Magnoliaceae, and Theaceae, almost identical to the present ones. The pollen spectra did not reflect the present dominant species well. Generally speaking, they were under-represented, except most taxa of Fagaceae and Magnoliaceae showed over-represented. The vegetation formula can be expressed with the correction factor method (R-value) as:V=Ca+Cy/2.13+Sy/0.41+Ill/0.04+Da/0.11+Pa/0.23+Li/15.44+Sch/0.81+Ma/2.27+XPe(0.18Ca)+XSc(0.15Ca).Aglaomorpha and Davallia, the epiphytic ferns, were almost disappeared in the present vegetation, but abundantly appeared in the spore spectra, thus a close canopy of recent vegetation could be inferred. Dicranopteris and Diplazium, especially D. donianum, the heliophytic and sciophytic ferns, their percentage in the spore spectra could be used as an indicator of open vs. close, or dry vs. humid vegetation of this area.

N2  - The stratigraphic occurences of 3 classes, 44 form genera, 104 species and varieties of the Miocene fossil Pteridophytic spores from the sediments of the North Taiwan including the Miocene formations on the western flank of the Chuhuangkeng section of Miaoli-hsien, Keelung-Yehliu section and Taipei-Sanhsia section of Taipei-hsien were obtained. Nine new species and three new records were also proposed.The distributional range of these 104 pteridophytic spore taxa in 82 samples have been investigated, then ten useful biostratigraphy events can be recognized. Based on those ten events, the Miocene sediments of Taiwan can be subdivided into nine spore zones. These spore zones have a close correlation with rock units.The fossil sporomorphs which appeared at first time in rock units, decreased its numbers gradually from the oldest to youngest rock formations. From the amount of the Magnastriatites in the different rock units, the habitats of the youngest rock formations of Kueichulin and Nanchuang were dry, and the Kuanyinshan Sandstone was swamp and the older rock formations showed repeatedly alternative swamp and dry conditions.

N2  - A palynological data storage and retrieval system is briefly described. It is currently being applied to 900 records of Formosan pollen grains. First, procedures which were used for encoding the morphological features of a pollen grain are outlined. Next, a storage and retrieval system is discussed, which organizes and updates reference pollen records, catalogs them, and enables retrieval of those stored records which share the same features with an unknown specimen. The whole system has been proved useful and effective. The ways in which the variable characters are treated for the sake of obviating encoding errors are highlighted.

N2  - The development of sporangium and sporogenesis in Isoetes taiwanensis DeVol are described. Based on cell lineage and cytoplasmic contents, the sporangium in I. taiwanensis is suggested to be of hypodermal origin. The ontogeny of microsporangium and megasporangium are the same in the early stage. The first indication of the young microsporangium is the differentiation of the irregular groups of deeply-staining cells (microsporocytes) and lightly-staining cells (which become trabecula, tapetum and part of sporangial wall), whereas the earlist indication as a megasporangium is the enlargement of the megasporocytes. The first fruiting leaves in the growing season are always megasporophylls, and then followed by microsporophylls. There is occasionally some irregularity in the order of succession, and sometimes a sporangium is found bearing both micro and megaspores.

N2  - Thirty-one species of Myxomycetes that appear on the bark of living trees are reported. Nine of them are recorded for the first time on Taiwan: Echinostelium minutum, Calomyxa metallica, Arcyria annulifera, A. carnea, Hemitrichia karstenii, Physarum leucopus, P. serpula, Clastoderma debaryanum, and Macbrideola cornea. Other taxa listed are those included in the genera of: Ceratiomyxa, Cribraria, Reticularia, Arcyria, Perichaena, Physarum, Didymium, and Stemonitis. Their growth habit and microscopic characteristics are demonstrated by figures in eighteen plates. Four apparently undescribed taxa, one of Cribraria and three of Physarum, are described. The taxonomic certainty of them await further comparison and investigation. Boths field collections and moist chamber technique were adopted for the fructifications. All the specimens are deposited in the Mycology Herbarium, Department of Botany, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., TAI.

N2  - The growth, betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, phosphatase and peroxidase of spinach have been measured over a range of salinities. A slight decrease in fresh weight of the shoot was found with increasing salinity above 100mM NaCl; at 300mM NaCl, the fresh weight growth of the root, or the cotyledon was drastically inhabited. Tissue enzyme activities were stydies throughout the experimental range. Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase was restricted to the shoot of spinach, not detected in the root or the cotyledon. Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase increased significantly at 150mM NaCl, and 3-fold increase at 300mM NaCl. However, fresh weight growth, malate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase showed the similar inhibition at a salinity higher than 150mM NaCl. Peroxidase of salinized spinach was stimulated slightly.It was suggested that the increased betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase of salinized spinach may reflect the betaine biosynthetic pathway accelerated somehow by an incremental salt stress.

N2  - Activity and span of nitrogen fixation (acetylene reduction) of rhizobia in the symbiotic rhizobium-callus tissues changed by the carbon sources and concentrations. Hexoses were better than pentoses, and sugars were better than those organic acids, except the fumaric acid, for the rhizobial acetylene reduction in the symbiotic tissues. High concentration of sugar promoted the symbiotic tissues to senescence.No leghemoglobin was found in the symbiotic tissues. The lignification of callus tissues might have a regulatory function to prevent the nitrogenase in rhizobia of callus tissues from oxygen-denaturation.Negligible amount of N2O realeased by symbiotic system. The nitrate respiration might not provide energy to support the rhizobial acetylene reduction in symbiotic callus tissues.

N2  - This is the first report for the pollen analysis of Pliocene in Taiwan. About 6579 palynomorphs are extracted from 19 Pliocene rock samples on the west flank of the Chuhuangkeng oil field along the Houlung River, Miaoli county in northern Taiwan. They can be classified into 57.4% angiospermous pollen grains, 21% gymnospermous pollen grains and 21.6% pteridophytic spores. Four new form species and one new form record are described. Three polen zones for the Pliocene of northern Taiwan are recognized in this study.

N2  - Fifty-seven sample taken from the Yunshuichi section in southwestern Taiwan are palynologically analyzed; six new genera, fifty-two new species, five new records and two new combinations are proposed. The new angiospermous taxa in this study are compared with Muller's review. These new taxa accord with the time course of appearance with several areas outside Taiwan, but Fagraea and Patrinia types have not been sufficiently documented in the past. Some taxa, e.g. Tilia, Pterocarya, Carya, Ephedra, etc., are absent in the present flora of Taiwan, but are still living in southeastern mainland China; therefore the Pliocene vegetation of Taiwan might be, in part, similar to the present vegetation of southeastern mainland China. Two pollen assemblages, i.e., Subalpine-Temperate and Subtropical-Tropical assemblage are utilized to subdivide the pollen zones. Seven pollen zones are determined, the climate became warmer in Zone II; wet and hot in Zone V; cold and dry in Zone VI; prominent temperature changes from warm to cold, then warm to cold again, occurred in Zone VII. Zone VII, therefore, may belong to the early Pleistocene stage. Reworked palynomorphs from Cretaceous and Early Tertiary deposits are commonly found. Based on the appearance of these reworked palynomorphs, including Dinogynium, a widespread marine dinoflagellate in upper Cretaceous, the presence of outcrops of Cretaceous marine deposits in the sedimentary cycle of Yunshuichi section can be inferred.

N2  - An investigation on airborne pollen during 1983 at Nankang, Taipei was undertaken. Pollen grains and fern spores encountered within an area of 3.24 cm2 on a trap slide were counted and identified to genus level. The results show that the highest concentration of airborne pollen grains was found in the spring with a number of tree pollen: Pinus, Juniperus-Cunninghamia, Myrica, Broussonetia, Celtis, Ligustrum, Bischofia, Podocarpus, Casuarina, Trema, Acacia confusa and Mallotus japonicus. Salix and Morus flower at the end of the winter or at the beginning of the spring. In the summer, many fern spores, namely Alsophila, Dicranopteris, Pteridium, Nephrolepis and Lepisorus and some weeds pollen, like Chenopodiaceae were recorded, while in the autumn Mallotus paniculatus, Alnus, Melaleuca and Gramineae were of dominant species. Some weed pollen of Artemisia, Ambrosia and Humulus were also found in the autumn. In the winter the dominant pollen species were Gramineae. A pollon calender showing the occuring pollen and fern spore species during a year is demonstrated.

N2  - Eighty-eight honey samples collected from Middle and South Taiwan between April and May were investigated. Totally, pollen of 53 taxa belonging to 35 families were identified. Both pollen from entomophilous and anemophilous plants were presented in the honey samples. The major honey source plants were presented in the honey samples. The major honey source plants in the spring are Euphoria longana and Litchi chinensis. Pollen of Myrtaceae (Psidium guajava or Syzygium javanicum) is sometimes dominant. Other anemophilous plants, such as Compositae, Ulmaceae (Trema and Celtis), Euphorbiaceae (Macaranga tanarius, Mallotus japonicus and Sapium sebiferum), Moraceae, Gramineae and Polygonaceae (Rumex) are also considerable amount of pollen in the honey. Pollen of Leguminosae (Acacia confusa), Rutaceae (Citrus), etc., also are present frequently. Of the 88 samples, 10 are multifloral honey, 78 are unifloral honey. Amoung the unifloral honeys, 72 are of Longan honey, 2 of Lychee honey, 3 of Psidium honey and one of Compositae honey. The absolute pollen frequency per gram honey was counted.

N2  - The position, topography, and climate of Taiwan are briefly described and shown to be very important for the richness of its pteridophytic flora. The history of botanical exploration of Taiwan is briefly described. It is pointed out that many nomenclatural problems pertaining to Asiatic plants can only be solved by work in European herbaria.The present study is mainly based on the author's field work from 1968 to 1981 both on flora and vegetation, and herbarium studies in Japanese and western European herbaria. 617 taxa were critically examined; they include 4 new species correction. One-third of the names had not been used in Taiwanese botanical literature before.The elevational distribution patterns of Taiwanese pteridophytes agree very well with the vegetation zones in Taiwan. 43% of the Taiwanese pteridophytes belong to the warm-temperate forest zone. Most of the pteridophytes in the coniferous forest zones extend to or are mainly distributed in the Himalayan region. The closest relatives of endemic species in the coniferous forest zones were also studied; they show the same phytogeographical connections.Selective criteria are proposed for comparing floras of neighbouring regions. An analysis of the distribution of selected pteridophytes in the broad-leaved forest zones gave the following results: the pteridophytic flora of Taiwan has very weak relationships with that of Malesia; the pteridophytes of subtropical Taiwan form links with those of the Ryukyus, SE. China, and the lowlands of Indo-China; the pteridophytes of the warm-temperate zone are closely related to those of SW. China (especially Szechwan, Yunnan, Kweichow), N. Indo-China, and NE. India. Thus, Taiwan can be said to have an East Asiatic, rather than a SE. Asiatic-Malesian fern flora, in spite of its position between the two areas.

N2  - Three cell types, tracheid, sieve cell and parenchyma are recognized in the vascular tissue of the corm of Isoetes taiwanensis Devo1. The cambium gives rise to several layers of phloem cells, alternating with several layers of xylem cells. The earliest cambial derivatives are phloem cells. Phloem is composed of sieve cells only with sieve areas uniformly distributed on both radial and transverse walls, whereas xylem consists of mainly the parenchyma and small amount of tracheids scattering among parenchyma. One, occasionally two tubular bridges (termed sieve trabeculae) Iying radially across the cell lumen of sieve cell are recognized.

N2  - The development of the female gametophyte in Isoetes taiwanensis DeVol is described. In the early stage of endosporic gametophyte development, the primary nucleus moves from base to apex and undergoes repeated nuclear divisions to form a free nuclear structure in the apical region. When there are only a few nuclei, the wall formation proceeds around the nuclei both basipetally and centripetally. Karyogenesis and cell wall formation could occur at the same time resulted in binucleate or multinucleate cells. In the full cellular stage, the relatively sharp border between the upper small celled and lower large celled area can be recognized. The lower large cells are rich in food particles. The first archegonial initial arises from a single superficial cell beneath the tri-ridge of the spore wall. The number of archegonia formed in each gametophyte is not constant ranging from 5 to 20. Rhizoids originated also from the superficial cells of the apical region are always on the exposed area after the spore wall breaks. The outgrowth of gametophytic tissue from megaspore wall mainly takes place in December to February indicating it might need cooler weather.

N2  - Airborne pollen grains and fern spores collected at Nankang in 1983 and 1984 were counted and identified. Pollen calendars of both years showing the succession of pollen and fern spore species were prepared and compared. Comparing with 1984, an advance in the pollen season was revealed in 1983. This was probably due to the warmer weather in 1983. Most of the pollen species collected in 1984 were the same as those in 1983, although there were small differences in the quantities present.

N2  - Pittosporaceae is exculsively native to the Old World. There is only one genus, Pittosporum, with five species and a variety in Taiwan, They are found from lowland (P. tobira, P. pentandrum and P. moluccanum), through median (P. illicioides in part) to high altitudes (P. illicioides in part, P. illicioides var. angustifolium and P. daphniphylloides). Except for the cultivated P. pentandrum which will grow into small tree, most species of Formosan Pittosporum, including the wild P. pentandrum are small or large shrubs. They are all mesomorphic but more or less tend to be xeromorphic.Carlquist (1977) introduced vulnerability and mesomorphy ratios to indicate the reflection of vessel elements under various ecological conditions. In Pittosporaceae as a whole, both the vulnerability ratios and mesomorphy ratio of Formosan Pittosporum are low. All alpine species, have low values of the ratio of palisade tissue to intercellular space; only P. daphniphylloides has a thick cuticle. Thus, the low figures of both ratios may reflect adaptation to a form of physiological drought, caused by the winter frost. For the lowland species, the thicker cuticle, the low figures for both ratios, may be an adaptation to the high temperatures, sunny weather and long period of drought in summer.The study of anatomical characters of leaves and stems for Taiwan Pittosporum indicate that plants of the same species vary in anatomical characters when they grow in different environmental conditions, while different species, growing close together or under similar environments, have similar anatomical characters.

N2  - Tobacco protoplast enzymatically isolated from suspension culture were studied. Isolated protoplast showed intact plasma membrane surrounded the outer surface, but sometimes membrane with breb was also observed. Endoplasmic reticulum was abundant and 3 to 10 layers of cisternae in parallel arrangement often occurred. Invaginations of cytoplasmic membrane with some organelles in it were also found. Oil drops prominently occurred in isolated protoplasts with different characters in staining properties and structure. The central and large vacuoles disappeared and small vacuoles tremendously increased in number. Nucleus located in the center of protoplasts with a distinct nucleolus. Annuli on the surface of nuclear envelope were numerous (35/um^2). Plastids were different in shape and size. Structural patterns of plastids are more diverse than that of mitochondria. Stereo pairs showed the three dimensional structures of protoplasts were all identical to that observed in thin sections.

N2  - A data storage and retrieval system has been developed for assembling and manipulating specimen information concerning Taiwanese grass species. It was designed for use on an affordable and widespread microcomputer, and is most suitable for small colleges and universities with small herbaria or for personal collections. Steps involved in the creation of item fields, character sets, file structure, and their updating are briefly described. The query system was so designed that it can be used to retrieve records with desired attributes and from them to give results in a variety of forms, including specimen labels, distribution map, and other relevant information.

N2  - Active cells were harvested from tobacco cell suspension culture. The acid phosphatase of tobacco cells was mostly located in the cell wall and vacuole. Similar zymogram of acid phosphatase revealed in the gradient polyacrylamide gel was observed between the tobacco leaves and their induced-callus. Multiple acid phosphatases of tobacco suspension cells separated by chromatography showed similar substrate specificities to most compounds tested. Zn^(+2) has differential inhibition on the multiple forms of acid phosphatase of tobacco cells.

N2  - The floristic differences found in the secondary forests of the Yenliao area were sampled by the placement of 35 quadrats of 10 × 10 m over a wide range of habitats. The present study was undertaken to (1) use both clustering; and ordinations to elucidate vegetational structure and community relationships; (2) determine the principal factors controlling or closely related with forest composition; (3) evaluate the successional status of the forests.About 221 species were encountered. Vascular species richness per quadrat averaged 50. The Shannon-Wiener diversity measure of the tree stratum averaged 2.56 (natural log) and Simpson's index (complement) avenged 0.92. Dominance is shared by Ardisia sieboldii, Ficus virgata, Cleyera japonica, Ficus fistulosa, Cyclobalanopsis glauca, Srhefflera octophylla, Glochidion rubrum, and Persea thunbergii.Three major community types were defined using minimum variance cluster analysis with basal area and species cover data. The results of reciprocal averaging (RA) and principal component analysis (PCA) indicated a strong response in both quadrat and species characteristics to topographical, moisture, and oceanic complex gradients.Analysis of specie s compositional change across a progression of diameter-based size-strata has been used to reveal the successional relationships which exist between species of tree stratum. It shows a clear trend toward dominance by Brdelia belansae, Persea thunbergii, Ardisia sie boldii and Schefflera octophylla in the near future.Besides, the relative density data for each species' size class were determined, and three population structure patterns were recognized.

N2  - The supplemental observation by EM is made for the phellem of Melaleuca leucadendra L. The EM survey clearly provides the site of ”casparian strip” on the anticlinal wall of short cell. The ”casparian strip” in the young cell is more conspicuous than that in the older cell. The wrinkled wall exhibits only on the anticlinal wall of young short cell. Basing on the absence of plasmodesmata, cytoplasmic contents and the presence of ”casparian strip”, the short cell is suggested as more specialized than the long cell. The cell expansion occurs after the appearance of suberized wall.

N2  - The morphology of the common airborne pollen grains of 57 species were observed with SEM. The most frequently observed pollen can be distinguished by their fine wall structures. However, a few pollen grains like 2- or 3-porate pollen have quite similar morphology and can not be easily identified even under SEM. A more precise identification of airborne pollen was obtained.

N2  - first leaves of 8-day-old, light grown corn seedlings were cut and then were floated in water or 1 × 10^(-5) M N^6-benzyladenine (BA) solution at 28℃ in the dark. Under these conditions, the leaf segments in water showed a significant lose chlorophyll, protein and RNA after 2 days. Treatment with BA delayed the appearance of these symptoms. Protease and RNase activities of segments floated in water were seen to increase. If leaf segments were preincubated with 35S-methionine for five hours under Iight shortly after cut and then transfered to the treatments described above, the segments floated in BA solution had more radioactivity in the protein fraction than the segments floated in water. We concluded that BA can supress the increase of proteolytic activity normally associated with senescence. During senescence the respiration rate of leaf segments increased. Acid phosphatase activity increased strongly during the late stages of senescence of leaf segments. The contents of hemicellulose I, II and cellulose of the cell wall did not decrease significantly.

N2  - The heterocyst formations from the initiation and differentiation of vegetative cells of filamentous Anabaena HA 101 were inhibited by the treatment of ammonium nitrate. Besides, those heterocysts, which had already formed along the filaments, could be hastened to degenerate by the ammonium nitrate. The nitrogen fixing (acetylene reducing) and hydrogen evolving activity of nitrogenase localized in heterocysts were closely related with the level of heterocyst formations and heterocyst degenerations. The nitrogenase activity for hydrogen production was decreased while the Anabaena were incubated with a gas mixture containing dinitrogen, which is the substrate of nitrogenase, but the enzyme activity was increased while the Anabaena were grown under a dinitrogen-limited condition. The oxygen was needed for the energy production for the nitrogen fixation and hydrogen evolution mediated by the nitrogenase. Although the Anabaena were treated with a gas mixture containing 20% oxygen, the nitrogenase in heterocysts remained high activities for nitrogen fixation and hydrogen production. The inhibitor, KCN, but not DCMU, suppressed the nitrogenase to reduce acetylene and to evolve hydrogen. This suggests that the energy required for nitrogenase activities was derived from oxidative phosphorylation of respiratory process but was not from the photophosphorylation of photosynthetic process.

N2  - Cuscuta (dodder) are parasitic plants that attack many commercial crops and orchards. There are two species in Taiwan; i. e., C. australis R. Brown and C. Japonica Choisy var. formosana (Hay.) Yunker. In this report we present the work on the host plants and the haustorium of the latter species. Field studies indicate that at least 36 host plants are attacked by this dodder including fruit trees, naturally occurring woody species, many herbaceous annual and perennial plants. The spiral growth of this dodder uniformly shows the directions to right, counterclockwise. Two types of hyphae including intercellular and intracellular type are found which variable with host plants. The penetration of the tip of the haustorium is also under the influence of internal structure of the host. The presence of prehaustorium, brush like structure and granulated cells in the tip or haustorium are a general feature or this dodder.

N2  - In Taiwan, Fagus hayatae Palib. ex Hayata (Taiwan beech) is of particular interest because of its limited and relic-like distribution within the Lalashan Nature Reserve in northern Taiwan. It forms nearly pure stands extending about 18 km along the ridges at elevations of 1,300 to 2,000m. Three stands, representing northern, middle, and southern ranges of the beech forests, were sampled using thirty-two 10 x 10 m quadrats. They were surveyed for physiognomy, structure and floristic composition. About 172 species of vascular plants were encountered. Species richness per plot averaged 39. Diversity of trees with a DBH ＞ 1.0cm was calculated as Shannon-Wiener index (2.34) and Simpson index (0.12). The density was 5700 stems with an average basal area of 56 m^2 per ha. The beech contributed more than 76% of the total basal area. Other important species were Rhododendron formosana and Enkianthus purulatus in the subcanopy layer. In the understory, Yushanian niitakayamensis (dwarf bamboo) usually formed extremely dense layers. Sum of square agglomerative cluster analysis led to the recognition of 3 vegetation types. Reciprocal averaging ordination of the plots suggested a vegetational continuum in response to topographic gradient. Size-class distribution of the beech indicated a unimodal pattern with underrepresentation exhibited in the smallest size-class; however, variation among sampling locations might be present. It also suggested that Taiwan beech was likely to be shade-intolerant. In terms of physiognomy and generic composition, closest affinity appeared to be with the Fagus lurida forest of Mt. Fangchingshan in southeastern China.

N2  - Development of the microsporangium, and the male gametophyte were studied in Diospyros chloroxylon Roxb. and D. virgiana L. The anther wall development is of the Dicotyledonous type and at maturity it consists of the epidermis, fibrous endothecium, 2-3 wall layers and a secretory tapetum which is uniseriate with uni- or binucleate cells. Connective tapetum is also differentiated. Pollen mother cells divide simultaneously and produce tetrahedral tetrads. Cytokinesis is by furrowing. Pollen grains are smooth, tricolporate and two celled at the time of liberation. Rarely 3-nucleate pollen grains are seen. Pollen degenerations are common in D. virginiana.

N2  - Twenty-four species of subgenus Bladhia (Thunb.) Mez and two species of subgenus Chinensia (Nakai) Yang of Ardisia (Myrsinaceae) are recognized in this treatment. Subgenus Bladhia is redefined as the shrubby or subshrubby plants having axillary inflorescences from hypsophylls only or from both leaves and hypsophylls, 4-15 ovules in 1-3 series (mostly 4-6 ovules in one series) on the free central placenta, serrate or serrulate or fimbriate-serrulate leaves subverticillately arranged, hypsophylls on stems, and uniseriate and/or round-capitate and/or elongate-bicellular-capitate hairs on young stems, leaves, and inflorescences. On account of the position of inflorescences, this subgenus is possibly related to subgenus Tinus of Ardisia. However, the question concerning its allied subgenus is still open.Subgenus Chinensia consisting of 2 species is delimited by having axillary inflorescences only from the leaves, 5-8 ovules in 1-2 series, leaves alternately arranged, coarsely dentate or undulate or entire, no hypsophylls, scales irregularly peltate on young stems, etc. Subgenus Akosmos is closely related to subgenus Chinensia as is evidenced by the similarity in inflorescences, calyx-lobes, series of ovules, leaf venation, and trichomes.Geographically, subgenus Bladhia extends from Assam, northeast of India, to the Malay Peninsula, Java, Borneo, Indochina, the Philippines South and East Mainland China, Taiwan, the Ryukyus, Japan, and Korea. Subgenus Chinensia is sporadically distributed in the Malay Peninsula, Indochina, and mostly distributed in South and East Mainland China, Taiwan, and the Ryukyus.This study gives a taxonomic history of the subgenus concerned and a systematic treatment of vegetative and reproductive structures as well as foliar venation.

N2  - Badhamia gracilis is reported for the first time from Taiwan. Morphological characteristics were examined with the aid of LM and SEM. Spores possess spines with the wall surface divided by ridges into large reticula.Spore germinated by splitting, with two protoplasts issuing from smaller spores and four from larger ones. Cream-colored plasmodia were then found in single swarm cell cultures. This collection is therefore non-heterothallic. Fruiting bodies thus formed produced viable spores resembling those from field collections. A description of the species based on the Taiwan collection is also provided.

N2  - One strain of bacteria parasite-Bdellovibrio was isolated from cuItured fish ponds in Taiwan. This strain is able to parasitize on Aeromonas hydrophila, designated as Bdellovibrio A-1. The morphology of host and parasite were examined by means of electron microscopy. The effect of medium composition, initial pH of medium, incubation temperature, addition of divalent cation and kinds and concentration of host bacteria on the growth of Bdellovibrio were investigated. The optimum temperature for the growth of Bdellovibrio in liquid medium was 25-29℃. The optimum initial pH of medium was pH 6.5. Growth of the parasite was dependent upon the addition of Ca^2+ and Mg^2+. The highest lytic action of Bdellovibrio was obtained by using a higher concentration or fish pathogenic bacteria(4x 10^8 cells/ml) as host.

N2  - Twelve specimens of Ganoderma, subgen. Elfvingia (Karst.) Imazeki were collected from hardwoods at several locations in Taiwan, and pure cultures were isolated. Based on morphology of the basidiocarps, all specimens were identified as Ganoderma australe (Fr.) Pat. Monokaryotic cultures were obtained from basidiospores of artificially cultivated fruit-bodies of the isolate TAI-01. The mating system was determined as heterothallic and tetrapolar. Using cultural studies and compatibility by dikaryon-monokaryon mating reactions, these isolates could be separated into two groups. Isolates of Group 1 (including 7 isolates) had an average growth rate of 6.2 mm/day at its optimum temperature range of 28-32℃. The di-mon matings were incompatible. It is concluded that there are two ”intersterility groups” of G. austral in Taiwan.Four monokaryotic isolates representing the mating types from Taiwanese collection of G. australe TAI-01 were mated with five isolates under the name of G. applanatum (Pers.) Pat. (=G, lipsiense (Batsch) Atk.) obtained from ATCC or CBS. ATCC 32585, isolated from a tropical hardwood in India, was compatible with monokaryotic isolate TAI-01, and had a similar growth temperature requirement than Group 1 of G. australe from Taiwan. The other four isolates of G, lipsiense, ATCC 32586, CBS 175.30, 187.31, 250.61, were incompatible with G. australe TAI-01. ATCC 32585 of G. lipsiense is, thus, probably identical to G. australe.

N2  - Both Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn, and Nymphaea tetragona Georgi contain crystals in their leaves, but the crystals differ in shape, size and distribution. In Nelumbo the crystals, with a druses form, occur in the central vacuole of crystal idioblast. Generally, there is only a single druse per cell. As the crystal idioblasts mature, the cell wall partly collapses around the crystal and the sharp points or facets of the crystal protrude into the adjacent air space. In Nymphaeo, the crystal has a prismatic form. It was observed in the extraplasmic space between the primary and secondary cell wall or the sclereids. As the sclereids grow, the sharp facets or the crystal become protruded but remain covered by primary wall material. The crystal idioblasts in these two aquatic plants are round associated with aerenchyma. Their formation is suggested to linked with evaporation of water. The crystals in both Nelumbo and Nymphaea were identified as calcium oxalate by means of X-ray micro-analysis and acid-etching tests.

N2  - Floristic composition and structure of a lowland secondary forest was studied in detail on Mt. Lonlon of northeastern Taiwan. The study plot contained 241 species, of which 70 were trees, 39 shrubs, 48 climbers, 45 herbs, and 39 pteridophytes. Diversity of the trees with dbh ≥1.0 cm was calculated as Shannon-Weiner index (3.09), Simpson index (0.08), and Equitability index (0.79). The dominance-diversity curve seemed to conform to a lognormal species distribution. The community structure was characterized by a relative dominance of Myrsine sequinii, Ardisia sieboldii, Persea thunbergii, Wendlandia formosana, Gardenia jasminoides, and Schefflera octophylla in the canopy, and Psychotria rubra and Lasianthus plagiophyllus in the understory. Detrended correspondence analysis and cluster analysis led to the recognition of three ecologically meaningful groupins. Diameter distribution curves for vegetation types were observed to fit the negative exponential function. However, slight under-representation in the smallest size-class of the upper slope vegetation might be indicative of some minor anthropogenic disturbances. Compared to the mature low land rain forests of other areas the Lonlon forest showed a lower basal area, and seemed to be indicative of structural immaturity.

N2  - By the TEM method, on the partially degraded wall of the microspores of Selaginella bellula Moore, the basic biopolymer units in angstrom dimension were observed. These results are the first on Pteridophyta spores in this field. Using the modified Markham rotation method in the outmost layer of the wall (perispore) a hexagonal, in the exospore a regular pentagonal polygon biopolymer unit was established. On the basis of the recently elaborated methods of the biopolymer of the biopolymer organization of the sporoderm the hexagonal biopolymer organization may be modeled with the TICOS polyhedra. The effect of high temperature was investigated to the qualitative and quantitative morphological characteristic features of micro- and megaspores. In comparison to previous results on gymnosperm and angiosperm pollen grains, the alterations of the spores of the genus Selaginella are not so striking.

N2  - The anatomy and ontogeny of ligule in Selaginella delicatula (Desv.) Alston were examined using both optical and electron microscopes. The ligule varies in form, from finger-like, bi- to multilobed palmate, acropetally as four regions basing on the cell morphology. They are sheath glossopodium, basal cell region and neck. The Sheath cells as well as the glossopodium cells are transfer cell in the well developed ligule. The former is flattened double cell layered the latter is single row of elongated and highly vacuolated cells. Basal cell region is composed of relatively isodiametric protoplasmic cells whereas the cells in neck are overlapped each other in arrangement. The first indication of the senescence of a ligule is the shrinkage of neck cells. The possible function of each region of the ligule is assumed based on cellular structure.The ligule arises from two to three rows of adaxial protodermal cells at the junction of leaf primodium and stem. As it grows, the basal cells are the first tissue to be identified, followed by glossopodial cells, sheath cells and neck cells.

N2  - Previous studies indicated that a 57 kDa polysome-associated-protein (p57) accumulated in cytoplasmic polysomes when W64A maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings were inoculated with Bipolaris maydis, heat shocked, or treated with the herbicide paraquat. Efforts were made to determine the binding of this protein to ribosomes, and to study whether this protein was synthesized de novo or mobilized from another cellular structure in leaf tissues responding to stress. Pulse-labeling of inoculated seedlings with H^3-leucine and treatments of seedings with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, indicated that p57 existed in cells before inoculation. Chloroplastic polysomes isolated from both inoculated and control leaves contained this protein. Presumably, p57 redistributed from chloroplasts to cytoplasmic polysomes and bound specifically to the 40S ribosomal subunit to inhibit translation in response to biotic and environmental stresses.

N2  - Bulliform cells of Arundo formosana Hack. occur intercostally in adaxidal epidermis of leaf blade. They are the most vaculoated among all cell types in epidermis. They contain very few organelles. Bulliform cell initiates in protoderm that is located in the sinus between two procambia. The site and initiation sequence of bulliform cells are closely related with the formation of procabium. The later enlargement of bulliform cell occurs synchronously, and is limited by the presence of subepidermal sclerenchyma neighboring it. The enlargement of bulliform cells would play an important role in expansion of the developing blade.

N2  - Acid phosphatase in different tissues of rice (Oryza sativa) was studied with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and enzyme assay. The zymogram of acid phosphatase showed different isozyme patterns in roots, leaves, seedlings and calli. One of the medium mobility isozymes, cell-wall-containing enzyme, commonly occurred in all tissues. Some isozymes had tissue-specificity. The optimal pH of acid phosphatase was around 5. Enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by HgCl2, (NH4)4Mo7O24, NaF, CuSO4 and KH2PO4. In germinating seeds, the increasing activity of acid phosphatase related with transportation of phosphates and store food had been suggested.

N2  - The PRIS is an integrated software system designed to facilitate vegetation survey and resource inventories. The concept behind this system was to develop a tool that could provide information about species and vegetation to conservation agencies, scientific researchers, land-use planners, and resource managers. Sources of information included in the PRIS can be: (1) museum or herbarium collections; (2) extensive searches through scientific and publications pertaining to taxonomy, phytogeography, ecology, biology, and uses of plants; and (3) data from field survey.PRIS takes the advantage of the affordable and widespread personal computer. It requires a 286 or 386 computer with an image system. The software is organized into two subsystems. PRIS I is used for vegetation analysis. Capabilities include: raw data manipulation, plant list preparation, resemblance measurement, dominance and composition analyses, calculation of species diversity, ordination, clustering, regression, population structure analysis, and preparation of species distribution.The second subsystem PRIS II is designed to synthesize information on the status of a species or other taxon. It integrates information regarding herbarium collections, taxonomic classification, biological characteristics, habitat and environment, economic value, legal status, and degree of threat or protection for the various populations. The subsystem also incorporates graphics and image functions, and makes it more versatile and powerful.

N2  - Nearly half species in the family Gramineae in Taiwan were examined anatomically. The Kranz syndrome based on leaf blade anatomy is characterized by the presence of Kranz sheath, the few number of maximum cells count and short interveinal distance. A preliminary checklist of C3 and C4 grasses in Taiwan was presented and determined by the non-Kranz or Kranz syndrome. Of 109 species out of 150 species, were recognized as C4 and the others were assigned as C3. Some aspects of the above criteria in related to each subfamily were also described and discussed.

N2  - The spermatogenesis in Selaginella tamariscina (Beauv.) Spring is studied from the mature microspore to the spermatid. The persistent prothallial cell produced by the first division of the mature microspore situates at the distal pole. The plane of the first division of the antheridial initial is parallel to the equator of the microspore in the majority of specimens. The spermatid is characterized by containing a pair of parallelly oriented centrioles and multilayered structure which is composed of four layers.

N2  - The metamorphosis of spermatozoid and the formation of operculum in microgametophyte of Selaginella tamariscina (Beauv.) Spring are studied under EM. The distinct events during the metamorphosis are: (1) the elongation of the apical mitochondrion, (2) the separation of basal bodies and emergence of flagella, (3) the elongation of nucleus and (4) discard of excess cytoplasm.The formation and opening process of operculum described are the significant finding of microgametophyte in heterosporous lycopods. Operculum is derived from several jacket cells. After the operculum takes off, the spermatozoids spring out in a clump. Occasionally the jacket cells give rise to the spermatids, too.A mature spermatozoid has a twisted long nucleus, an apical mitochondrion with or without a posterior mitochondrion, a posterior plastid containing several large starch grains and two flagella. The anterior flagellum exserts from the apex of the apical mitochondrion, while the posterior one exserts from the juncture of the apical mitochondrion and the nucleus.

N2  - To learn about genotypic variations in allelopathic potential, 24 strains of a wild rice, Oryza perennis Moench, collected from tropical Asian and American countries, and two rice cultivars (O. sativa L.), were planted at Nankang, and water extracts from their leaves and stems taken at the booting stage were used for bioassay with Chinese cabbage and rice seeds. The extracts were also used for chromatographic analysis to determine the contents of nine phenolic acids. The strains tested markedly differed in root-growth suppression rates in bioassay and contents of phenolic acids, but the two kinds of measurements were largely uncorrelated. The root-growth suppression rate in Chinese cabbage was considered as representing the allelopathic potential better than that in rice. Stepwise regression analysis showed that a combination of several phenolic acids and their interactions could account for the root- growth suppression rate in Chinese cabbage. The result of bioassay clearly indicates the main direction of differentiation in O. perennis strains.

N2  - The potential use of chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) induction assay as a tool for screening and characterizing the tolerance of ozone (O3), contrasting cultivars of snapbeans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), was investigated. A range of CF parameters was examined for snapbeans treated with O3. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters such as Fo, Fmax, and Fv, Fv/Fmax were compared in O3 tolerant and susceptible snapbeans cultivars grown under O3 stress conditions. O3-stressed leaves showed significantly higher constant-yield (Fo) but greatly reduced variable fluorescence (Fv) and decreased Fv/Fmax ratios. In the O3-sensitive cultivar snapbean cv BBL-290, O3 stress resulted in a strong inhibition of the fast and slow fluorescence-induction transients and altered the form of the kinetic curves of CF in leaves. In particular, the fluorescence quenching rate and Fv/Fmax ratios were markedly decreased in O3-stressed leaves. In contrast, leaves of the O3-resistant cultivar cv Astro showed only minor changes in CF. The values of the Fv/Fmax ratio decreased in the O3-sensitive cultivar much more drastically than the O3-resistant cultivar. Based on CF measurements, it appears that O3-induced stress blocked photosynthetic electron transport between photosystem (PS) II and PS I. The close agreement between changes in fluorescence and visual symptoms of O3-induced injury suggest that the CF patterns, the rate of fluorescence-induction transients, and the Fv/Fmax ratio can provide valuable tools to investigate the photosynthetic and metabolic mechanisms affects by O3-induced stress. Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis could also be a useful technique which could be used by plant breeders to screen large numbers of plant reapidly for air pollution sensitivity.

N2  - Numerous thin, adventitious aerial roots develop on the stems of Ficus microcarpa L.f.. They bear root caps, but lack root hairs. In this paper, the tips of aerial roots of Ficus microparpa were investigated by means of light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. In the median longitudinal section, the culumella consists of 8-15 layers of living parenchyma cells derived from the calyprogen. The peripherial cells of the root cap are callapsed and sloughed off. The cells of calyprogen have a large nucleus with a pronounced nucleolus and many small vacuoles. The plastids are pro-plastids. When the cells of the cap leave the initial zone, the alteration in the ultrastructure of plastids including the build-up and the break down of starch grains, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum can be recognized. The culumella cells (statocytes) of aerial root cap in Ficus microcarpa show no strict ultrastructural polarity.

N2  - Mungbean (Vigna radiate L.), a chilling sensitive plant species, was used in this study. Seeds were germinated at 28°C in the dark for 32 h before cold treatment. The seedlings were chilled at 4°C for various durations. Growth, respiration rate, protein synthetic activity, cellular leakages and succinate dehydrogenase activity in isolated mitochondria were then determined.Chilling at 4°C suppressed seedling growth, increased solute leakages, suppressed succinate dehydrogenase activity in isolated mitochondria, inhibited general protein synthesis and induced the synthesis of a set of proteins termed chilling-induced proteins. The molecular weights of these chilling-induced proteins were 110, 88, 78, 69, 58, 48, 38, 27, 22, 19, 14, 12.5 and 10.5Kd, respectively and the proteins with molecular weights of 88, 69, 58, 48, 38, 14, 12.5 and 10.5 Kd were the major chilling-induced proteins of mungbean seedlings. These chilling-induced proteins were different from the heat shock proteins of mungbean seedlings.

N2  - The characteristic periodical changes in the species and communities of phytoplankton in a pond situated in northern Taiwan were studied for three years, from July 1986 to June 1989. the physicochemical factors as well as the amount of zooplankton were taken into account to elucidate the relation of them to the variations in phytoplankton density during the study time is not due to the decline in grazing pressure. The maximum of phytoplankton densities in the pond was developed toward summer. Nevertheless, seasonal succession in phytoplankton communities was not evident. The results from the analysis of water quality and from the indicator species of phytoplankton indicate that this pond was in hypereutrophic state and of the level between beta- and alpha-mesosaprobity. High nutrient concentration in the pond and mild temperature in winter were regarded to be the main reason resulting in the irregularity of the periodical changes in phytoplankton assemblages.

N2  - Anthers are tetrasporangiate. Anther wall develops in a monocotyledonous manner, leading to the formation of three layers below the epidermis. Anther tapetum is of Glandular type and its cells become two-nucleate. Microspore mother cells are arranged in two rows and normal meiosis leads to the formation of isobilateral microspore tetrads. Cytokinesis is of the successive type. Pollen grain is 1-porate and 3-celled at the time of shedding. Some abnormal pollen grains with three to four sperms have been observed. The ovary contains a single bitegmic, hemianatropous and tenuinucellate ovule. Meiosis in megaspore mother cell leads to the formation of T- shaped tetrad of megaspores. The chalazal megaspore is functional and embryo sac development follows monosporic Polygonum type. Embryo sac after fertilization shows prominent caecum towards the chalazal end. Antipodal cells get displaced to this lateral caecum. Endosperm development is of the nuclear type and embryogeny follows Asterad type.

TAIS is a versatile and changing system used for recording and manipulating information about herbarium specimens. It was designed for run on microcomputers, and will eventually allow encoding of the 220,000 specimens housed at the TAI. The system consists of a main SPECIMEN base and two accessory bases containing species names and geographic maps. The incorporation of map images into application made it more powerful. Three different ways of localizing collection sites is described. Grid references and latitude/longitude can be generated automatically. Outputs of the system include specimen label, specimen citation, distribution map, and user defined information.

N2  - Responses of cultured anthers to ginseng and plant hormones on browning and callus induction, and responses of microspore-derived calli to ginseng and ginsenosides, Rg1 and Rb1, on organ formation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) were studied. Results obtained from these studies indicated that anther browning was attributed to plant hormones and that ginseng had little effort on it. Kinetin and α-naphthaleneacetic acid were important factors for the induction of microspores to form calli in the cultured anthers while ginseng had no effort on callus induction at the concentrations tested. Ginsenosides Rg1 and Rb1 promoted organ formation in calli derived from microspores. Rg1 was more effective than Rb1 in promoting plantlet regeneration while Rb1 was effective in promoting root formation, indicating that their mode of actions in regulating organ differentiation may be somewhat different.

N2  - Mesophyll protoplasts of Nicouana plwnbaginifoJia (PP) and N. sylvestris (SS) were mixed at equal density, treated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and then cultured in medium with no selection pressure against parental cells. Cytological, morphological, and biochemical studies showed that about 78%of plants regenerated from protoplast fusion were somatic hybrids. The ploidy levels of somatic hybrids varied, and the frequencies of plants with PPSS, PPPPSS, and PPPPSSSS genome constitutions were 84.8%, 8.7%, and 6.5%, respectively. Aneuploid numbers and chromosome structural changes were common in somatic hybrids. The- successful recovery of somatic hybrids in the absence of artificial selection is attributed to a high viability of the fusion products following PEG treatment and a fast rate of growth and development of hybrid cells during in vitro culture.

N2  - Superoxide dismutase (SOD: EC 1.15.1.1) from different plant parts of Arabidopsis and paraquat-treated leaves were characterized using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Five different forms of SOD were identified by their sensitivity to cyanide and hydrogen peroxide. The molecular weight of Mn-SOD, Fe-SOD and CuZn-SODs was estimated to be 80KD, 50KD, 35KD, 25KD, 20KD and 15KD, respectively. A similar pattern of Mn-, Fe- and CuZn-SOD was observed in all plant parts. The pIs of the SODs were determined to be 3.8, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.35 by isoelectric focusing. CuZn-SODs contributed the major activity of total SOD. Only the CuZn-SOdIII activity showed an apparent increase following the Arabidopsis plants treated with paraquat.

N2  - Acid phosphatase (EC 3. 1. 3. 2.) extracted from rice seedlings consisted of ten kinds of isozymes based on separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One isozyme was purified through ammonium sulfate precipitation, Ultrogel gel filtration, DEAE-trisacryl chromatography and chromatofocusing. This enzyme had a high affinity to p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The molecular weight of this isozyme was around 130kD examined with FPLC and it consisted of heterodimer with molecular weight of 70kD and 62kD. The purified isozyme had a pH optimum at 5.0 and its Km (p-nitrophenyl phosphate) was 0.69 mM. Mg^(++) and Mn^(++) enhanced the activity, but heave metal ions were inhibitory. NaF and Na2MoO4 also had an inhibitory effect on the isozyme.

N2  - The mature embryo sac of Arundo formosana Hack. contains an egg apparatus composed of an egg cell and two synergid cells at the micropylar end, a central cell with two large polar nuclei in the middle, and a mass of 8 to 18 antipodal cells at the chalazal end. The egg apparatus shares a cell wall with the central cell at the micropylar end and there is only a plasma membrane surrounding at the chalazal end. The cytoplasm of the egg is rich in mitochondria, starch-containing plastids and oil drops. Two synergid cells are very similar and strong polarized; mitochondria are distributed at the micropylar end and surrounding the filiform apparatus; plastids are only distributed at the chalazal end; and dictyosomes and dilated ER vescicles are numerous. The central cell has a complex organized cytoplasm that is rich in organelles; the two polar nuclei are partially fused; and many ingrowth walls occur adjacent to the nucellus. The antipodal cells contain a large amount of ER and ribosome. Plasmodesmata are present in the cell wall between the embryo sac cells, but not adjacent to the nucellus. After pollination, the egg shows a considerable increase in polarity. The persistent synergid cell retains its original constitution and the degenerated synergid cell is filled with the electron dense materials. The number of dictyosomes and the quantities of oil drops and starch increase in the central cell. In the antipodal cells, most of the rough ER becomes parallel with the cell walls; some dense-staining particles may be present between the plasma membranes and the cell walls; and the ingrowth walls occur adjacent to the nucellus.

N2  - The sclereids of Nymphaea tetragona Georgi originate sporadicaIly from the fundamental parenchyma. They undergo the following developmental phases: (1) phase of hypertrophic growth and ramification; (2) phase of crystal formation; and (3) phase of sclerification. The distinguishable features of sclereid initials are their large nucleus, dense cytoplasm with abundant organelles and the conspicuous branching of the cells. The formation of calcium oxalate crystals in the cell wall of developing sclereid generally occurs after its shape is attained. Between the plasmalemma and the primary cell wall many crystal chambers are formed, which are bounded by crystal sheath. Mitochondria, dictyosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum often occur in close association with the plasmalemma surrounding the crystal chambers. At maturity, the sclereids possess extremely thick walls and the crystals are embedded between the primary and secondary wall. In plant cells the calcium oxalate crystals are generally located in the central vacuoles.

N2  - The upper epidermal layers of soybean seeds and germinating were studied at different time intervals with light microscope and transmission and scanning electron microscopes. There was no stoma on the upper epidermis of mature soybean seeds before seed germination. Instead, guard-cell mother cells were present among other epidermal cells. Each guard-cell mother cell forms two connected guard cells within 24 h and the stomatal pores appear at about 72 h after planting. The ultra-structural changes of the guard-cell mother cells were studied during the early germination period at 24 h interval for 3 days. The stored food particles including starch grain, lipid droplets and protein bodies in the cytoplasm of the guard-cell mother cells and guardcells were studied histochemically.

N2  - Fresh pollen grains of Alnus glutinosa were radiated with the same intensity of CuKα ray for four different lengths of time. The alterations in the exine ultrastructure and particularly in the biopolymer organization were investigated. The most important results are as follows: (1) The originally homogeneous substance of the ectexine layers are altered into finely granular one. (2) In particular on the surface, the degradation of the biopolymer system have been observed with several kinds of organization. (3) The original ultrastructural characteristic features of some exinous layers (e. g. lamellar endexine) disappear. (4) Endexine and the protoplasm may have the same secondary ultrastructure. (5) Peculiar effect to the bordering part of the different exinous layers have been observed with strong electron density. From these results it is concluded that X-ray has effected a heterogeneous character.

N2  - The polarity in the zygote of Arundo formosana Hack. differs from that in the egg. This report mainly describes the changes and shift of the cytoplasmic contents in the zygote of Arundo formosana Hack. as observed by both light and electron microscopies. The nuclear fusion in zygote occurs earlier than that in the primary endosperm. The nucleus of the zygote is centrally located and the majority of cytoplasmic organelles become aggregated on one side of the nucleus at the end of nuclear fusion. The new cytoplasmic organelles are formed in great quantities at the micropylar half of the zygote. Mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes increase more rapidly than other organelles. As the development take place, most organelles as well as nucleus move towards the chalazal pore resulting in the change of polarity in zygote. When the endosperm undergoes nuclear division, electron dense wall materials deposite between the zygote and young endosperm. Wall formation progress from the micropylar pole to the chalazal pole discontinuously. The wall formation completes before the first division of the zygote. The first division in zygote is transverse forming a large basal cell and a small terminal cell. Vacuoles are distributed at the micropylar half of the basal cell and seldom present in the terminal cell. The basal cell contains more dictyosomes and oil drops, whereas the terminal cell contains denser cytoplasm. The cytoplasm of the two-celled proembryo is rich in organelles which are uniformly distributed. Plasmodesmata are found between two cells of proembryo, but not in the walls associated with the two-celled proembryo and developing endosperm.

N2  - Embryology of Aristida funiculata, A. hystrix, A. mutabilis and A. setacea has been studied. The anthers are tetrasporangiate. The anther wall comprises of an epidermis, endothecium, middle layer and tapetum. The anther tapetum is of the Glandular type and its cells become 2-to 4-nucleate. Endothecium develops fibrous thickenings when the pollen grains are at 2-celled stage. Meiosis is normal and successive cytokinesis leads to the formation of isobilateral microspore tetrads. Pollen grains are monoporate and 3-celled at the time of shedding. Supernumerary nuclei have been observed in pollen grains of A. hystrix. The ovule is hemianatropous, bitegmic and pseudocrassinucellate. However in A. funiculate and A. setacea ovules are tenuinucellate. Meiosis in megaspore mother cell leads to the formation of either 'T'-shaped or linear tetrad of megaspores. The chalazal megaspore of the tetrad is functional and develops into Monosporic Polygonum type of embryo sac. The number of antipodals varies from 3 to 13. Endosperm development is of the Nuclear type and the embryo development conforms to the Asterad type.

N2  - Fruiting bodies of three physaraceous Myxomycetes were found among others abundantly growing on a pile of decaying fallen leaves in spring and summer, 1993 at a corner of NTU campus. They all are plasmodiocarpous in form, have distinctly double peridium, smooth outer surface of outer peridium, and dense capillilium consisting of large rounded lime nodes and short hyaline threads. Yet they can be separated from each other by the colour of outer peridium and spore makings. Physarum aeneum R.E Fries and P. bogoriense Racib. are similar in spores but easily recognized by the colour of outer peridium. Physarum aeneum has beige to bronze outer peridium, while P. bogoriense is paler, browbish grey. P. echinosporum A. Lister is distinct by the white, eggshell-like outer peridium and the longly echinulate spores. In this paper, the plasmodium of P. echinosporum, white in color, is reported for the first time. All of the above three species of palsmodiocarpous Physarum are new to Taiwan. Specimens collected are deposited in the Mycology Herbarium of the Botany Department, NTU, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.

N2  - The initiation and developmental features of floral organs of 〞Cuscuta australis〞 R. Br. were examined with the scanning electron and light microscopy. The sequence of initiation of the floral organs in a flower bud is that of sepals, stamens, petals and gynoecium. The first sepal is initiated laterally; the remaining four sepals are initiated in helical succession. The five petals are initiated alternating with the sepals. The five stamens are initiated slightly early, and alternating with the petals. The five scales arise at the base of stamen, when two stigma are visible. Two opposite carpels arise with four ovules and fuse toward apex gradually, after all other floral organs are initiated. The five sepals mature first, curve at the tips and enclose the other organs. The five petals are delayed in develop, and elongated later after tetralobed anthers are visible in stamen. The two carpel s after subsequent growth and fusion develop into two stigma and two short styles. The four ovules are exposed before the complete fusion of carpels. They are partially separated by incomplete septum afertward.

N2  - Embryology of Ipomaea macrantha R. & S., Ipomaea hederifolia L. and Ipomaea pes-caprae (L.) Sweet. has been investigated. Anther wall development is of the Dicotyledonous type and at maturity consists of the endothecium, 1-2 middle layers and secretory tapetum. Tapetum is also formed from the connective. Microspore mother cells undergo simultaneous divisions and produce and are mostly 2-celled at anthesis. Rarely 3-celled grains occur in I. macrantha. Ovary is superior, bicarpellary, syncarpous and bilocular with two anatropous, unitegmic and crassinucellate ovules in each locule on axile placentation. Archesporium is single celled. Megaspore mother cell undergo meiotic division and produce a linear tetrad of megaspores of which the chalazal one develops into an 8-nucleate embryo sac of the Polygonum type. Antipodals are ephemeral. Fertilization is porogamous. Syngamy and triple fusion occurs almost simultaneously. Endosperm is nuclear. Embryo development is of the sherardia variation of the Solanad type. Suspensor is large and haustorial.

N2  - This study analyzes the content of the pollen loads collected by honeybees in the town of Ming-Chien in Nantou County, located in the middle of Taiwan, during the one year period 1991 and investigates the pollen gathering activity of Apis mellifera. This study identified 106 pollen taxa belonging to 56 angiosperm families, one Lycopodium spore and one fungus spore. Among the pollen identified, 12 species belong to Compositae, 9 to Leguminosae, 7 to Euphorbiaceae, 5 to Solanaceae and 4 to Gramineae. Pollen of Camellia sinensis occupies the highest frequency (28.69%), followed by the Ageratum conyzoides and A. houstonianum (18.95%), Mimosa pudica (6.85%), Oryza sativa (5.98%), Citrus grandis (5.80%) and Humulus scandens (4.72%). Honeybee collects pollen from both entomophilous and anemophilous plants. Cultivated plants and wild plants are both equally important pollen sources. Factors that affect pollen gathering activity of the bees include the morphology and color of the flower, time of anthesis, distribution of plants, temperature and humidity. Most of the pollen source plants have the following features: yellow or white flowers with opened petals and exposed anther, noon-time anthesis and location close to the hive.

N2  - In order to clone a Cu/Zn-SOD gene from Aspergillus japonicus, the highly conserved regions of the SOD sequence of maize and other species were compared and two oligonucleotides were synthesized. The Aspergillus japonicus cDNA was then used as the template to get a 0.3 kb fragment by PCR technique. The 0.3kb DNA fragment has high homology compared with maize SOD-4 cDNA. Then we used the 0.3kb fragment as probe to screen Aspergillus japonicus genomic libraries. A 0.4 kb DNA frgment from purified positive plaque was subcloned into pGEM-7zf(+) vector and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this clone revealed that it comprised an open reading frame coding for 120 amino acid residues. The encoded polypeptide is highly homologous with other plant SODs. The residues required for coordinating copper and zinc are also conserved as they are among all reported Cu/Zn-SOD sequences.

N2  - Fifty eight form genera, one hundred and thirty four form species of fossil sporomorphs were reported from the early Cretaceous formations based on materials from seventeen exploration wells in Taiwan. Among these reported, there are fourty-five form genera and ninty eight form species of pteridophytic spores, eleven form genera and twenty six form species from gymnospermous grains, and two form genera ten form species of angiospermous grains and one form genus and one form species of algal species. These early Cretaceous sporomorphic assemblages are predominated by gymnospermous forms in species quantity but by pteridophytic forms in species diversity. Angiospermous species are only represented by primitive monocolpate and trucolpate pollen grains.

N2  - RT-PCR was used for the SOD-DNA amplification from rice total RNA in a two-step reaction. Using this PCR-made SOD-DNA as the probe to screen a rice λgt11 cDNA library, four putative clones of CuZnSOD were isolated. The clone having the largest insert was subcloned and sequenced. This cDNA clone had a full-length open reading frame of 459bp corresponding to 152 amino acid residues and the derived amino acid sequence from this clone matched the cytosolic CuZnSOD isozyme. Its amino acid sequence showed approximately 99 and 86% identity to rice and corn CuZnSOD sequences. Northern blot hybridization showed that the heat-shock, drought-treated rice seedlings had the enhanced transcripts of CuZnSOD. Genomic Southern analysis indicated that CuZnSODs in rice was encoded by multigenes.

N2  - The relationships among Ajuga formosana Hay., Paraphlomis gracilis (Hemsl.) Kudo and P. parviflora Wu & Li have been confusing for a long time. Kudo (1929) treated A. formosana as conspecific with P. gracilis. We accept the generic name Paraphlomis, and we found that the Taiwan specimens so named P. gracilis are different form those of mainland Chinese ones on the basis of their external and pollen morphology and geographical distribution. Therefore, we propose a new combined name, i. e., P. formosana (Hay.) Hsieh & Huang, comb. nov. for the Taiwan plants. The name of P. parviflora was based on the specimen collected by Suzuki and is considered to be conspecific th P. formosana. The chromosome number of P. formosana (2n = 34) is also reported.

N2  - Salt-acclimated soybean plants had higher activities of glutathione reductase and of its related enzymes, ascorbate peroxidase, and dehydroascorbate reductase, than those of non-acclimated plants grown under the salt-stress condition. Those enzymes, which mainly distributed in different organelles under normal growth condition, became predominantly in cytosol under this adverse environment. Those H2O2 scavenging enzymes might protect the plasma membrane of leaf cells from lipid peroxidation. The maintaining of integrity of plasma membrane of leaf cells by reduction of the lipid peroxidation might reduce the level of ionic leakage out of cells, and so favors plants to adapt the salt-stress environment. Besides, the glutathione reductase also kept high ratio of GSH/GSSG in cytosol. The high ratio of GSH/GSSG may have positive effects on plants to tolerate the salt-stress environment.

N2  - We examined the chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoid contents, and the three intermediates (protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), magnesium protoporphyrin IX (MGPP) and protochlorophyllide (Pchlide)) of Chl biosynthetic pathway in the exocarp of orange fruit during its late ripening stage. While Chl content declines by 12 folds, carotenoid content always remains similar level. meanwhile, the ratios of Chl a/b, carotenoid/Chl and Pchlide/Chl alter from 1.51 to 4.42 from 0.22 to 2.74 and from 1.00 to 0.07, respectively. It is, therefore, concluded: (a) the deficiency of carotenoid is not directly accompanied by the deficiency of Chl; (b) the degradation rate of Chl b is faster than that of Chl a; (c) the degradation rate of PPIX is slower than that of MGPP and Pchlide; and (d) as ripening takes place, the residual Pchlide is more easily forwarded to Chl.

N2  - The genus Asarum of Taiwan is revised on the bases of morphology, pollen features and karyotype analysis. Six species including two new ones are recognized, i.e. A. caudigerum Hance, A. crassusepalum S. F. Huang, T. H. Hsieh & T. C. Huang, sp. nov., A. epigynum Hayata, A. hypogynum Hayata, A. macranthum Hook. F. and A. taipingshanianum S. F. Huang, T. H. Hsieh & T. C. Hunag, sp. nov. These six species can also be identified by using the pollen features alone. The pollen grains are characterized by inaperturate or 4-6-colpoidate. The chromosome number is 2n=24 except A. epigynum with 2n=12. The evidences from different karyotypes and their geographical distribution data make it possible to reconfirm that the center of origin for this genus is South West China. It is also suggested that the plants of Asarum of Taiwan are derived from South China since their karyotypes are within the range of the South China.

N2  - A new record of Pediastrum, P. asymmetricum Yamagishi et Hegewald, is reported in Taiwan. It is characterized by its asymmetric marginal cells and global cell wall ornaments, features which other Pediastrum species do not share in common. It was found in five water reservoirs situated in the north and southwest of Taiwan, coexistant with P. simplex Meyen. The results of water quality analysis point out that this species grows in eutrophic or mesotrophic waters. The physicochemical environment in which it occurs is discussed in the present paper.

N2  - The formation of lenticels on the branches of Ficus microcarpa L. F. was examined. Beneath the stomata of a young branch, the division of precomplementary cells progressed from the cortex inwards and then the lenticel phellogen was formed. It was found to be continuous with the phellogen of periderm. The phellogen of the lenticel centrifugally produced a compact suberized closing layer and then one to four layers of unsuberized complementary cells. The mature lenticels are lens-shaped and convex towards both the exterior and interior. They are centrifugally composed of phylloderm, lenticel phellogen, and several strata of complementary cell layers alternated with a single closing layer. In the lenticel, some prismatic calcium oxalate crystals and several rows of radially arranged tannin cells were observed. Lenticel hypertrophy arose in the immersed mature internodes. It was characterized by large and loosely interconnected thin-walled cells.

N2  - Ten-day old seedlings germinated from seeds of tested plants obtained from commercial sources and Cu-polluted open field were transferred to a Hoagland's solution containing various concentration of copper. Young plants grew better in Hoagland's solution containing 2 μM copper than that of plain one. Among eighteen tested plants, Miscanthus floridulus and Dianthus barbatus were more tolerant to excess copper. Most Cu-treated plant showed growth retardation in root and shoot, and sometimes leaf chlorosis. Structural changes of cells induced by copper toxicity were found in extracellular matrix and intracellular organelles. Breakage of membrane systems frequently appeared in various tissues of susceptable plants. Chloroplast abnormalities occurred in leaf tissues. Electron-dense granules were found in cell wall, vacuoles, chloroplast and cytoplasm. Acid phosphatase and peroxidase are verified to be the potential markers for the plants in response to coppper stress.

N2  - Six groups of ribonucleases (RNases) activities from Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas Lam. Cv. Tainong 57) leaves were identified and characterized by an RNA-cast polyacrylamide gel. Among these ribonucleases, five were major isoforms, and were designated to A-E groups, ranged in size from 14 to 47 kilodalton. They were consistently expressed in root, stem and leaf. In addition, a novel RNase isoform, designated F group, with a molecular mass about 6000 dalton, expressed specifically in the aging leaf. In this paper the biochemical properties of six groups RNase isoforms were characterized with catalytic ions, pH value, denaturing reagent of SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol.

N2  - Efforts were made to study effects of potassium (K) on the movement of amino acids and sugars into maize (Zea mays L.) kernels and the relationship between grain yield and lodging severity. Developing kernels of maize hybrid B73 × Mo17 were incubated in vitro in a reaction mixture containing 50 mM 3H-glutamine, 200 mM 14C-sucrose, and varying amounts of K salts to determine K effects on the transport of these organic nutrients into endosperms. Results indicate that the kinetics of K effect on glutamine and sucrose transports were similar, and the movement of these two organic nutrients into endosperms reached a maximum level when K concentrations increased to 100 mM. The degree of stimulation declined at higher levels of K. There was a positive correlation between grain yield and lodging severity for the four maize hybrids B73 × LH51, FS854, LHE136 × LH82, and A632 × LH39 evaluated. The relationship between dry matter accumulation in kernels and lodging severity of stalk was discussed.

N2  - Plants treated with sodium floride showed the retardation of plant growth in shoot and root systems. In vitro, sodium floride also inhibits the activity of acid phosphatase activity. It is a noncompetitive inhibitor of acid phosphatase extracted from rice seedlings. Its Km value for p-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) was 0.33 mM and Ki value for NaF is 0.23 mM. Crude extract of acid phosphatase from rice seedlings has four major groups of isozymes (group I, II, III, and VI). Group I isozymes are more tolerant to NaF, gropus III are more sensitive (group III) and the rest are intermediate.

N2  - Pollen of 18 species of Ipomoea in Taiwan was examined in LM and SEM. Light microscope study of pollen morphology has shown that all examined species share common pollen morphological characters - spherical shape, pantoporate apertures and tectum with spinulate processes. On the basis of exine stratification, two different groups of this genus were defined: The Group 1 pollen include I. acuminata and 9 other species, possess spines, extraporal regions and tetragonal to hexagonal areas. The pores are surrounded by an extraporal region, and the spines and the ridges of the bacula form a tetragonal to hexagonal area around each extraporal region. Each pore is covered with an operculum which is peeled off after acetolysis. Fine reticula are present all over the surface of the grain. The reticula consist of very minute lumina. The Group 2 pollen include Ⅰ. obscura and 7 other species. The extraporal regions and tetragonal to hexagonal areas are absent. Minute lumina are also present all over the surface of the grain. A key for distinguishing Taiwan's various species of Ipomoea, based on exine stratification and spinal characteristics, was made.

N2  - Fifty eight form genera, one hundred and thirty four form species of fossil palynomorphs were reported from the early Cretaceous strata based on materials from seventeen exploration wells in Taiwan. Among these, there are fourty-five form genera and ninety eight form species of pteridophytic spores, eleven form genera and twenty six form species of gymnospermous grains, and two form genera and ten form species of angiospermous grains and one form genus and one form species of algal spores. These early Cretaceous palynomorphic assemblages are predominated by gymnosperms in species quantity but by pteridophytes in species diversity. Angiospermous species are only represented by primitive monocolpate and tricolpate pollen grains. The flora assemblages of the early Cretaceous of Taiwan might suggest a tropical to subtropical climate at that time and the plant community was dominated by coastal scrub plants such as Classopollis. More landwards, the flora was replaced by pteridophytic Cyatheaceae and gymnospermous Classopollis savanna plants in which local pteridophytic grassland was also common.

N2  - There are three distinguished types of septal structures in ascogenous hyphae and ascal bases, namely aleuroid-, pulvinuloid- and otideoid-type found in the tribes of Aleurieae, Lachneae and Otideae (Humariaceae). These septal structures provide solid evidences that Humariaceae has strong phylogenetic relationship with Helvellaceae and Ascobolaceae. The apothecial characters such as carotenoid pigment, excipular hair, or habitat are not adequate to delimit a family; instead, septal structures seem to be more conservative and could be used in the revision of families in the Discomycetes.

N2  - Embryology of Indigofera cordifolia and I. linifolia has been studied. The anthers are tetrasporangiate. The anther wall comprises of an epidermis, middle layer and tapetum. Anther tapetum is of the glandular type and the cells are uniseriate and uninucleate. Endothecium develops fibrous thickenings when the pollen grains at 2-celled stage. Meiosis is normal and successive cytokinesis leads to the formation of tetrahedral and decussate microspore tetrads. Pollen grains are triporate and 2-celled at the time of shedding. The ovules are campylotropous, bitegmic and crassinucellate. Meiosis in megaspore mother cell leads to the formation of linear tetrad of megaspores, The chalazal megaspore of the tetrad is functional and develops into monosporic Polygonum type of embryo sac. Antipodals are three in number and are ephemeral.

N2  - The septal structure at ascal base in the Ascobolaceae and the tribe of Ciliarieae(Humariaceae sensu Rifai) has a very similar hemispherical band as Otideae (Humariaceae). However, the septal structures of these three groups of cup fungi show different types of septal development, namely ascoboloid-, scutellinioid-, and otideoid-type. Species showing the same types of septal structures in the pores of mature asci, but exhibiting transitional differences in their early development stages , indicate a possible monophyletic origin of these groups. The study of septal development may be potentially of great use in the study of phylogeny in the Pezizales.

N2  - During the development of the levels and sepals of Justicia procumbens, the formations of lithocysts, trichomes, and diacytic stomata in both adaxial and abaxial epidermises exhibited the regular distribution patterns, The means of densities and lengths of the lithocysts in the leaves were higher and longer in the adaxial epidermis than in the abaxial epidermis, in the central area than the marginal area, and in the basal area than the leaf apex respectively. The mean densities of lithocysts increased during the early developmental stages of leaf, but in the later stages, because the enlargement of the lithocysts and the neighboring ordinary cells, they decreased obviously. The lithocysts associated with the midrib and the primary or secondary veins of the leaf were elongated along the vein axis. Elsewhere in the leaf, the axes of the lithocysts were parallel to the leaf margin or oblique relative to the midrib and showed a correlation between the leaf development and the lithocyst elongation. In the sepals the lithocysts were found only in the abaxial epidermis. They were all parellel to the midrib. The mean densities and lengths of lithocysts were higher and larger in the older sepals than those in the younger sepals. On the other hand, the densities of lithocysts in the sepal were higher than those in the leaves.

N2  - Tripsin inhibitor(Ti) activities in sweet potato(Ipomoea batatas Lam.) leaves and roots from five local cultivars were analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE. At qualitative level, it showed that two forms of Ti were present in both organs, with Mr. 31,000 Da and 14,000 Da in levels, and Mr. 31,000 Da as well as 21,000 Da in roots, respectively. At quantative level, the Ti activities varied among this cultivars. The level of trypsin inhibitory activity was closely related with pest resistance. More Ti activity conferred strong insect resistance on several cultivars, i.e. Tainong 34 and 65. Finally, the data of immunostain with anti-sporamin antiserum demonstrated that Tis from leaves were different from those of roots in sweet potato.

N2  - This study compares the accuracy of various pollen counting methods in order to find an optimum sample size for the study of air-borne pollen obtained from Burkard seven-day volumetric recording trap in Taiwan. Pollen species counts and estimates of pollen quantity obtained using various sample sizes are compared. The coefficients of variance of various sample sizes and diurnal variations in pollen concentration are also analyzed. The results show that a minimum sampling of one transverse traverse per hour or every two hours from trapping tape is suitable for the estimation of the total pollen quantity collected an a day and for the study of diurnal variations in pollen concentration at a collecting station.

N2  - The interactions between the pollen grains of Thalictrum flavum, and the microscopical fungi of Gliocladium roseum were investigated with a TEM instrument of high resolution (2-3 A). The results are the following: 1. The pollen coat and the outermost part of the fungal cell wall have the same electron density. 2. The endoplasmatic reticulum can be demonstrated in the highly magnified pictures of the fungal protoplasm. 3. On the basis of the new TEM data, it is possible that the bacterial action plays an important role in the investigated microbial-pollen interaction. 4. The pollen coat is easily digested by the enzymes of the microbial organisms. 5. The outermost surface of the tectum is also degradable enzymatically. 6. On high magnification the outermost part of the fungal cell wall, and the tectum is very similar. At this biopolymer level, in some cases it is not easy to distinguish them. 7. In consequence of the microbial-pollen interactions enzymatically exposed microchannels of 2-4 A in diameter were also discovered. Similar, but more characteristic system was observed on the fungal cell wall. This may play a role in the diffusion of the enzyme.

N2  - The Normapolles and other related palynomorphs from Paleocene to Early Eocene in China were discussed using materials mainly from Caomuhao Gypsum Mine from Sanmenxia, Henan. A total of 48 genera and 152 species (including 22 indeterminable forms) were described. The distribution of the normapolles, along with other key taxa such as Aquilapollenites and proteaceous pollen during the Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary, had divided China into two phytogeographic provinces-Central and Northeast. The former is characterized mainly by the presence of Normapolles and the latter by the presence of Aquilapollenites. The Central Province can be further subdivided into Southeast and Northwest subprovinces with Aquilapollenites also present in the former but absent in the latter. The representative assemblage from each province and subprovince and their climatic implication were also discussed.

N2  - The outdoor fungal airspora in urban Hualien has been investigated based on one year's collection (from April 1993 to March 1994) by the agar plate method. Among the fungi isolated , the majority (59.84%) comprised species of Cladosporium (33.18%), Aspergillus (11.06%), yeasts (7.41%), Penicillium (3.94%), Fusarium (1.73%), Curvularia (1.50%) and Alternaria (1.02%). All these fungi occurred every month. Spore showers occurred for yeast on July 1993 and for Aspergillus on January 1994. The mean number of colonies forming on the agar plates in the morning exposure was higher than during noon or afternoon exposure. This phenomenon is significantly correlated with the diurnal relative humidity. Summer is the season with the highest number of colonies formed. The month with the highest number of colonies formed was July 1993.

N2  - Soybean seedlings were grown under NaCl-stress and non-stress conditions. To induce salt stress, the water potential of Hoagland solution, which was used to culture the soybean plants, was adjusted to -1.6 MPa daily with saturated NaCl solution. Leaf plasma membranes were isolated and assayed for lipid content, phospholipid class composition, and the fatty acid composition of total phospholipids of plasma membranes. Lipid phase transition temperature and lipoxygenase activity were also measured. The plasma membrane contained a higher concentration of phospholipid than that of glycolipid. The phospholipid(PL) contained higher contents of saturated fatty acids than that of unsaturated fatty acids. Under salt-stress, the ratio of saturated/unsaturated fatty acids became higher, and the enthalpy of lipid phase transition in leaf plasma membranes was raised . A large increase in the lipoxygenase activity in salt-stressed plasma membranes may have contributed to the decline in PL. These results suggest that the plasma membrane of leaves from soybean plants grown under the salt-stress became solidified, and this solidification of the plasma membrane might be the limiting factor that restricts plant growth under salt-stress environments.

N2  - For the last 175 years the name Ipomoea slaphylina has been applied throughout much of tropical Asia to one of the few lianoid species of Ipomoea found there. Study of herbarium specimens and living plants revealed that three distinct taxa are passing under the name I. slaphylina. Two problems emerged: a pernicious confusion dating back to the 1930s, in which collections of Merremia boisiana (Gagnepain) Ooslslroom were misidentified as I. slaphylina, and, a taxonomic problem that requires delimitation of two similar species of Ipomoea, both heretofore called I. sraphylina. The nomenclature is discussed for names pertinent to this taxonomic problem and all names are typified. A key to the three similar taxa and an illustration of their diagnostic characters are provided to aid in recognizing them. The synonymy and geographic distribution are summarized for the two species of Ipomoea and an index of numbered collections examined is provided.

All the loads were unifloral representing 15 families and 18 taxa of both entomophilous and anemophilous angiosperms. The taxa belonging to the family Compositae were most dominant (34.7%) followed by Gramineae, Labiatae and Leguminosae (10% each). Besides, eleven minor sources of alternate bee flora have been highlighted in order to provide information on bee pasture to maintain continuous pollen/nectar or both pollen and nectar flow to the beehive for successful thriving of apiaries which is a prerequisite for lavish honey production.

A study was conducted to observe the seasonal changes in nodular nitrogenase activity (C2H2 reduction) and uptake hydrogenase activity of C. equisetifolia. Nodules showed significant (P≤0.05) seasonal variation in the nitrogenase and hydrogenase activities which were highest during June (13.52 μmoles C2H4‧g^(-1) fresh nodule wt. hr^(-1) and 2.55 μmoles H2 consumed g^(-1) fresh nodule wt. hr^(-1), respectively) and lowest during December (0.55 μmoles C2H4‧g^(-1) fresh nodule wt. hr^(-1) and 0.23 μmoles H2 consumed g^(-1) fresh nodule wt. hr^(-1), respectively). This study has many important and applied ecological implications in the management of horticulture and agroforestry systems of the tropics.

N2  - A 24 kDa phloem protein was isolated from phloem exudate of Luffa cylindrica fruits by the method of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Polyclonal antibodies obtained from rabbit serum recognized both the native protein and denatured protein subunits. Immunofluorescent study was done by a FITC-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG. Immunolabelled sections of pepo show that the antibodies strongly bound with 24 kDa protein in the bicollateral phloem tissues of vascular bundle. The intensity of green fluorescence is related to the degree of phloem differentiation. Similar results were also observed in stems and petioles of leaves.

N2  - Legume-Rhizobium symbiosis contribute substantially to nitrogen economy of the soil with global utilization in sustainable agricultural systems. Due to the immense importance of legumes, nodulation was studied in 66 Papilionoid species from Sacramento Valley in California. Majority of the species were abundantly nodulated under natural soil conditions or when grown in uninoculated garden soil indicating distribution of wide range of naturalized rhizobia. Nodulation in 12 species within 6 genera is reported for the first time. The general account presented here is essentially first step in quantifying the contribution of these nodulated species to the nitrogen cycle of the biosphere.

N2  - Pollination ecology of Eremostachys superba Royle ex Benth. (Labiatae) from the Siwaliks of Uttar Pradesh, India, is discussed. The low population strength was found to be responsible for pollinator limitation in the species. This species is adapted for cross-pollination by oligolectic pollinivorous bees, Nomia rustica and Ceratina heiroglyphica of the order Hymenoptera. The bees were pollinivorous and eutropic in nature and exhibited floral fidelity behaviour while foraging for pollen. Their visitations to the flowers were ethodynamic, but scanty. The flowers, in turn, were oligophilic and pollination mechanism was sternotribic. A specialized plant-pollinator co-adaptation existed in this critically endangered species which is exposed to a high reproductive bottleneck.

N2  - In an effort to elucidate the mechanism of redistribution of a 57 KDa protein from chloroplasts to cytoplasmic polysomes when maize seedlings encounterd a stress, maize genotypes resistant or susceptible to Bipolaris maydis were used for evaluation under inoculated or heat-shocked conditions. Western blot analysis indicated, that the redistributed 57KDa protein caused by a treatment with pathogens or heat shock was identical. When maize seedlings were resistant to pathogens, little amount of this protein could be detected in the cytoplasmic polysome fraction; cytoplsmic polysomes in response to stresses is not unique to maize. A preliminary study employing a compatible Phytophthora megasperma-soybean interaction system indicated that soybean also respond to pathogenic stress in that the 57KDa protein was detected in the preparation of cytoplasmic polysomes.

N2  - We investigated the effect of two heating patterns, quick and gradual, on the relative degradation rate of chlorophyll, carotenoid, and the three intermediates, Protoporphyrin IX(PPIX), Magnesium protoporphyrin IX(MGPP) and Protochlorophyllide(Pchlide), of chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway in three vegetable leaves. The data showed that (1)all pigments declined under both patterns of heating, however, the relative degradation rate of quick heating is greater than that of gradual heating; (2)The mechanism of all investigated pigments is a two-step reaction; (3)The relative degradation rate of chlorophyll is slower than that of carotenoid; (4)The relative degradation rate of chlorophyll a is faster than of that of chlorophyll b; (5)the relative degradation rate of protochlorophyllide is slower than that of magnesium portoporphyrin IX, which is slower than that of portoporphyrin IX; (6)nutrient content after gradual heating within 30 min is better than quick heating within the same period. We concluded that the degradation of leaf in nature is different from that in the heating condition of water.

N2  - A 6.8 kDa ribonuclease protein was found in the protein extract of the diseased periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don) infected by the phytoplasma of loofah witches' broom, but not in that of the healthy plants. This protein has an isoelectric point between 4 and 5. Further analyses revealed that it had a broad optimum pH of 3 to 8, and was sensitive to inhibition by CaCl2 (2 mM) and MgCl2 (2 mM) and less seneitive to ZnCl2 (50 μM), but insensitive to EDTA (250 mM) and NaCl (5mM).In order to investigate if this RNase could also be induced by other factors, the healthy periwinkle were given different environmental stress treatments including heat shock, drought, ethanol, and abscisic acid. None of these treatments induced the expression of this phytoplasma-related RNase protein.

N2  - Fungal infestation of pollen wall and cytoplasm is common in Strelitzia and Ravenala (Strelitziaceae) after anther dehiscence. The exine, rarely more than 0.1 μm thick, is not degraded by these infestations. Fungal hyphae enter the pollen grain cytoplasm through ruptures in the exine caused by osmotically shocked protoplasm or mechanical damage. We find no evidence that fungal enzymes or other microbes breach the thin exines of this family.

N2  - Two full-length and two partial cDNAs encoding sporamin A have been isolated from sweet potato tuberous roots. Sequence comparisons show that they are very similar with 94-98% homology at nucleotide level, and 80-88% at protein level. All four cDNAs possess multiple alternate polyadenylation signals in the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR). Genomic Southern blot analysis indicates the presence of a sporamin multigene family in sweet potato. High levels of sporamin mRNAs were detected in developing tuberous roots, but they disappeared at the sprout-germinating stage. Differential expression of these genes was obvious as their mRNAs were present specifically in developing roots, rarely in stems and not in leaves.

N2  - There are multiple forms of manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) in rice extract, which can be separated by native gel electrophoresis. We have isolated two rice cDNA clones encoding Mn-SOD designed as msod1 and msod2. The two clones contain 951 and 1352 bps with sequence identity of 85.27% in full length and 98.71% in the coding region. However, the 5' regions prior to the first in-frame start codon (113bp in msod1 and 511bp in msod2) are only 59.29% identical, but the 3' untranslated regions (142bp in msod1 and 145bp in msod2) share 85.92% similarity. Genomic Southern analysis indicates that multiple genes encoding Mn-SOD in rice are multiple in nature.

N2  - Soybean plants were grown under salt-stressed condition (Ψw=-1.6 Mpa) without or with previous acclimation at Ψw=-1.2 Mpa. The chloroplasts that isolated from those salt-stressed plants were incubated with [14C] acetate. The chloroplast membranes were then subfractionated using linear density sucrose gradient centrifugations into outer envelope membrane (o. e. m.) and inner envelope membranes (i. e. m.). The acyl-CoA synthetase and UDP-galactose diacylglycerol galactosyltransferase activities in both envelope membranes were assayed. Oleic and palmitic acid were the major fatty acids in lipid of these two envelope membranes. Salt-stress reduced chloroplasts to synthesize oleic and palmitic acid, but acclimation caused chloroplasts to recover partially the levels of fatty acids biosynthetic activity. Oleic and palmaitic acid contents in lipid of o.e.m. increased from 6 to 19 %, and 4.6 to 17 % of the control levels if plants had acclimated previously to Ψw=-1.2 Mpa. The concentrations of these two kinds of fatty acid in lipid of i.e.m., likely in o.e.m., were recovered from 1.8 to 45 %, and 4.6 to 17 % of the control ones. Over-all, lipid biosynthesis in i.e.m. of chloroplast were more sensitive to salt-stress treatment compared to o.e.m.. This suggested that activities of lipid biosynthesis in i. e. m. of chloroplast might have a regulatory mechanism for plants to adapt the salt-stressed environment.

With the characters observed on fossil as well as evidence from palaeobotanical works and teratology, the authors have discussed the propinquity and possible evolutionary relationship with other families of Pinaceae as well as other groups of conifers and thought: 1) there was a series starting from Pseudovoltzia, through Tricanolepis and Schizolepis, leading into extant conifers; 2) the different parts of scale and bract have been undergoing a coalescence; 3) seed wings have undergone a process from non-existence, advent to fully development; and 4) more attention should be paid to the Lycopsida for the consideration of ancestral conifers.

N2  - The endangered species Eremostachys superba Royle ex Benth. Is pollinated by a bee, Nomia rustica West. Scanning Electron Micrographs of the pollen loads attached to the insect body revealed that there is no pollen mixing. The unornamented pollen adhere together by their sticky 'pollenkitt' and get trapped by the dense setae of the bee's hind legs. Precise placement of pollen on the stigma is thereby ensured.

N2  - An aeropalynological study was performed in the Tan-Shui area of Taipei County during 1993. A total of 128 taxa belonging to 77 families were identified. The dominant pollen were of genera Broussonetia (73.7%), Trema (7.4%), Boehmeria (2.8%), and Ardisia (2.4%). There were two major pollen seasons: March to May and August to October. The major pollen types changed with seasons: tree pollen in spring, fern spores with some weed pollen in summer and weed pollen in autumn. The majority of collected pollen were of anemophilous species. There existed a diurnal variation in the amount of airborne pollen within a day: with the highest peak occurring in the morning. On the basis of the present study, a pollen calendar was provided for the Tan-Shui area.

N2  - Chenia leptophylla (C. Muell.) Zand. is reported here as a new generic and species record to the moss flora of Taiwan. In addition to two strictly distributed species in the Andes, i.e., C. lorentzii (C. Muell.) Zand. and C. suboblinqua (Williams) Zand., C leptophylla is the third taxon of this genus with cosmopolitan distribution. Chenia is distinguished easily from Tortula species and characterized by lingulate leaves with somewhat apiculate apex, crenulate leaf margins, and smooth laminal cells. C leptophylla is closely related to C. lorentzii in sharing common stem structure without differentiated central strands, a character that distinguishes them from C. suboblinqua. C. leptophylla is then diagnosable from C. lorentzii by its acute leaf-apex and rhizoid tubers. Pottia truncate (Hedw.) B.S.G., another pottiaceous mosses with epapillose laminal cells, also shares many gametophytic similarities with C. leptophylla except for its differentiated central strand in stem, ventral stereids in costa and excurrent costa.

N2  - A simple gradient transect of vegetation analysis was used to study the effect of the pollution caused by a copper smelter in northern Taiwan on the development of vegetation in the area. A clear coverage gradient on the vegetation was found near Liiyueh copper smelter after ten years of operation, and an apparent stress gradient was evident in a series of plots in the vicinity on the basis of species diversity and frequency of vegetation found. Miscanthus floridulus was a good indicator plant to gauge the vegetation's response to the stress gradient, and its isozyme pattern of superoxide dismutase was studied in connection with this stress gradient. Four MnSODs and five CuZnSODs were present in the leaves of Miscanthus floridulus. Its SOD activity, and particularly its MnSODs, showed obvious accumulation in the stress area. MNSOD of Miscanthus floridulus as a biochemical indicator for copper smelter pollution is discussed.

N2  - Four temperature isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus Fres. from Taiwan and six isolates from several culture collection centers (CBS, ATCC and IMI) were analyzed by random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs). Ten oligonucleotide decamers were used to generate selective markers from genomic DNAs and five primers gave adequate discrimination between isolates. All isolates were classified into four groups by RAPDs that consistent to their physiological characteristics. The results indicate that RAPDs analysis is useful to assess the genetic diversity and intraspecies temperature variation among different temperature strains of Aspergillus fumigatus.

N2  - The seedling morphology was studied in the Nanjenshan forest of southern Taiwan. A total of eighty-one species of woody plants was described and illustrated. Based on initial germination pattern, four types were recognized. The epigeal type of germination is exhibited by the majority of species (64.2%), followed by hypogeal type (18.52%), semi-hypogeal type (14.81%), and durian type (2.47%). Compared to the Malayan forest, the percentage of the epigeal type seems to be no difference, but that of the durian type is considerably lower. For the present study, all species within the same genus show only one seedling type. At family level, however, the types of seedlings are not so uniform.

N2  - Clastoderma debaryanum var. imperatorium, Craterium leucocephalum var. rufum, C. minutum, Didymium perforatum, Physarum alboradianum, P. penetrale, P. plicatum, and P. psittacinum are newly recorded in Taiwan. The new status for Physarum nutans Persoon var. rubrum (Nann.-Brem. & Yamamoto) C.-H. Chung stat. nov. (Basionym: Physarum nutans Persoon f. rubrum Nann.-Brem. & Yamamoto, Proc. K. Ned. Akad. Wet., Ser. C 90: 341. 1987) is proposed. We agree that Clastoderma dictyosporum is synonymous with C. debaryanum, and Physarum laevisporum should be excluded from the myxomycete biota of Taiwan. The occurrence of Perichaena corticalis var. liceoides in Taiwan is confirmed after its first report in 1929. More collections of Arcyria minuta are reported, which has been recorded as A. carnea in Taiwan. SEM micrographs are made for Erionema aureum and Willkommlangia reticulata.

N2  - Pollen morphology of Mesembryanthemum criniflorum L.f. in the plants treated or not treated with gamma irradiation of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 Krad dosages have been studied using LM and SEM. Pollen grains in the control plants are basically 3(-4)-colpate-colporoidate. Besides, parasyncolpate grains occur as a variation. The pollen size is variable having a wide range (P × E: 17-37 × 14-35μm). The pollen sculpture is spinulose-punctate. In the irradiated plants, the pollen size range drastically narrowed down. While the pollen grains of the plants treated with 5, 20, 30, 40 and 50 Krad dosages had the same pollen morphology as in the controls, the plants treated with 10 Krad dosage showed a complete change in the exine ornamentation exhibiting 'Microoverrucate' pattern as against the spinulose pattern, characteristic of the species. Since the apertural character did not deviate from the basic 3-colpate-colporoidate condition, it has been contended that the exine surface pattern and the apertural features may be considered as separate characters controlled by different genes, and that the change in the exine pattern may be attributed to the mutation of the gene/genes controlling he pattern.

N2  - The ultrastructural changes of lenticels on the branches of Ficus microcarpa L. f. during the developmental stages were studied. All the living precomplementary cells, complementary cells, and cells of the linticel phellogen and the closing layer contained a large vacuole, nucleus, mitochondria, plastids, and dictyosome. During the differentiation and maturation of the lenticels, the cell walls of the closing layer, precomplementary cells, and complementary cells were progressively suberized. The electron microscopic examination of the suberized layers in the cell walls showed a lamellar appearance. The suberized outer tangential walls of the mature cells in the fragments were observed. The subcellular localizations of acid phosphatase were mainly distributed in the cell walls and vacuoles near the tonoplast. In the closing layer, acid phosphatase was detected only in the plasmodesmata.

N2  - The critically endangered Eremostachys superba Royle ex Benth. shows almost negligible sexual reproduction under natural conditions (＜=5%) and survives only vegetatively. Investigations on the role of pollination biology in the loss of sexual reproduction revealed a pollinator limitation in the natural habitat. Increased floral attractiveness was provided to counteract this pollinator limitation syndrome by increasing flower density. Observations were made on insect visits and resultant seed set in the ex situ plants and compared with that observed under in situ conditions. Infinite pollinators visited ex situ flowers but affected only 38% seed set, indicating a reduced fertilization due to geitonogamous pollination. These results suggested that lack of sexual reproduction in E. superba was partly due to pollen limitation.

N2  - The vegetation around the Lyari river was mostly dominated by monocotyledonous species viz Paspalidium geminatum, Cyperus laevigatus, Chloris barbata and Aeluropus lagopoides. Nineteen species were recorded on the heap area forming six plant communities, whereas, on the plain area seven species with five communities were ob served. P. geminatum was the most dominant species on both areas, which indicated its tolerance to sewage pollutant. Edaphic characteristics of both areas (pH, CaCO3, organic matter, Na+, K+. Pb++, Zn++, Cu++) showed a significant correlation with the vegetation types. High soil pH, exchangeable sodium and potassium, zinc, copper with low calcium carbonate and organic matter were observed on the plain as compared to the heap area. However, a similar range of lead level was round on both areas. The availability or copper increased with the increase in soil pH on both areas. The availability of copper concentration was found above the toxic permissible limit of 150 ppm on both area s which ranged from 200 to 640 ppm. The concentration of zinc fell under the permissible toxic level and did not exceed 300 ppm.

N2  - The present communication deals with diversity, ecology and distribution of Indian Lactuceae (Asteruceae) which is represented by 10 genera namely Lactuca L., Prenanthes L., Launaea Cass., Sonchus L., Reichardia Roth, Cicerbila Wallr., lxeris Cass., Cnondrilla L., Dubyaea DC. and Youngia Cass., with 80 taxa in India. Among these 9 genera and 51 taxa are from the Western Himalaya, 7 genera and 31 taxa from Eastern Himalaya, 5 genera and 12 taxa from Western and Eastern Ghats and 6 genera and 15 taxa from Gangetic plains. Rajasthan and other part s of the country. The Lactuceae exhibit wide range of variations in its ecological habitats from sea coast to 5000 m in elevations and exhibit enormous diversity both intraspecifically and interpecifically. The Himalayas are shown to be a major centre for Lactuceae diversity and distribution followed by Western Ghats and Gangetic plains. At generic level Lactuca exhibits maximum diversity with 25 species followed by Youngia and Cicerbita, all three are predominantly Himalayan. The genus Dubyaea is endemic to Sino-Himalayan region with 9 species, while 6 of its 9 species are highly localized in this region. The maximum diversity of Lectuceae in the Himalaya is due to a variety of climatic conditions and alitudes which in turn has resulted in diverse habitats. The Lectuceae inhabit, every conceivable habitats and reveals a great amount of variation in the populations of different species. The distribution analysis of Lectuceae reveals that its members are chiefly distributed in the Himalaya and poorly represented in Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats and Gangetic plains.

N2  - The floristic relationship among the Islands of Taiwan proper, Taipingtao (Aba Itu Island) and Tungshatao (Pratas Island) is presented. The floristic relationship is expressed by the similarity index of the two latter floras. The relationship between Taipingtao and Tungshatao is calculated by the index of similarity (Is) of Sorenson (1948) as 59%. Thus, these two islands are not very closely related floristically. When two floras are not comparatiable in size i.e., the size of the large island is more 100 times bigger than that of the small island, the index of common plants (Ic) to express the floristic relationship of the small flora to the large one is proposed. The calculation is based on the common species of two floras divided by the total number of plants of the small island. Thus, the index (Ic) of floras of Taipingtao and Tungshatao to Taiwan proper is 88% and 93% respectively. The index (Ic) of floras of Taipingtao and Tungshatao to a small coastal area of Kenting National Park in Taiwan proper is 84% and 85%, respectively. The close floristic affinity among these islands is mainly due to their high composition of coastal elements in common.

N2  - Two new species of Physarm are reported and illustrated by colored photos and scanning electron micrography. Physarum obpyriforme Liu & Chen sp. Nov. was found in Nanjenshan forest, Kenting National Park, sourthern part of Taiwan. This species is characterized by the pear-shaped or ovoid, more or less laterally compressed, yellow fructification which is sessile with a constricted base. P. cremiluteum Chen & Liu sp. Nov. was collected in the forest of Mt. Shamoa in the vicinity of Taipei. This speceis is diagnosed by the creamy yellow sporangia and lime nodes, the whitish and calcareous stalk, the presence of limeless disc at the base of sporangia, and lacking of columella. Type specimens of these two species are deposited in the Mycological Herbarium of the Botany Department, National Taiwan University, Taipei.

N2  - In the tetrad period of Borago officinalis L. microspores, procolumellae (exine tuft-units) are 70-100 nm in diameter and have striated or coiled substructures. Tufts have a circular core zone that initially can be strongly contrasted and an outer (binder) zone that contrasts weakly. During increase in tuft height the early formed distal diameter of tufts becomes 150 to 200 nm while the new basal part is 70 to 100 nm. Thus for a time these procolumellae are cone-like. Along with this change in shape and height there is a reversal of contrast. For a time the core is only weakly contrasted while the binder zone can be strongly contrasted. It is the binder zone that is striated or coiled. Tectal formation involves elongation or elevation of units distally and reversal of contrast. The binder zone can be darkly contrasted. The procolumellae are now 0.4 to 0.5 µm in height from plasma membrane to the callose special cell wall. The distal portion of procolumellae interdigitate producing a polygonal pattern as seen in oblique sections. A tectum becomes prominent and a foot layer and endexine begin to be evident during the period of loss of the microspore mother cell callose envelope. The apertures become complex before the end of the callose period. As they are formed the plasma membrane is separated from the callose by only about 50 nm. At the margin of these young apertures the glycocalyx matrix tapers from the about 50 nm to the height of the interapertural procolumellae (about 150 nm). The callose of the special cell wall remains until the free microspore period.

N2  - Fresh spores of Equisetum arvense L. were irradiated for 5s, 15s, 30s or 60s, and examined with a transmission electron microscope. Alterations to the fine structure of the spore wall and the protoplasm are described. The exospore was more resistant to X-ray irradiation than to organic solvents, in particular diethylamine. The molecular structure of the spore wall was revealed by the X-ray effect. Resistance of the different layers of the sporomorphs to irradiation and organic solvents is important for understanding the complicated biopolymer system of the sporopollenin.

N2  - The role of plasma membrane H^+ -pumping ATPase in the tolerance to salt stress of soybean plants were studied in the present study. Salt-acclimated plants which had previously acclimated to salt-stress condition accumulated higher concentration of Na^+ in root cells than that of the control and non-acclimated plants. The level of Na^+ accumulation in root cells correlated with the inside-acid proton gradient (ΔpH) across the plasma membrane vesicles. The salt-acclimated plants had higher antiport activity of Na^+ influx /H^+ efflux and H^+ -pumping ATPase activity than that of control and non-acclimated plants. It may be concluded that higher H^+ -ATPase activity favored salt-acclimated plants growing under the salt-stress environment.

N2  - The inflorescences of Thuarea involuta (Forst.) R. Br. Ex R. & S. are composed of 3-7 spikelets in a spatheate spike. The spikelets have two florets. All of them are male, except that the basal spikelet has a bisexual upper floret and a male lower floret. A comparative study on the upper florets of the bisexual and male spikelet by SEM showed that the arrest of the development of gynoecium causes the maleness of the upper florets.

N2  - One-week-old seedling s of Luffa cylindrice were grown in phytotron at 15, 20, 25 and 30 t for four weeks. Growth curves of the plant organs were compared with their fresh weight and size during the cultured period. lsozymes of defensive enzymes and phloem proteins were measured on elctrophorogram of native gel and 2-dimcnstonal gel respectively. Low temperature not only retards plant growth, but also increases the ratio of root/shoot. Leaf blades of plants grown at 25 and 30℃have typical sigmoid growth curve but with different slope factors. Plants grown at 15℃ do not show the normal sigmoid curves in leaf growth. Isozyme patterns in plant grown at 15℃ are changed as follows: two minor bands in group II isozyme of acid phosphatase were induced in green leaf blades and cotyledons; group II isozymes of peroxidase were enhanced in hypocotyls and cotyledons; group III isozyme of acid phosphatase was induced in leaf. All isozyme patterns show the specificity in tissues and developmental stages. One of phloem proteins with molecular weight of 31.5 kDa and pi at 4.9 was induced in plants grown al 15℃.

N2  - In an effort to evaluate the ability of maize inbreds to utilize ammonium-nitorgen (NH4^+-N), seedlings were grown in sand culture and supplemented with different amounts and forms of N. seedlings were harvested at 28 days after planting an determined for gross differences in dry mass, activity of NH4^+-assimilating enzymes. PEP carboxylase, and the ability to take up NH^4+ ion. the results indicate that some inbreds retained the ability to effectively utilize NH^4+, but they adapted various combination of mechanisms to cope with NH^4+ pressure and thereby allowed seedling growth and development in the presence of high NH^4+ concentrations. Thus, plant breeders should be able to exploit this variability and to creat hybrids with enhanced performance under predominantly NH4^+-N conditions.

N2  - The thr attenuator is a DNA element containing a G+C-rich dyad symmetry followed by a run of poly(dT), and is reported to be a rho-independent terminator. The effects of the concentrations of nucleoside triphosphates on the transcription of bacteriophage T7 polymerases were analyzed at the thr attenuator in the supercoiled and linearized DNA templates. T7 RNA polymerase showed high termination efficiency in the low concentration of nucleoside triphosphates at the thr attenuator in the both linearized and supercoiled templates. The thr attenuator in the supercoiled DNA template always caused more T7 RNA polymerase to cease transcription than that in the linearized DNA template. Also, when the concentration of ATP is limited from 5 uM to 150 uM, the transcript production by T7 RNA polymerase was at least two folds more than that in the limited supply of any other nucleoside triphosphates. This indicates that ATP may compete with GTP in affecting transcription of T7 RNA polymerase.

N2  - Both seeds of Sedum formosanum and Sedum morrisonense are oblong in shape. The seed size of S. morrisonense is 1.5-2 times of that of S. formosanum and the seed weight of S. morrisonense is four times of that of S. formosanum. On the outer surfaces of these two kinds of seeds, there are thick cuticular layers. The surface view of seed coats showed that the epidermal cells were all tuberculate but their shapes and arrangements were different between species. The inner spaces of these seeds are almost filled by the embryos. Between the radicle and seed coat there is a layer of endosperm cells. These cells contain predominantly lipid as a nutrient reserve. In the embryo the insoluble reserves are lipid and protein. The ratio of areas of oil bodies and areas of protein bodies in the cotyledonous cells of S. morrisonense (3.57) is higher than that of S. formosanum (1.87).

N2  - The exine of Artemisia vulgaris L. is made up of substructures 10-15 nm in diameter. These are parts of units, referred to as tufts, about 100 nm in diameter which extend from the spinules down through the tectum, columellae, foot layer and endexine. They also protrude from the tectum between the spinules. These tufts have coiled binder subunits around them which in normal (axial) surface views usually appear as ”C”-shaped gyres. Our results show that the resistant exine remaining after degradative treatment consists entirely of tufts. We suggest that the portion of the exine removed by oxidation, plasma ashing, and fast atom erosion is extra tuft sporopollenin.

A total of 14,232 pollen grains of seed plants were counted. The mean of pollen concentration was 1.35 grains/m^3. In the course of a year, airborne pollen was most abundant in spring (late March to May) and least in autumn (from September to November). Most of the pollen grains collected were contributed by urban vegetation and garden trees. The important pollen taxa were Broussonetia (39.10%), Gramineae (10.15%), Casuarina equisetifolia (6.68%), Artrocarpus (5.50%), Chenopodiaceae (5.19%), Macaranga tanarius (4.70%), Alnus formosana (4.40%), Typha angustifolia (3.91%), Humulus scandens (2.66%) and Compositae (2.46%). In the above taxa, the main contributors of tree pollen are members of subclass Hamamelidae. Broussonetia is increasingly important in aeropalynological studies in Taiwan for its high pollen concentration reported in this study as well as many other recent investigations.

N2  - Three genera Apectodinium, Kisselovia and Wetzeliella, the fossil dinoflagellate cysts of Wetzeliellaceae, obtained from Eocene sediments from offshore Keelung in northern Taiwan are reported. Two species of the genus Apectodinium (A. homomorphum (Deflandre & Coookson) Lentin & Williams emend. Harland and A. raritubiformium sp. Nov.), three species of the genus Kisselovia (K. pengchiahsuensis sp. Nov., K. coleothrypta (Williams & Downie) Lentin & Williams and K. taiwaniana sp. Nov.) and four new varieties of the genus Wetzeliella (W. symmetrica var. taiwaniana var. nov., W. symmetrica var. scabrata var. nov., W. articulata var. taiwaniana var. nov. and W. articulata var. scabrata var. nov.) are described. They are distributed sporadically in the Eocene formations, but have not been observed in Oligo-Miocene of Taiwan and may therefore have significance as marker species of Eocene.

N2  - The effects of GTP and ATP on the transcription termination and transcript production of bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase were analyzed at the thr attenuator in the supercoiled and linearized DNA templates. T7 RNA polymerase and the supercoiled or linearized DNA template with the thr attenuator were preincubated with GTP or ATP first, then transcription was started by the addition of all four nucleotides. The results indicated that the termination efficiency of T7 RNA polymerase at the thr attenuator is significantly higher in the supercoiled DNA template than in the linearized one. With the preincubation of GTP, T7 RNA polymerase generates 4-21 times more RNA transcript in the supercoiled than linearized DNA template. Also, in the supercoiled DNA, T7 transcription with the preincubation of GTP produces 3.6-5.0 times more RNA transcript than that without preincubation. This strongly suggests that the topology of DNA template influences the transcript production of T7 RNA polymerase. Moreover, GTP may change the conformation of T7 RNA polymerase in the complex of transcription initiation.

N2  - Light and electron microscopic studies were undertaken on the flower structure and anther dehiscence of Wolffia arrhiza L. The anthesis is protogynous. The pistil and the stamen were located in dorsal flower cavity and the pistil protrude first. The inner structure of the pistil and the stamen described with special notes on the anther dehiscence line and the septal cells. The pistil is comprised of a concave stigma, a style and a unilocular ovary with one orthotropous ovule. The bitegumic ovule is covered with a secretary substance within the ovary. The stamen has a filament and bilobed monothecous anther. The tannin body in the stomial cells as well as stigma and style may act as a deterrent. Meanwhile, the uneven thickening of the septal walls and the massive central vacuole of the septal cells probably aid the dehiscence of the anther sac.

N2  - The phylogeny of Hylocomiaceae in inferred by cladistic analyses of twenty-nine morphological characters and the ontogenetic sequences of paraphyllia, central strands, and axillary hairs. The entire ontogenetic transformations are recognized as characters, and character variation is polarized by outgroup comparisons. Two equally parsimonious trees produced by heuristic searches of PAUP support the monophyly of the Hylocomiaceae, which is closely related to family Hypnaceae, containing eight genera Hylocomium, Loeskeobryum, Leptocladiella, Hylocomiastrum, Neodolichomitra, Macrothamnium, Leptohymenium, and Orontobryum. Hylocomiaceae is diagnosable by sympodial growth-form, excepting Orontobryum. The genera Rhytidium, Rhytidiadelphus, Pleurozium, and Rhytidoposis are excluded from the Hylocomiaceae and comprise a monophyletic family, Rhytidaceae. Based on the reconstructed phylogeny, homology is tested by Patterson's tests of similarity, conjunction, and congruence. In Hylocomiaceae erect leaves without placation and absent of foliose pseudoparaphyllia are found to be symplesiomorphies; at the infrafamilial level erect capsules with reduced peristomes are homologus (i.e., derived from a recent common ancestor). Homoplasies also provide useful insights into understanding the mechanisms of morphological evolution. A complementary methodology synthesizing adaptationist and structrualist perspectives employed. Convergent evolution of paraphyllia in mosses is ascribed to environmental selection. The Bauplan of conducting tissue in mosses is attributed to functional constraints. Reversed evolution of central stands in Loeskeobryum is a manifestation of developmental constraints, which channel the variation of the ontogenetic pathway. Heterochrony by truncating (paedomorphosis) or extending (peramorphosis) the ontogenetic sequences is a common mode of morphological evolution in the Hyloccmiaceae. The parallel evolution of axillary hairs by retention of juvenile morphology at the adult stage in Hylocomiastrum, Hylocomiopsis, and Actionthuidium or extending the terminal stage of ancestral state in Hylocomium, Gallania, and Rhytidium is ascribed to morphological constraints.

N2  - Formosan alder (Alnus formosana (Burk.) Makino), a deciduous native tree in Taiwan, has dominant colonizing ability in open areas from lowland up to 2,500 m. The genetic structure of twenty-two populations of this species was studied by allozyme electrophoresis analysis. In the fifteen enzymes surveyed, 59.1 % of the loci was found polymorphic and the mean effective number of alleles per locus 1.21. The proportion of genetic diversity among the populations studied was 0.02 and the genetic distance among populations ranged between 0.000 to 0.019 with a mean of 0.004. Low genetic differentiation in Alnus formosana may be attributed to high degree of gene flow. However, the significant correlations between allelic frequencies in four loci and the altitude gradient revealed partial genetic variation that correlated with temperature differences.

N2  - An aeropalynological study was conducted within Yangmingshan National Park, Taiwan. At the study site (Hsiao-Kuan-Yin), a Burkard seven-day volumetric pollen trap was used to collect samples from April 1997 to March 1998. Over this period, a total of 64 taxa belonging to 46 families and 54 genera were identified in the pollen assemblage. The decreasing abundance of pollen and spores was in the following sequence: Gramineae (23.1%), Urticaceae (17.2%), Trema (15.3%), Ardisia (7.0%), Broussonetia (5.6%), Cyathea (4.5%), Piper (3.4%), Mallotus (2.9%), other Euphorbiaceae (2.5%), Humulus (1.4%) and Pinus (1.2%). Two major pollen seasons, from March to May and in October, were dominated by arboreal pollen and Gramineae pollen, respectively, while only a small amount of pollen and fern spores were collected from November to February. The major species of pollen also varied by season: Trema dominated in April and May, Ardisia in June, Cyathea in July and August, Mallotus paniculatus in September, Gramineae in October, and Urticaceae and Broussonetia in March. A pollen calendar was constructed to illustrate this seasonal variation in the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of airborne pollen and spores.

N2  - A starch synthase cDNA clone (spss67) was isolated from tuberous roots of sweet potato. This clone contained an open reading frame corresponding to a protein of 608 amino acid residues, which also included three consensus regions of starch synthases. Amino acid sequence analyses showed that the protein product of spss67 shared a high degree of homology with other plant granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI). Comparisons of N-terminal amino acid sequence of spss67 cDNA protein product with that of the native protein isolated from sweet potato indicated that the protein contained a signal peptide of 77 amino acids, and the transit peptide had hydrophobic regions in the initiation and end of peptide that was also present in GBSSI of other plant species. In addition, the protein product of spss67 expressed in E. coli could be recognized by anti-GBSSI antibody of potato. Moreover, this protein exhibited a high activity of starch synthase when amylose was used as a primer, but the activity was not significant when the primer was replaced by amylopectin or glycogen. Studies based on the sequence analyses, western blotting and priming activity indicated that the product of spss67 clone was a GBSSI.

The species was transferred to Gymnosiphon in 1940 as G. nanus (Fukuy. & T. Suzuki) Tuyama, but this name was not adopted in the first edition of Flora of Taiwan. Careful examination of the flowers of this species makes it clear that the species is referable to Gymnosiphon aphyllus Blume which was described from western Java. The species is newly recorded in Taiwan. The type of B. nana Fukuy. & T. Suzuki doesn't exist in Taiwan and Japan, hence the neotype is designated, i. e., T. H. Hsieh 2014 in TAI.

N2  - The genus Rhynchotechum (Gesneriaceae) in Tai wan is revised based on a critical morphological study. Three species and one form are recognized. A new species, Rhynchotechum brevipedunculatum J. C. Wang sp. nov., is here described from Taiwan. After comparing with R. discolor in detail , R. discolor var. incisum (Ohwi) Walker can be distinguished from the fanner only in having incised leaves. Therefore, the taxon is reduced to the rank of form and a new combination, R. discolor forma incisum (Ohwi) Hatusima ex J. C. Wang comb. nov., is proposed here. Calyx-segments shape and inflorescence patterns are shown to be the most useful characters for the classification of Taiwan species. In addition, seed coat micromorphology under scanning electron microscope displays more or less interspecific variation. The meiotic chromosome numbers of all Taiwanese taxa are counted in this paper. All taxa, of which three are determined for the first time, have the same chromosome number (n=10). A key to the taxa of this genus in Taiwan along with description, taxonomic notes, and a line drawing are provided.

N2  - Plants intermediate in appearance between Dumasia miaoliensis and D. villosa subsp. bicolor are assumed to be the result of hybridization. Dumasia miaoliensis has the leaf base truncate, leaves glabrous or pubescent, style and gynophore long and glabrous, pods falcate, black and glabrous and seeds yellowish brown. Dumasia villosa subsp. bicolor has the leaf base acute, leaves soft hairy, style and gynophore short and villose, pods terete, yellowish brown and villose and seeds blue. The putative hybrid is more similar to D. miaoliensis, but has terete pods and short gynophore similar to D. villosa subsp. bicolor. Pollen stainability for D. miaoliensis, the putative hybrid and D. villosa subsp. bicolor is 92.5%, 55.3% and 87.4%, respectively. Dumasia villosa subsp. bicolor occurs in the mountains at 500-2500 m. Dumasia miaoliensis occurs only at Chingchieng and Erpenshong between 1100 and 1500 m. The putative hybrid was found intermixed with or growing near the D. villosa subsp. bicolor and D. miaoliensis.

N2  - The present paper is a part of a series of palynological studies for better understanding the relationship between the genera and subfamilies of the Fabaceae (Leguminosae) in Taiwan. There are 4 genera and 12 species found as native plants of the tribe Millettieae in Taiwan. The pollen grains of these 12 native taxa were studied, using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to examine and photomicrograph their pollen morphology. The pollen morphology of the tribe Millettieae in Taiwan is characterized by similar exine stratification, its columellate interstitium, the discontinuous foot layer, and the differentiated exine ornamentation. The pollen type for this study is based on the features of exine ornamentation and stratification. The genus Pongamia is represented by a single type, the genus Derris by two subtypes, and the genera Millettia and Tephrosia by three subtypes respectively but they can be grouped into 4 main types. Except for the genus Pongamia, the palynological characteristics alone are not sufficient for identification of the genera among the tribe Millettieae in Taiwan.

N2  - A distinct interrupted zone is present in the haustorium of Cassytha filiformis a non-host specific stem parasite. Majority of the xylem elements in the vascular core are perforated. The graniferous tracheary cells were observed in the vascular core of haustorium as well as in the parasite stem for the first time. Histochemical studies confirmed the proteinaceous nature of granules. Tracheary cells containing granules were examined using scanning electron microscope. The structure in relation to function of the tracheary cells and their granules are discussed in the light of earlier work.

N2  - Nodal explants from aseptic seedlings of Hildergardia populifolia cultured on Murashige and Skoog's (MS) medium supplemented with 2 mgL^(-1) N^6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) generated very few shoots over a period of 30 days. Shoots were rooted in vitro on 1/2 strength MS macro salts containing 2 mgL^(-1) naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). A significant achievement in the present investigation was the production of somatic embryos from immature zygotic embryo explants exposed to MS medium supplemented with NAA 3 mgL^(-1) and casein hydrolysate (CH) 1000 mgL^(-1) over a period of 60 days. Subsequent withdrawl of NAA and CH from the medium resulted in the maturation and growth of embryos into plantlets on MS medium. The plantlets were transferred to sand: manure: soil mixture (1:1:1) where they showed no visual abnormalities in morphological characters.

N2  - Casuarina equisetifolia Linn. is an introduced actinorhizal plant grown as roadside ornamental tree and as forest plantation in Pakistan. Actinorhizal nodules are formed on the roots of C. equisetifolia as a response to infection by Frankia. Structure of C. equisetifolia nodules is described using histochemical methods to elucidate the nature of micro-symbiont within the nodules. C. equisetifolia nodules were similar to a root in general anatomical structure and resembled with Myrica-type nodules. The nodule consisted of a distinct periderm enclosing the cortex. The cortex showed patches of infected cells interspersed among uninfected ones. Inside the cortex there was a stele bounded by an endodermis, which contained tannins. The phloem-xylem relationship was amphicribral. A poorly defined meristem was also observed. Apart from simple nodules, dichotomously branched and coralloid nodules were also observed. The stele in simple and branched nodules reached up to the tip of the nodules. The micro-symbiont was observed in the nodule tissues in hyphal form only. The histochemical tests revealed absence of vacuoles and starch grains, and presence of tannins and lignin.

N2  - Mature anthers of Eupatorium serotinum Michx. (Compositae: Eupatorieae) have fully formed pollen grains along with microspores that apparently aborted during several stages in development. The latter are enclosed by acetolysis-resistant sacs. The least developed microspore exine (presumably the youngest stage) consisted of rods about 100 nm in diameter, without spines and mainly without a tectum. A more advanced stage had a discontinuous tectum with many unattached columellae and with cylindrical spines having a flat or slightly convex summit. In the most advanced aborted microspores the tectum was variable but mostly continuous and the spines were greatly increased in diameter and all had rounded distal ends. The special feature of these stages was the gaps in the basal portions of the forming spines. The gaps were open basally and filled with structure of the same appearance as columellae and tectum. These results contribute to direct evidence that microspore exines that had aborted early in their development retain the features in mature anthers of that stage(s) of exine development at the time of their abortion. Providing that the mature anthers also contain mature pollen with fully developed exines (typical of the taxon), then the underdeveloped exines within such anthers can provide information about early development. Underdeveloped exines such as those recovered in intact anthers in sedimentary rocks, may provide information about ontogeny that otherwise would be unobtainable.

N2  - This paper describes a natural hybrid, derived from the putative parent of D. miaoliensis and D. villosa subsp. bicolor. This hybrid is not only morphologically intermediate between its putative parents but also at three loci (Aat-1, Aat-2, Mdh-3) from isozymes data, and twenty-four RAPD bands represent a combination nature in its putative parental species. The nearly complete lack of novel alleles suggest that it is of recent origin and that insufficient time has elapsed for the accumulation of mutation at isozyme loci, but it has little mutations at the DNA level.

N2  - The recalcitrant (desiccation sensitive) seeds of Machilus thunbergii were histochemically and ultrastructurally investigated by using light and electron microscopy. The embryo of mature seed has 4-6 subopposite primary leaves in the plumule. We found two types of idioblastic secretory cells (oil cells and mucilage cells) in the cotyledons, but observed only the oil cells in the embryonic axes. Cells in shoot and radicle meristem of the fresh mature embryo have a large nucleus and small vacuoles. The cytoplasm is dense with organelles, and the plastids contain some starch grains and few oil droplets. Under 75% relative humidity storage condition, the desiccation processes set off the subcellular damages (vacuolation, withdrawal of plasmalemma) of the mature seeds. Such processes intensified with time and ultimately resulted in the loss of viability.

N2  - In the present study an attempt has been made to correlate the different soil factors with the growth of four different species of Isoetes L. Soil collected from natural habitats of Isoetes have been analysed for colour, texture, pH and available plant nutrients. The present analysis revealed that the habit of the plant of different species is influenced by edaphic diversity. It has also been found that the genus Isoetes is one of the most edaphically diversified genera of the pteridophyta. There was certain sensitivity of plant length in relation to the various soil factors. The lower scale of acidity favored the growth of Isoetes. The length of the plant decreases with the altitude. The nutrients like, zinc, manganese, iron and copper present in the soil showed significant relationships with the growth of the plants.

Variation in shape and size of the palisade and hourglass cells, occurrence of double layer of palisade cells in C. mimosoides, absence of endotestal hourglass cells in C. glauca, C. marylandica and C. mimosoides, appeared to be distinguishing characteristics for each species having taxonomic significance. The usefulness of these diagnostic characters of the testa depends on the levels of variation present among the different species of the same genus which may help in designing a key for identifying the taxa at specific level along with other characters of the seed.

N2  - Pollen haploids from Nicotiana tabacum L. cv FCV Special were raised by culturing their anthers on MS medium supplemented with .001mg BAP. The haploid plants were grown to adult stage. They flowered profusely but did not produce seeds. A comparison is made between the haploids and their normal parental diploids with reference to the ontogeny and organization of microsporangium, male gametophyte, megasporangium and female gametophyte. The development of microsporangium and male gametophyte in haploids revealed several interesting features. The events pertaining to the development of sporophytic features of microsporangia in haploids were more or less recapitulative of those in normal parental plants. Meiosis in microsporocytes is highly irregular and commences in a few microsporocytes, precociously, at the sporogenous tissue stage itself. Cytomixis, chromosomal disarray and occurrence of laggards are common. Very few 'tetrads' of irregular configurations are organized. Despite anomalous gametogenesis and production of a few microspores, consistently sterile, the anthers dehisced normally as observed in the parental plants. Megasporogenesis and female gametophyte development were highly irregular and unpatternized in haploids. The ovaries were distinctly smaller and possessed fewer ovules than in the diploids. Many ovules degenerated early in their ontogeny. A few that did not, exhibited merely a semblance of embryo sac development and organization, far from the normal patternized events seen in the normal diploids. A bisporic mode of embryo sac ontogeny is prevalent in the haploid ovules. The female gametophytes exhibited precocious organization but never conformed to a uniform pattern. Very few embryo sacs organized into an 8-nucleate Polygonum type of embryo sac. A few apomictic embryoids were noticed in the haploid ovules.

N2  - The diversity in vegetation and flora of Tons Valley in Garhwal Himalaya has been extensively studied during 1994-98. On the whole 761 species of phanerogams referable to 480 genera and 132 families could be recognised in the flora of Tons Valley. The vegetation predominantly is of forest communities which is evergreen type intermixed with deciduous species. The vegetational diversity of the area is discussed broadly under: forest vegetation, seasonal vegetation, and aquatic and marshy vegetation. An analysis of the phytogeographical affinities of the flora shows that the flora of Tons Valley has affinities with surrounding regions. There is predominance of Indian, Indo-Malayan, African-Asiatic-Australian and Palaeotropical elements in the flora. Euro-Siberian and Sino-Jananese species have also found their ways to the Tons Valley.

Besides the rediscovery of Pithya cupressi, Cheilymenia theleboloides was reported for the first time from Chang-Hwa County, Taiwan. In this study the macroscopic and microscopic morphologies of both Pezizales from Taiwan will be described in detail.

N2  - Mature pollen grains of Betula pendula, Borago officinalis, Calluna vulgaris, Fagus sylvatica, Lilium longiflorum, Pinus sylvestris and spores of Lycopodium clavatum were exposed to 4-Methlymorpholine N-oxide monohydrate (MMNO‧H2O) at 80°C for times varying from 30 minutes to 310 minutes. After 30 minutes microchannnels had expanded from approximately 25 nm to 50 nm in diameter, the channel size during development is approximately 50 nm. After about 5 hours in MMNO‧H2O pronounced changes in exine morphology were observed except in Calluna. Changes in exine morphology of Borago and Pinus involved sporopollenin that our previous studies indicated had been added late in development. Early in development sporopollenin accumulates on Sporopollenin Acceptor Particles (SAPs) that are part of the plasma membrane surface coating (tufts, the unit-structures of exines). Subsequently, late in development, secondary sporopollenin is added between tufts or on their surfaces. At this stage SAP cross linkages permeate the exine. Our interpretation is that MMNO‧H2O, as a potent solvent for polysaccharide, penetrates the exine through the core zone (microchannels) of tufts and tuft cross linkages. When polysaccharide is removed exposure to water and solvents normally used for TEM preparation cause fracture of exine components. Exine changes during MMNO‧H2O in Betula and Fagus may be similarly interpreted since erosion parallels the orientation of the tuft core and its subunits. In Lilium the most slender columellae consisting apparently of one tuft were eroded enough to expose coils of outer (binder) zone. In Lycopodium the MMNO‧H2O resulted in exposure of closely spaced (approximately 10nm) circumferentially oriented lamellae that are grouped into linear structures. These linear structures are circular in cross section and greatly variable in size (most are 100-200 nm in diameter). Scans using atomic force- and scanning tunnelling- microscopy suggest that the mainly longitudinal subunits appear to be helical, and radial cross linkages between the structures can also be discerned. No change, other than enlargement of microchannels, could be seen in the endexines of the species studied. Our interpretation is that the greater resistance of the endexine than the ectexine is due to close packing of tufts without any secondary deposition of sporopollenin.

N2  - Seven species of Cyatheaceae are native to Taiwan. Sphaeropteris lepifera, Alsophila denticulata, A. metteniana, and A. podophylla produced 64 spores per sporangium, whereas A. loheri, A. spinulosa, and A. fenicis produced 16 spores per sporangium. Spore germination was Cyathea-type, except in A. denticulata and A. metteniana. In these two species, the rhizoid formation was delayed. Gametophytes of all seven species usually underwent Drynaria-type development, but a few gametophytes of all seven species exhibited Adiantum-type development. Multicellular, scale-like hairs on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the midrib cushion increased in size and changed shape with age. These scale-like hairs distinguish Cyatheaceae gametophytes from the gametophytes of other fern families. The first three or four fronds of young sporophytes lacked midribs. Uniseriate to multiseriate and club-shaped pluricellular hairs were intermingled on the fronds of juvenile sporophytes of all six species of Alsophila. The lacking of club-shaped pluricellular hairs on Juvenile sporophytes of S. lepifera supports the taxonomic separation of Sphaeropteris from Alsophila. The presence of 16- and 64-spored sporangia suggests two evolutionary events within Alsophila.

N2  - A detailed Karyotypic and meiotic study in three species of Chlorophytum is presented and its significance is discussed in the light of the modern concepts. Chlorophytum elatum R. Br. is tetraploid with 2n=28 chromosomes, C. heynei Baker. and C. laxum Baker. are diploids with 2n=14 or 16 chromosomes, in x=7 and 8 basic number lines and C. elatum shows asymmetrical karyotype while C. heynei and C. laxum show symmetrical karyotypes. Karyomorphological studies reveal some minor differences between the three species, such as absolute chromosomal length and relative length which clearly indicate a common origin and close relationship of these three species. However, populations of Chlorophytum elatum, C. heynei and C. laxum vary slightly in their intraspecific cytomorphological characteristics which may be the basis of ecotypic differentiation. The behaviour of chromosomes during meiosis in all the 3 species is found to be fairly normal. Nevertheless, in C. elatum quadrivalent association of chromosomes, laggards and bridges are of common occurrence. The presence of B-chromosome in C. elatum is recorded for the first time.

The two closely similar taxa, T. elevatovenosa Hayata and T. formosana Hayata, were formerly treated as separate species. However, based on our critical comparison, the typical phases of them can be separated only by the leaf shape. Therefore, T. elevatovenosa Hayata is now reduced to the rank of variety, and a new combination T. formosana var. elevatovenosa (Hayata) S. D. Shen & J. C. Wang stat. nov. is proposed here.

N2  - By using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, the composition, shape and localization of calcium depositions in the leaves of Ficus pumila L. var. awkeotsang (Makino) Comer were studied. In the mature leaves, many calcium oxalate and calcium carbonate were accumulated. All calcium carbonate depositions (cystoliths) were found in the lithocysts of the lower epidermis. The calcium oxalate crystals were in forms of druses or prismatic crystals. Most of the druses crystals were located sporadically in the cells of palisade mesophyll, while the prismatic crystals were found in the crystal cells of the bundle sheath. The formation of these two kinds of calcium deposits was related to the levels of calcium supply. The size of calcium carbonate depositions increased with the calcium concentration, but the density of lithocysts was not affected by different concentrations of calcium supply. Nevertheless, the density of calcium oxalate crystals was higher in high calcium solutions.

N2  - Five-week-old seedlings of Zinnia elegans were hydroponically cultured in Hoagland's solution containing 45μM Cd^(2+) with or without one week of prior exposure to 10μM Cd^(2+). Profiles of HPLC indicated that plants previously exposed to 10μM Cd^(2+) developed more sulfurhydryl groups and gluathione than plants not exposed to that prior treatment. Individual peaks of sulfurhydryl groups displayed a prominent increase at 24 h, following by a gradual decrease to initial levels of sulfurhydry after 96 h. Further isolation and purification of metal-binding complexes was done using DE 52, Scphadcx, and HPLC chromatographic separations. Two fractions of the LMW complex contained more than 90% of the histidine-like substance in total amino acids. The HMW complex had five peaks in the HPLC profile. One major peak contained more than 85% of the histidine-like substance, where other peaks contained less than 0.1% of the histidine, along with phytochelatins with n number 3 and 4.

N2  - A full-length cDNA encoding ipomoelin protein was isolated from an enriched cDNA library, which contained wound-inducible cDNAs subtracted from that of unwounded sweet potato. Ipomoelin gene can be induced by methyl jasmonic acid, but independent of ABA. In prior studies, the expression of ipomoelin gene was found to be inhibited by salicylic acid, and related to protein kination and phosphorylation. In this study, the deduced protein sequence of ipomoelin was compared with amino acid sequences of other proteins, and it exhibited a high homology with lectin. In order to study further the function of ipomoelin, the ipomoelin gene was constructed and transformed into a bacteria expression system. The result shows that the ipomoelin protein could be over-expressed in E.coli one hour after IPTG induction and reached a maximum four hours after induction.

N2  - We have examined fresh and macerated microspores of Selaginella kraussiana (Kze.) A. Br. using scanning electron microscopy and chemically fixed spores prepared for transmission electron microscopy. These examinations indicated that the outer spiniferous part of the microspore wall (exospore) is composed of rods that are 70 to 130 nm in diameter and it has numerous conduits of variable size, that pass through the exospore. The structural rods of the exospore are deflected around the conduits. The inner part of the exospore has radial conduits (channels) and it has the same rod-structural units as the outer part. The spines on the outer exospore increase in number and size during development and develop many branches. The outer part of the exospore is separated from the inner part of the exospore by a gap.

N2  - Yuenyang Lake is an acidic lake situated within a nature preserve in northern Taiwan. The pollen of nineteen taxa, belonging to five families, was collected from this nature preserve and investigated with light and scanning electron microscopy. The results of this investigation are supplementary work to the previous publications in this journal (Chen and Wang, 1999, 2001; Wang and Chen, 2001). A total of 4 pollen classes were identified on the basis of the aperture on the pollen wall: 3-colpate, 6-colpate, 3-colporate, and 4-7-colporate pollen. These results could be useful in the reconstruction of vegetation history around the Yuenyang Lake.

N2  - Myosotis arvensis (L.) Hill (Boraginaceae), a species native in the Europe, was naturalized recently in the northeast Taiwan. The introduction of M. arvensis adds a new element for both the genus and the species to the floristic composition of this island. Myosotis closely resembles Trigonotis, but can be easily distinguished from the latter and other genera of the Boraginaceae by having smooth and biconvex nutlets. This paper provides description of the genus and the species, line drawing, and color photos.

N2  - Historical biogeography is a study of taxa in time and space including their origin, migration and diversification. This kind of study requires fossil data and an understanding of phylogenetic relationships. These requirements make Acer a good model to study because Acer 1) has a relatively complete fossil record, 2) contains many species, 3) is a major northern temperate floristic element, and 4) is well known . Because fossils are only confidently assigned to section or species group, section as a unit is suitable for tracing evolutionary history of Acer. However, the circumscription of section of Acer is different to each classification through the long history of studies. This work reviews and summarizes the studying history of Acer. Dclendick in 1981concluded that the system of Ogata in 1967 and that of Jong in 1976 were superior to others except that most Jong's series should be raised to section. This work, therefore, follows Delendick's delineation of section except Distyla and Parviflora, which are combined as Parviflora, to elucidate the development of the circumscription of section based on the system of Pax in 1885 and 1886, Pojarkova in 1933, Momotani in 1962, Fang in 1966, Ogata in 1967.

N2  - Genetic improvement of Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh through gene introgression involving wild species of the genus using conventional methods is hampered due to the prevailing post-zygotic barriers. An in vitro technique has been used for rescuing the hybrid embryos between C. cajan and C.platycarpus, that are otherwise des tined to abort under in vivo conditions. 11 to 15 days old embryos developed into only undifferentiated callus on both MS and B5 medium supplemented with 2,4-D/IAA alone and in combination with Kinetin. On the other hand, 16-20 days old embryos could be success fully rescued on MS/B5 + 1.0 mgL^-1 IAA + 0.5 or 1.0 mgL^-1 Kinetin. Successful embryo rescue operation is largely governed by age of the explant, apart from other decisive factors like hormonal combinations and their concentrations in the culture medium.

N2  - A Himalayan species of Orchidaccae, Didiciea cunninghami is recorded from Taiwan. This plant represents the type species of genus Didiciea whose taxonomic position remains uncertain due to insufficient study of flower structure. Basing on the fresh materials collected in central Taiwan, the detailed structures of flower, especially the character of lip and pollinia are carefully observed and illustrated. It is concluded that Didiciea should be included in tribe Malaxideae of Dressler's classification system of Orchidaceae, rather than in the proposed tribe Calypsoeae. The distinction between genera Didiciea and Malaxis is also discussed and exemplified by the comparison of two native species.

In this contribution we report here the presence of three different types of morphologically intact bacteria very well preserved in amber. We could demonstrate the fine structure of the wall, the protoplasm with vacuoles, electron dense granules and flagella. This extreme form of mummification is attributed to inert dehydration and the fine structural preservation makes these ancient bacteria.

N2  - The Taiwan vascular flora is exceptionally interesting not only because it is rich and diversified, but because it is of great phytogeographic significance owing to its geographic location. The flora of Taiwan, including naturalized plants, comprises 233 families and 1389 genera with 4216 species. In terms of major growth forms, there are 588 trees, 426 shrubs, 249 lianas, 177 vines, and 2776 herbs or ferns. Approximately 234 species are exotics typically associated with pastures, road clearings and other human disturbances. An extremely large percentage of these naturalized plants are of tropical New World origin. Among the native flora, the Orchidaceae (331 species), Gramineae (249), Compositae (194), Leguminosae (176), Cyperaceae (174), Rosaceae (105), Rubiaceae (93) and Euphorbiaceae (76) rank highest in numbers of species. Clearly, the greatest part of Taiwan's floristics richness comes from a wealth of species in primarily lowland (0–600 m asl.) taxa. A total of 2571 species were recorded in the lowlands, whereas only about 251 species occur between 3100-3950 m. Endemic genera are extremely scarce in Taiwan, with only four, namely Sinopanax (Araliaceae), Hayatella (Rubiaceae), Kudoacanthus (Acanthaceae), and Haraella (Orchidaceae). In contrast to the low percentage of generic endemism, there is a remarkably higher specific endemism. About 1041 species (26.1% of indigenous plants) are known only from Taiwan. A detailed examination of these species shows that there is a distinct trend of increasing endemism with increasing altitude (r^²=0.99). A survey of indigenous non-endemic species on the basis of their geographical distribution outside Taiwan shows that they can be classified into 6 major categories: 1. pantropical and palaeotropical species (1029 species); 2. species distributed in eastern Asia, from Himalayas through southern & eastern China to Taiwan, with some extending to the Ryukyus and Japan (1075 species); 3. widespread species extending from tropical Asia to eastern Asia (232 species); 4. species distributed in Japan and the Ryukyus (189 species); 5. species distributed in temperate and subboreal regions (221 species); and 6. cosmopolitan species (72 species). The main theme of western affinity of Taiwan flora is clearly indicated by almost 52% of the total flora (2069 species) which are also represented in China. The alliances of the flora are also pronounced with the Ryukyus and southern Japan (1618 species in common). However, the close relationship between Taiwan and Japan is through their mutual relation to the lowland flora of southern and eastern China. The tropical elements, mostly ranging from Malaysia to the Philippines, are well represented in the lowlands of Taiwan and particularly in the southernmost Hengchun Peninsula and the Lanyu Island off the southeast coast of Taiwan.

N2  - Chamaecyparis obtusa Sieb. & Zucc. var. formosana (Hayata) Rehder (Taiwan yellow false cypress) is one of the most important sources of timber in Taiwan. For sustainable use of this species, basic information about its regeneration under natural conditions is required, but this has been few until now. In this paper, the composition, population structure, growing substrates, and recruitment of Taiwan yellow false cypress were studied in Yuanyang Lake Nature Researve (YYL) and nearby Szumakuszu (SMKS) area, Taiwan. Two study sites in YYL were selected for comparison: one near a lakeshore (LS) and another at a mountain ridge top (MR). A site also was studied at SMKS, located 2 km west of the lake. Within each site, all woody plants with basal diameters larger than 1 cm, and population structures were recorded and analyzed in order to elucidate the recruitment pattern of Taiwan yellow false cypress. It was documented that floristic composition and canopy structure differed among the sites. An inverse J-shaped size distribution pattern for plants growing on down logs at the LS and MR sites suggests a stable and continuous recruitment of Taiwan yellow false cypress at both YYL locations. In contrast, the Taiwan yellow false cypress at SMKS had a discontinuous size distribution, independent of inhabited substrate type. For regeneration of Taiwan yellow false cypress in SMKS, a large-scale disturbance, instead of single uprooted trees, may be necessary. The results indicate that down log is important substrate for regeneration of Taiwan yellow false cypress, particularly in forests at the YYL, LS and MR. Based on the findings in YYL, some down logs are suggested to leave in clear cutting plantation, because they might provide suitable space for regeneration of Taiwan yellow false cypress. This suggestion is expected to reduce the cost and work frequency of management.

N2  - Microtrichomanes digitatum (Sw.) Copel., a filmy fern species, was discovered in the southern Taiwan during the botanical inventory of past decade. It represents a new record for the fern flora of Taiwan. Microtrichomanes digitatum can be distinguished from its congener, M. nitidulum (v. d. Bosch) Copel., in bearing short, stiff, simple, and dark-brown setae on the leaf margins. The present study provides taxonomic description, photographs, and a distribution map. The problems of taxonomy, ecology, conservation, distribution and phytogeography are also discussed.

N2  - Coccolithophorids in the northeastern and central South China Sea (SCS) were surveyed in March and October 1996. The cell density of coccolithophorids ranged from 25 x 10^3 cells L^(-1) to 31 x 10^3 cells L^(-1) in sea-surface water (0–25 m in depth), and from 12 x 10^3 cells L^(-1) to 62 x 10^3 cells L^(-1) in subsurface water (150 m in depth). The lowest cell number was recorded in the subsurface (150 m in depth) in the central gyral area, while the highest one was at the same depth in the northeastern realm. A total of thirty-one species were identified. The species richness in the northeastern SCS is higher than in the central area. Emiliania huxleyi (Lohmann) Hay et Mohler, Gephyrocapsa oceanica Kamptner, Umbellosphaera Paasche spp. and Syracosphaera Lohmann spp. dominated the surface assemblages, whereas Florisphaera profunda Okada et Honjo, Gladiolithus flabellatus (Halldal et Markali) Jordan et Chamberlain predominated in the subsurface layer. In contrast, Palusphaera vandeli Lecal emend. R. E. Norris presented in both surface and subsurface assemblages.

N2  - Forty-nine species of Taiwan Pteridaceae were examined for their leaf epidermal features. Some of these features are stable characters without location variation, and are very good in differentiating taxa, especially at generic level. All genera except Cheilanthes were supported by the present study data. Taiwan Cheilanthes may be better divided into four genera. Leaf epidermal features are also provide some clues of systematic relationships among several genera. Coniogramme and Pteris may be more close to each other than previously thought.

N2  - Laportea, comprising ca. 22 species, is a genus of the Urticaceae. Two species were previously recorded in the 2nd edition of Flora of Taiwan. In the course of our botanical inventory, one additional weedy species, namely Laportea aestuans (L.) Chew, was found in the central Taiwan. Morphologically, L. aestuans is closely related to L. interrupta (L.) Chew by sharing ovate leaves. Branched racemes of L. aestuans are distinct from the unbranched racemes of L. interrupta. Laportea aestuans is a species mainly distributed at low elevations in central Taiwan.

N2  - There are hundreds of exospore units that extend across the gap and into the mesospore in middle stages in megaspores of Selaginella pulcherrima Liebm.ex Fourn and S. haematodes (Kunze) Spring. The mesospore of these megaspores is resistant to acetolysis during middle stages suggesting the presence of sporopollenin. There are also spheroidal structures that are resistant to acetolysis on the surfaces of the outer and inner exospore in both species in middle and mature stages. In late stages the mesospore no longer exists and the inner exospore is a narrow stripe, i.e., there is no longer a space (gap) between outer and inner parts of the exospore. Our interpretation for the loss of the mesospore is that sporopollenin does not become polymerized under physiological conditions to its exceptional state of resistance to reduction, but does so when exposed to native or experimental oxidation; in our case, exposure to the atmosphere by cutting open the megaspore and plunging it into the acetolysis mixture.

N2  - A rapid micropropagation system was developed for Ceropegia bulbosa Roxb. var. bulbosa. First five nodes of ~ 1.0 cm each, harvested from young healthy shoots from garden raised plants were cultured on B5 medium supplemented with different concentrations of BA and AdS each in combination with 0.05 mg/L NAA. Multiple shoot formation of upto 12 shoots was observed within one week in presence of BAP (3 mg/L) and NAA (0.05 mg/L). Shoots were multiplied by subculture on the same medium. Shoots of 3-4 cm length were rooted in medium supplemented with 2 mg/L IBA. The rooted plantlets were hardened and successfully established in pots at 70% success rate. In vitro flowering was observed at 0.5 mg/L BA+1 mg/L GA3. Shoots transferred to the medium containing kinetin (0.05 mg/L) + IBA (2 mg/L) showed microtubers in 28 days while the shoots cultured in presence of 1 mg/L GA3 +0.5 mg/L of BA showed 76% flowering leading to seed production and 65% of the seeds germinated in successive generations.

N2  - The first collection of Quercus aliena Blume var. acutiserrata Maxim. ex Wenz. in Taiwan was made by Y. Shimada in 1924 from Hongmao. Since then, no other specimen had ever been collected. Recently, this species was rediscovered from Fengshan (3 km south of Hongmao) in Hsinchu County. On closer studies it was found to be the typical variety of Q. aliena Blume rather than the name recognized by Shimada. The population of Q. aliena is quite small at that limited location, and is vulnerable to human impacts. Therefore, it is necessary to take steps to conserve the habitat as soon as possible. The taxonomic treatment, morphological descriptions, photographs and notes of the species are given here. A key to distinguish it from the other three closely related Taiwanese species is also provided.

N2  - Pollen wall development of Illicium floridanum and Schisandra chinensis have been studied and compared. Both species have a similar reticulate exine, but their similarity occured to be only superficial. At early tetrad stage of both species the plasma membrane acquires a regularly invaginative profile, the distribution pattern of invaginations on the microspore surface corresponds to the future reticulate exine pattern. In the invaginative sites of the plasma membrane of both species fibrillar strands appear which are the auxiliary (phantom) structures. Further developmental process is different in both species. In Illicium sporopollenin accumulates around the auxiliary strands, localized in plasma membrane invaginations, resulting in the appearance of the reticulate sculpture of hollow tunnels on the surface of a microspore; this reticulate pattern becomes concave after lifting of the invaginated portions of the plasma membrane. In Schisandra, on the contrary, sporopollenin never accumulates in the location of the auxiliary fibrillar strands (these are sites of future lumina), but sporopollenin accumulations concentrate on the elements of the glycocalyx on the evaginated top (protruding sites) of plasma membrane. The latter are sites for columellae formation, and muri are constructed from the rows of columallae covered by tectum. Hence, the development of the exine in both species is different, and the inner structure of reticulate exine in Illicium differs from that of Schisandra-in spite of the very similar sculpture.

N2  - The diurnal variation of airborne pollen and spores in Taipei City, Taiwan, was investigated during a two-year survey from 1993 to 1994. The pollen and spores were sampled using a Burkard seven-day volumetric pollen trap. The diurnal trends of the total amount of pollen and spores in 1993 and in 1994 were similar to each other, and peaked at 3 to 10 o’clock. The diurnal patterns of airborne pollen and spores of Broussonetia, Fraxinus, Cyathea and Gramineae in 1993 were similar to those in 1994. High concentrations of Broussonetia and Fraxinus were obtained from midnight to the next morning. Cyathea spores peaked from morning till noon, and Gramineae peaked in the afternoon. The diurnal patterns of airborne pollen of Bischofia, Juniperus, Mallotus, Morus, Trema and Urticaceae in 1993 were different to those in 1994. Regular diurnal patterns also associated with the taxa, which produce large pollen or spores, such as Gramineae and Cyathea. In contrast, Bischofia, Juniperus, Mallotus, Morus, Trema and Urticaceae produce relatively small pollen and the diurnal patterns of their airborne pollen were found irregular. The source plants Broussonetia and Fraxinus were close to the collection site so the diurnal patterns of their airborne pollen were regular, suggesting that the diurnal fluctuations of the pollen or spores in air might be affected by the source of plants and the sizes of pollen or spores. The transportation of the smaller pollen or spores in air is probably more easily affected by instability of air currents; they are therefore more likely to exhibit irregular diurnal patterns.

N2  - The genus Calamus in the Arecaceae has so far remained embryologically unknown. The present work on the development of the microsporangium and male gametophyte in 5 species of Calamus (Arecaceae) is the first investigation. The tapetum is of secretory type and its cells become binucleate. The pollen mother cells undergo successive divisions to produce isobilateral and tetrahedral tetrads. The mature pollen grains in C. nagbettai, C. stoloniferus and C. travancoricus are 2-celled at the time of shedding. In C. gamblei and C. rotang they are, however, 3-celled when shed.

N2  - An investigation of the mycoflora in northern Taiwan from August 1999 to June 2000, particularly of thermophilic and thermotolerant fungi inhabiting sulfurous hot spring soils, resulted in identification 12 taxa: Aspergillus fumigatus var. fumigatus (66.85%), A. fumigatus var. 1 with green colony (7.86%), A. fumigatus var. 2 with brown colony (4.81%), A. niger (1.14%), unidentified Asperigillus sp. (0.045%), Chrysosporium sp. (0.18%), Papulaspora thermophila (2.72%), Scytalidium thermophilum (0.045%), Sporotrichum sp. (0.045%), Mycelia sterilia sp.1 with white colony (6.63%), Mycelia sterilia sp.2 with yellow colony (5.27%) and Mycelia sterilia sp. 3 with gray colony (4.405%). A total of 2202 colonies were isolated from three sampling sites: site 1 (hot springhead), site 2 (2 m from site 1) and site 3 (4 m from site 1). Fungal colonies isolated as well as species percentage at three sites were as follows: 32.92% in 9 taxa from site 1, 37.87% in 11 taxa from site 2, and 29.21% in 8 taxa from site 3. The dominant species was Aspergillus fumigatus var. fumigatus, which was isolated year around from three sampling sites. A. fumigatus var. 1 appeared from February to June 2000. A. fumigatus var. 2 was isolated only in August and October 1999. Within the sampling range of hot spring niches, there was evidence of the presence of ecotypes in the A. fumigatus complex. Chrysosporium sp. and Sporotrichum sp. were isolated only from the soils without hot water treatment, but Aspergillus sp. and Scytalidium thermophilum were isolated only from the soils pre-treated with hot water for 30 min. at 60℃. The significance level (P value) of fungal communities between hot water treatment and no treatment was 0.866, indicating that no significant difference between both treatments.

N2  - The morphology of stipules and leaves of Kandelia candel (L.) Druce and K. obovata Sheue, Liu & Yong were studied and compared. The discrepancies of anatomical features, including stomata location, stomata type, cuticular ridges of stomata, cork warts and leaf structures, among previous literatures are clarified. Stipules have abaxial collenchyma but without sclereid ideoblast. Colleters, finger-like rod with a stalk, aggregate into a triangular shape inside the base of the stipule. Cork warts may sporadically appear on both leaf surfaces. In addition, obvolute vernation of leaves, the pattern of leaf scar and the difference of vein angles of these two species are reported.

N2  - In this study we used Box's model, which is based on the equilibrium relationships between macroclimate and plant forms, to assess the possible impacts of climate change on the potential tree plant forms of a mountain region in central Taiwan. To account for the effects of uncertainty associated with the projected climatic conditions on the model's predictions, a Monte Carlo study was also carried out. For the temperature variables in the model, they varied between 0 and 5°C above the long-term average; for the precipitation related variables, the projected precipitation varied between ±30% of the long-term average. The responses of tree plant forms to temperature increases could be divided into three categories: (1) those that would not be influenced, (2) those that could disappear gradually, including summergreen tree species, which are more sensitive to temperature and require a lower temperature to exist, and (3) those that could appear gradually, including tropical tree species. Under the projected precipitation conditions, most of the tree plant forms currently present would not be influenced, except for rainforest and raingreen tree plant forms. The necessary data for Box's model could be obtained easily from usual climatic databases, and the results have a higher resolution than Holdridge Life Zone model. When detailed information necessary to run high-resolution models is not available, the approach used in this study could be used as an alternative.

N2  - This paper is intended for elucidation the anther and pollen wall development of Dumasia miaoliensis Liu and Lu (Fabaceae). The undifferentiated anther is ovoid-shaped and tetrasporangiated. The anther wall development is basic type, which is composed of an epidermal layer, an endothecial layer, two middle layers and tapetum. Anther-tapetum is glandular type and its' cells are uniseriate and uninucleate. Pollen grains are 6-porate and 2-celled at the time of shedding. Before protectum development, a glycocalyx layer is deposited on the invaginated plasma membrane, exclusive of the future apertures. Subsequently, the probacules, arising basally from the plasma membrane, elongate under the protectum. The foot layer and endexine formation are concomitant with the callosic wall dissolution. The foot layer is thin and interrupted, but the endexine is thick and continuous. The intine is initiated in the vacuolated stage.

N2  - Seed morphology and germination patterns of 17 halophytes belonging to 10 families of Sundarbans, India, were studied in view of their dispersal, rehabilitation and taxonomic interest. Fruits are mostly one seeded in the investigated taxa, except in Acanthus ilicifolius, Excoecaria agallocha, Sonneratia apetala and Xylocarpus spp. Seeds are inseparable from fruits in Aegialitis rotundifolia, Aegiceras corniculatum, Avicennia spp., Nypa fruticans and the investigated species of Rhizophoraceae. Propagules are mostly dispersed by tidal water. They have to float for some distance prior to establishment for a gradual adjustment of the young ones towards the saline environment. Viviparous germination occurs in all members of Rhizophoraceae, where seed germination takes place immediately after fertilization without any dormancy period. In this case the long hypocotyl comes out of the seed and ultimately from the fruit when the fruit is still attached with the mother plant. This phenomenon is considered as the most complex and highly evolved phenomenon in evolutionary line. In Aegialitis rotundifolia, Aegiceras corniculatum, Avicennia spp. and Nypa fruticans, germination occurs following an incipiently viviparous type where the hypocotyl pierces out of the seed coat but not from the exocarp at the time of dispersal. This incident should be defined more appropriately as cryptovivipary. On the basis of seed characters, an identification key was generated for easy identification of the dispersing units.

N2  - The present study describes a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detection of Herpesvirus anguillae (HVA) DNA. PCR primers (622F and 622R) were developed based on a HindIII-1550 bp DNA fragment from HVA genomic library. Templates of HVA DNA yielded an evident amplification product showing the expected mobility of a 622-bp DNA fragment. The assay is rapid, sensitive and specifically detects HVA DNA including both the Taiwanese and the Japanese isolates. HVA persistent infections in asymptomatic farmed eels at Taiwan were revealed successfully in the present study.

N2  - A computer-based video analysis system has been developed for measuring the stroke volume and the heart rate of the insect. A quantitative evaluation of the effects of octopamine (OA) on the heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output of Periplaneta americana, the American cockroach, was also studied. The heart rate of OA-treated cockroach significantly increased within 2 minutes, compared to that of the control groups. On the other hand, the stroke volumes of OA-treated cockroaches decreased within 2 minutes (p ＜ 0.05). Furthermore, OA elicited the heart rate and the stroke volume with a dose- dependent response. Although OA increased heart rate and decreased stroke volume in the cockroach, it decreased cardiac output (mL/min) calculated based on heart rate (beats/min) and stroke volume (mL/beat).

N2  - This study was conducted in years 2000 to 2003 to compile a comprehensive list of naturalized species with background information, including origins, life forms, habits, usages, year of the first collection, and status. Major herbaria (TAI, HAST, TAIF, and NCKU) were visited to examine specimen records. Relevant publications and reliable websites and many other resources were also examined extensively for background information. Total 341 species in 222 genera and 60 families were documented as naturalized in Taiwan, representing 7.9% of the local flora. Besides, 25 species were considered as possibly naturalized due to insufficient evidences. A large portion (90.6%) of species reported here, were reported as ”weeds” in other countries. Almost a half of the naturalized species (48.3%) were introduced from Americas.

N2  - The vegetation composition of Yuanyang Lake (YYL), a subalpine natural preserve in Taiwan, could be divided into two major communities, the coniferous-hardwood and the swamp communities. Nutrient contents of N, P, K and Mg in mature and senescent leaves of Chamaecyparis obtuse var. formosana and Rhododendron formosanum, dominating the coniferous-hardwood community, Sparganium fallax, Schoenoplectus mucronatus subsp. robustus, and Miscanthus transmorrisonensis, the swamp community, were measured in April, July and October of 2002 and January of 2003. The objectives of this study were to compare the seasonal changes in nutrient contents of leaves among the five species and to determine the extent of nutrient loss in these species prior to leaf fall. In general, mature leaves of marsh plants had higher N, P and K contents than those of the two terrestrial plants. Among the nutrients measured, only Mg contents showed consistently seasonal trend. Mature and senescent leaves of the five species had consistently higher Mg contents in April than those collected in other seasons. In comparison between mature and senescent leaves, senescent leaves always had significantly lower N, P, and K contents than mature leaves, indicating loss of these nutrients from aging leaves. Potassium was the greatest among the nutrients lost. In comparison between terrestrial and marsh plants, senescent leaves of marsh plants lost significantly more P than those of the two terrestrial plants.

N2  - In vitro regeneration protocol was developed for multiplication of Cryptolepis buchanani by using shoot tip, cotyledonary node and nodal explants derived from seedlings grown in vitro. The best response was achieved with nodal explants. Cultures were established placing the nodal explants on Murashige and Skoog's (MS; 1962) medium supplemented with various cytokinins singly or in combination with auxin and gibberellin. Of the various cytokinins used singly or in combination with auxins, 6-Benzyl aminopurine (BAP) was found to be most effective for shoot proliferation. The maximum number of shoots (12.5 to 13.0 shoots / explant with a shoot length of 4.5 to 5.0 cm) were produced on MS medium fortified with BAP 2mg/L, Kinetin (KN) 0.1mg/L, Napthalene acetic acid (NAA) 0.05 mg/L and gibberellic acid (GA3) 0.05 mg/L with 60% response. Individual shoots (grown on shoot proliferation medium) were rooted on MS medium supplemented with various auxins－Indole acetic acid (IAA), Indole butyric acid (IBA), NAA-singly or in combination. Of these IBA 1 mg/L resulted in higher number of microshoots (80%) to form roots (about 6.5 to 7.0 roots / shoot and the root length of 4.0 to 4.5 cm). The in vitro raised plantlets were acclimatized successfully to pots containing a mixture of autoclaved peatmoss and compost in 1:1 ratio.

N2  - Seed morphometry and Scanning Electron Microscopic studies on 10 species of epiphytic orchids from Western ghats of Karnataka are presented. All the presently investigated taxa are different in their seed surface characters including size, shape, visibility of embryo, testa cells and structure, curvature and ridges. Seed colours range from pale yellow to yellow, brown and white. Variation between maximum and minimum in the length/width ratio of seed is discussed. Data on the seed volume show that higher seed volume is the result of both greater length and width. Maximum width of testa cell and seed volume are found in Cymbidium bicolor. Variations in seed and embryo volume and percent air space could exist among the different taxa of orchids. The volume of the embryo changes during its developments from zygote to seedling. Increase in the percentage of air space is due to increase in the cell length of the testa. Seeds with higher percentage of air space get dispersed over wide geographical areas.

N2  - Habitat use was investigated for two common endemic and benthic fishes, Crossostoma lacustre and Rhinogobius candidianus, in the Hapen Creek of northern Taiwan from August 1996 to December 1998. C. lacustre and R. candidianus overlapped in mesohabitat use; both fish species preferred riffles to pools. Further analyses based on stepwise multiple regression showed that fish density was significantly correlated with water depth, small boulder, and finer substrate for C. lacustre, but correlated with water depth, stream width, large boulder, and cobble for R. candidianus. The separation in the microhabitat use might have alleviated the pressure for interspecific competitions despite of their overlapping in the mesohabitat scale. Parallelly, the result suggests that the diverse substratum composition may have accounted for the co-exsitence of these two benthic fishes. It would also provide valuable information for habitat management and ecological engineering of mountain creeks in Taiwan.

N2  - An in vitro protocol was developed for rapid multiplication of plantlets via direct organogenesis from the leaf segments of Embelia ribes Burm. (Myrsinaceae), a rare woody medicinal shrub under threat of being extinct. Adventitious shoots were organized directly from the margin of the lamina on medium supplemented with 2 to 4 mg/L 6-furfuryl amino purine (FAP) and 0.2 to 0.6 mg/L naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). The frequency of shoot bud production was the highest (mean of 33.6 ± 3.63 shoots per explants) at the concentration of 3 mg/L FAP and 0.4 mg/L NAA. Rooting of microshoots was also noticed on the same medium in a single-phase culture. A mean of 30 ± 1.05 root intact plantlets was recovered per explant. The rooted plantlets were well accomplished with a survival frequency of 96%. Moreover, there were no phenotypic differences observed between the in vitro regenerated and in vivo plants.

N2  - Camellia buisanensis Sasaki was first described in 1931. Unfortunately, the type specimen had been lost since its first discovery and there were no relevant materials for re-examination. Therefore, its identity is dubious. This long lost tea species was rediscovered this year at Mt. Jenlishan in southern Taiwan. However, after careful comparison, C. buisanensis is morphologically much more similar to the genus Pyrenaria than to Camellia. Consequently the species is treated as a new combination as Pyrenaria buisanensis (Sasaki) C. F. Hsieh, S. Z. Yang and M. H. Su. Besides taxonomic treatment, historical status of this species is provided here. A key to Taiwanese Pyrenaria and a line-drawing are also provided. Due to its endangered status, extraordinary restoration efforts are urgently needed to save this species.

N2  - To explore the inorganic carbon utilization of the freshwater red alga Compsopogon coeruleus, photosynthetic rates in response to increasing of bicarbonate concentration, the addition of alkaline HEPES buffer (pH 8.8), acid HEPES buffer (pH 4.0) and the extracellular carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide, AZ), respectively, were examined in situ by using a submersible pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometer. Among the treatments, adding acid HEPES buffer significantly reduced photosynthetic rates of the alga, while others showed no effect. Accordingly, we concluded that C. coeruleus had less or no inorganic carbon (Ci) limitation in its natural habitat. The alga might have higher affinity for bicarbonate and directly uptake bicarbonate as main Ci source without the aid of extracellular carbonic anhydrase.

N2  - During seed germination of Justicia procumbens, the formation of lithocysts, trichomes and diacytic stomata in the epidermis of cotyledons was following a specific distribution pattern. During the first 1-3 days, many young stomata and trichome initial cells were formed sporadically in the adaxial and abaxial epidermis, but no lithocyst was found. Three to five days after seed sawing, two cotyledons were exposed to light and then opened. In the meantime, some lithocysts were recognized on both adaxial and abaxial epidermises. The lithocysts on the adaxial epidermis occurred in the radially arranged cells located between the central area and the margin. However on the abaxial epidermis, they were found only in the marginal cell layer and their axes were along the margin of cotyledons. The total number of lithocysts in a cotyledon at this stage was 32.2±4.3 and the cystolith inside the lithocyst was spindle in shape and 48.2±21.1 μm in length. Three weeks after seed sowing, the cotyledons were mature and the total number of lithocysts in a cotyledon was 112.2±10.1 and the cystolith in the lithocyst was enlarged to be 119.8±27.8 μm in length. The cystolith was extracellularly formed in the cell wall of lithocyst. Its surface was with many protuberances and surrounded by a cystolith sheath connecting to cytoplasmic strands. The core of cystolith was surrounded by concentrically stratified fibrils and the calcium carbonate was concentrically accumulated. The waved stratified fibrils were also deposited in the protuberances. The EDX spectra showed that the main mineral elemental compositions of cystoliths were Ca and P. Ca was deposited more in the central part of cystolith than in the marginal area.

N2  - For species of Triticeae, e.g., barley, β-amylase was synthesized in endosperm during seed development and processed to active form during seed germination. Thus, β-amylase was suggested to be one of the enzymes to degrade endosperm starch for seed germination. β-Amylase expression in maize kernels apparently is different from that of barley. By immunolocalization, we found that maize β-amylase is expressed in the pericarp but not in the endosperm during seed development; and is synthesized in the aleurone cells but not in the scutellar epithelium cells during seed germination. The newly synthesized maize β-amylase is retained inside of the aleurone cells. On the contrary, maize α-amylase is synthesized and secreted from the aleurone cells to the starchy endosperm. By PAS and iodine stain, we showed that starch is present in the starchy endosperm and absent in the aleurone cells of maize seeds. Results of starch film assay and native activity gel analysis indicated that α-amylases are the enzymes for endosperm starch degradation during maize seed germination. Because maize β-amylase is synthesized and retained in the aleurone cells, it is unlikely that β-amylase acts on endosperm starch during seed germination.

N2  - The introns of chloroplast trnK^UUU belong to Group II introns and contain an open reading frame denoted as matK. The trnK^5'-matK-trnK^3' structure is consistent in almost all examined higher land plants and in Characeae, but not in other green algae examined. The putative gene product MatK is the only maturase in chloroplasts. Functional chloroplast matK genes are retained even in the nonphotosynthetic parasite, Epifagus virginiana and the fern, Adiantum capillus-veneris, in which chloroplast genome rearrangement has left matK free-standing, apart from trnK exons. Among lower land plants, the chloroplasts of Psilotum, mosses and liverworts all have trnK^5'-matK-trnK^3' structure, but matK is a pseudogene in hornwort Anthoceros formosae. In this study we found a clear trnK^5'-matK-trnK^3' structure in Ophioglossum petiolatum, Lycopodiella cernua and Selaginella doederleinii, but PCR with degenerate primers failed to amplify any trnK or matK fragments from other ferns and fern allies. However, dot blot hybridization showed distinct signals in these plants that failed to amplify matK fragments by PCR, indicating that the matK sequences in those taxa may be too divergent to amplify by an ordinary PCR approach. RT-PCR results showed matK genes are expressed in Ophioglossum petiolatum and Lycopodiella cernua, but no signal was detected in Selaginella doederleinii. Overall, the expression patterns of matK are not consistent in lower land plants. Phylogenetic analysis of matK sequence showed that Pinus, Ginkgo, and Cycas form a monophyletic group, which is sister to angiosperms. Together, they form a clade that is sister to Gnetales. This ad hoc reconstruction is likely due to the high evolutionary rate in matK.

N2  - Naturalization has been shown to be one of the primary stages of plant invasions; therefore, studies on naturalized plant species may generate valuable insights of possible invaders and invasions. Background information of casual and naturalized Asteraceae species provided by a comprehensive list of casual and naturalized species in Taiwan was examined to estimate the basic biological traits and geological origins of potential invasive species in this study. Besides, herbarium records were collected and analyzed to predict the invasiveness of casual and naturalized Asteraceae species. Our results showed that 44.0% out of the 51 casual and naturalized Asteraceae species were classified as invasive in the field, and a notable portion of these species were probably introduced accidently. Tropical Americas were the most important origins of casual and naturalized Asteraceae species, followed by Europe and temperate Americas. Most of the casual and naturalized Asteraceae species were annual herbs, and a few perennial species categorized as invasive may cause profound environmental problems. The herbarium record showed that species possessed different numbers of localities within the same time frame. We suggested that casual and naturalized Asteraceae species collected in more localities are more invasive than those species found in fewer localities within the same period of time.

N2  - In the present investigation, the occurrence of phloem and callose deposition on sieve plates in the haustorium of Aeginetia pedunculata Wall, a root holoparasitic herb of Orobanchaceae, is demonstrated. Our studies reveal that the haustorium of A. pedunculata has highly specialized phloem tissue, comprising of sieve tube elements and companion cells found associated occasionally with the xylem strands. More often, they are found as isolated strands in the lobes of the endophyte and the cortex of parasite root. Distinct sieve tube strands can be traced from the parasite root vasculature up to the region of the entry of the haustorium cells into the host stele. The sieve elements show the normal pattern of callose deposition. The callose deposited around the sieve pores show positive staining to lacmoid blue and fluorescence was observed, confirming their phloic nature.

N2  - During the first author's visit to Taiwan in 2002 he checked many fern specimens at several herbaria, i.e. HAST, TAI, TAIF and TNM and found several new taxa, including 6 new records; Pteris dissitifolia Baker, Dryopteris huangshanensis Ching, Dryopteris latibasis Ching, Dryopteris redactopinnata S. K. Basu & Panigr., Microsorium carinatum (W. M. Chu & Z. R. He) S. G. Lu and Polypodiodes chinensis (H. Christ) S. G. Lu and 2 new combinations for Taiwan (Microsorium carinatum (W. M. Chu & Z. R. He) S. G. Lu, and Polypodiodes raishanensis (Rosenst.) S. G. Lu). The description and voucher specimens only for the newly recorded species have been accepted in the present work. Based on the Flora Reipublicae Popularis Sinicae vols. 2-6, there are about 2,600 species of ferns in China. Because different fern arrangement systems are used in Taiwan and Mainland China, lots of different scientific names are applied to the same taxon. The arrangement of families in the present work follows Ching's system (1978) instead of that in the Flora of Taiwan 2nd ed. Including those newly recorded spesies there are 57 families, 184 genera and 677 species/taxa (including infraspecific taxa) presented in the present work.

N2  - The forest structure and woody species composition were investigated in a montane rainforest of Mt. Lopei in northern Taiwan. All stems ≥ 1 cm dbh were measured and identified for a permanent plot of 1-ha (1,136 to 1,164 m asl.). Approximately 12,934 stems of 70 taxa in 31 families were found. The most abundant families were Fagaceae, Illiciaceae, and Theaceae, representing 51.5% of the individuals. The dominant species, based on basal areas were Cyclobalanopsis longinux, Machilus thunbergii, Cyclobalanopsis sessilifolia, Illicium arborescens, Diospyros morrisiana, and Meliosma seqimulata. Comparison of TWINSPAN groupings with the DCA ordination showed a definitive separation of forest types along a topographic gradient. The categorized forest types were the Cyclobalanopsis longinux-Myrsine seguinii type on the ridgetop and northeastern slope facing strong northeastern monsoon, and the Illicium arborescens-Itea parviflora type on the relatively protected southwestern slope. Evident differences of the composition and structure were observed between these two forest types. Size-class structures of most species showed an inverse J-shaped or an inverse L-shaped distribution, both indicators of a continuous recruitment in this permanent plot.

N2  - A permanent 2.21 ha plot of lowland subtropical rainforest was established at Nanjen Lake of the Nanjenshan Nature Reserve in southern Taiwan. All free-standing woody plants in the plot with DBH ≥ 1 cm were identified, measured, tagged, and mapped. A total of 120 tree species (21,592 stems), belonging to 44 families and 83 genera, was recorded. The community structure was characterized by a relative dominance of Castanopsis carlesii in the canopy, Illicium arborescens in the subcanopy, and Psychotria rubra in the understory. The dominant families were Fagaceae, Illiciaceae, Aquifoliaceae, Lauraceae and Theaceae. However, typical species of lowland area in Taiwan, such as members of Euphorbiaceae and Moraceae, were relatively rare. Thus, floristic composition of this area was comparable with that found in some of the subtropical rain forests or even warm-temperate rain forests of the Central Range in Taiwan. The analysis of size-class distributions of individual species showed good recruitment patterns with a rich sapling bank for each species. TWINSPAN analysis revealed four distinct groups of samples, with the ridge top and northwest streamside plant communities representing two opposite extremes of the gradient. The dominant families of the ridge group were Fagaceae, Illiciaceae, Theaceae, Aquifoliaceae and Lauraceae, whereas those dominating the streamside group were Rubiaceae, Araliceae, Lauraceae, Fagaceae, and Staphyleaceae. Most species had a patchy distribution and many were distributed randomly. Among those with a patchy distribution, Cyclobalanopsis championii and Rhododendron simsii only occurred on the ridge top, while Drypetes karapinensis and Ficus fistulosa occurred along the streamside. Illicium arborescens and Ilex cochinchinensis were commonly distributed on the intermediate slope. Species that appeared to be randomly or near-randomly distributed over the plot included Schefflera octophylla and Daphniphyllum glaucescens ssp. oldhamii. The distribution patterns of species also suggested that there was strong niche differentiation among species. It is found that the community of Nanjenshan forest is organized by different topographic plant associations. Maintenance of tree species diversity in the forests is largely due to differentiated environmental factors related to plot topography.

N2  - Principal components analysis (PCA) was employed to analyse the morphological variation among 63 herbarium specimens tentatively identified as Pomatocalpa andamanicum (Hook.f.) J. J. Sm., P. koordersii (Rolfe) J. J. Sm., P. latifolium (Lindl.) J. J. Sm., P. linearifolium Seidenf., P. maculosum (Lindl.) J. J. Sm., P. marsupiale (Kraenzl.) J. J.Sm., P. naevatum J. J. Sm., or P. siamense (Rolfe ex Downie) Summerh. Thirty-seven quantitative and 5 binary characters were included in the analyses. Taxa were delimited according to the observed clustering of specimens in the PCA plots, diagnostic characters were identified, and the correct nomenclature was established through examination of type material. Four species could be recognized viz, P. diffusum Breda (syn. P. latifolium), P. fuscum (Lindl.) J. J. Sm. (syn. P. latifolium), P. marsupiale (syn. P. koordersii) and P. maculosum. For the latter species, two subspecies could be recognized, viz P. maculosum (Lindl.) J. J. Sm. subsp. maculosum (syn. P. maculosum, P. naevatum p.p.) and P. maculosum (Lindl.) J. J. Sm. subsp. andamanicum (Hook.f.) S. Watthana (syn. P. andamanicum, P. linearifolium, P. siamense, P. naevatum p.p.). An identification key and a taxonomic synopsis are provided.

N2  - Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) are two bioactive lysophospholipids (LPLs), stored primarily in platelets and released during platelet activation. Both LPLs are capable of regulating endothelial cell functions. The physiological functions of S1P and LPA are mediated by interacting with eight different G-protein coupled receptors: S1P1 through 5 and LPA1 through 3, which activate three different heterotrimeric GTP proteins-including Gi、Gq and G(12/13). The expression of LPL receptors in endothelial cells would affect the responses of S1P and LPA to these cells. There is no previous report discussing the expression profiles of LPL receptors in different endothelial cells from various species. In this study, we aim to investigate the expression profiles of S1P and LPA receptors in different endothelial cells isolated from human, rat, mouse and bovine origin. We used RT-PCR to determine LPLs receptors expression profiles in different endothelial cells. Our results indicated that endothelial cells from various species express different LPL receptors. Endothelial cells isolated from the same source of different species also had different LPLs receptors expression profiles. Therefore, different endothelial cells should respond to LPLs in different manners.

N2  - Nested clade phylogeographical analysis (NCPA), developed by A. R. Templeton and his colleague, was used to infer the evolutionary events that shaped the spatial genetic structure of Trochodendron aralioides in Taiwan. Genetic variation of two intergenic spacers of chloroplast DNA (petG-trnP and trnA-psbJ) among 24 populations, in which two from Japan, two from the Ryukyus and 20 from Taiwan, was examined. The NCPA suggests that the populations in Taiwan were first isolated from those of Japan proper. Since then, the spatial genetic structure in Taiwan was attributable to restricted gene flow.

A host fish was easily identified by the presence of an external orifice at the base of the right pectoral fin. A pair of I. fushanensis were found in the body cavity of the host. Therefore, the present finding suggests that the infestation of I. fushanensis is likely no longer specific to Varicorhinus barbatulus.

N2  - In this paper, we examined the breeding bird species richness along an elevational gradient in northern Taiwan. These data obtained from 144 sites were used to test the mid-domain model. We compared the species richness with expectations from the mid-domain models, and identified elevational ranges at which the species richness was excessive or depauperate in species, relative to expectations. In addition, we compared the observed spatial distributions of geographic ranges with those predicted by mid-domain models to explore how species richness deviations were produced. Along the entire elevational gradient, observed species richness in most sites obviously deviated from those predicted by mid-domain models. We hypothesize that asymmetrical hump-shaped curve of the species richness may come from the combination of the favorableness hypothesis, the productivity hypothesis, and the mid-domain effect. Comparisons between observed and predicted spatial distributions of geographic ranges indicated that the nonrandomness of the distributions of endpoints or midpoints was highly congruent with vegetation transitions along the elevational gradient. The time hypothesis may account for the nonrandomness below 500m.

Those of O. jaburan collected from three major islands (Amami-oshima, Tokuno-shima and Okinawa-jima) of the central Ryukyus were also investigated for comparison. All plants of O. reversus and O. jaburan investigated were diploid (2n=36) based on the basic chromosome number of x=18. Among 36 chromosomes of O. reversus, one pair of short chromosomes with submedian centromeres had secondary constrictions at the proximal region of the long arms. Based on this character, O. reversus is cytologically distinguishable from O. jaburan, in which one pair of short metacentric chromosomes had secondary constrictions at the proximal region of the short arms.

N2  - Collection and identification of pollen is becoming important in forensic applications. Many criminal cases have been reported to link suspects to the crime scene by analysis of pollen. Several methods have been used in the pollen collection and analysis, but they are expensive and tedious. Therefore, it is important to develop a simple method to collect pollen grains from clothes. We tried to recover pollen from clothing surface by using the sticky tapes method. The tape adhesive method has been widely used for sample collection for various purposes, but the efficiency of recovery of invisible pollen from clothes has rarely been reported. Therefore, to test the efficiency of the tape adhesive method in recovering pollen from clothes is important. The first author wore clothes that were made from textile S made by the mixture of cotton 60% and polyester fiber 40% to collect pollen from 26 different areas mostly in the northern part of Taiwan and then used cellophane tape D (Sirchie Finger Print Lab., Inc-No. 131LT4) to recover them from different body parts. Twenty-six pollen taxa were detected in different parts of clothes depending upon what kind of plant the first author stayed near. From the results, we concluded that the tape adhesive method is suitable in recovering pollen from clothes. We have suggested that the tape adhesive method could be part of methods for collecting pollen from clothes of suspects. It is simpler, faster and less expensive than other methods.

N2  - The intricate process of spermatogenesis in the paradise fish, Macropodus opercularis, was studied. In this species, the unrestricted or lobular type testes lining the caudal side of the body cavity are translucent and slender. Spermatogonia occur along the length of the tubules and the development of sperm takes place within cysts formed by Sertoli cells. Spermiogenesis involves preparatory morphological events followed by conspicuous modifications such as the movement of the centrioles, completion of the nuclear condensation, reduction of the cytoplasm, and the final differentiation of the flagellar complex. Mature spermatozoon has an oval nucleus, condensed chromatin, and typical 9 + 2 flagellar axoneme but lack acrosome. The role of the material in the nucleus and the cytoplasm as it reaches the Sertoli cell in the control of spermatogenesis is discussed.

N2  - To understand the light use properties of canopy leaves in K. obovata, the dominant mangrove species in the west coast of northern Taiwan, I compared photosynthesis related characters, such as leaf angles, leaf area, stomatal density, specific leaf area, and chlorophyll fluorescence, of upper and lower canopy leaves of the species. Leaves that had developed in exposed positions (upper canopy) exhibited significantly steeper leaf angles, smaller leaf area, higher stomatal density and lower specific leaf area than those in shaded positions (lower canopy). No significant difference was found in chlorophyll (Chl) content per unit leaf area and Chl a/b ratio between the two types of leaves. In contrast, compared to lower canopy leaves, upper canopy leaves had higher nitrogen content per unit leaf area indicating a higher light saturated CO2 assimilation. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurement revealed that photosaturated electron transport rate (ETR) and the photon flux required to saturate ETR were significantly higher in upper canopy leaves than in lower canopy leaves. The plasticity in morphological and physiological response to variation in light regimes may represent an important mechanism for K. obovata to adapt to the saline and nitrogen limiting environment.

N2  - Based on the database of 1986-2000 provided by the Wild Bird Federation Taiwan and a field assessment survey conducted between 1998 and 2000, four exotic species of cockatoos, belonging to the genus Cacatua (Psittacidae), were found in Taiwan. The Goffin's Cockatoo (C. goffini) and the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo (C. galerita) are more common than the White Cockatoo (C. alba) and the Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoo (C. sulphurea). Most of the sightings were in single or small flocks occurring in or near metropolitan areas of western Taiwan. The birds built permanent roosting sites that were occupied by one to three species. The feral populations of the cockatoos in Taiwan have remained low but fairly stable, since they were introduced more than 20 years ago. Overall, they are not successful invaders.

N2  - In this study, we attempted to understand changes in the vascular plants of Isl. Pengchiayu, an islet in waters north of the main island of Taiwan. In addition to visiting the islet 3 times to survey the flora, documents regarding floral studies of Isl. Pengchiayu since 1906 and specimens of this islet deposited in 2 local herbaria, TAI and TAIF, were all referenced. Records of species on this islet were divided into 2 periods: the past (1904~1933) and recent (1992~2005) across about 100 years. All the vascular plants known to have existed during this period are listed. Results show that there were 144 species, including infraspecies, inhabiting the islet in the past period. Among them, 53 species have not been found recently. On the other hand, 39 species which apparently did not occur in the past have recently been recorded. In total, 130 species are known to exist on the islets recently. Possible reasons for the changes are also proposed.

N2  - Fumonisins are a new class of toxic secondary metabolites produced by Fusarium species namely Fusarium moniliforme and Fusarium proliferatum that have recently come under intense scientific investigations. Thirty-two Fusarium isolates namely, Fusarium moniliforme (12 isolates), Fusarium proliferatum (5 isolates), Fusarium anthophilum (4 isolates), Fusarium oxysporum (3 isolates), Fusarium sporotrichioides (3 isolates), Fusarium pallidoroseum (3 isolates) and Fusarium solani (2 isolates), other four isolates of Aspergillus flavus (2 isolates) and Alternaria alternata (2 isolates), isolated from freshly harvested maize kernels were subjected to PCR analysis. The objective of this study was to develop a PCR-based detection kit for detection of fumonisin-producing Fusarium species. One set of primers based on the conserved ITS region of the genus Fusarium was used to differentiate the genus Fusarium from other fungal genera such as Aspergillus and Alternaria. The other set of primers specific to fumonisin producing 'FUM 1gene' region of Fusarium was used to differentiate the fumonisin producing Fusarium species from non-fumonisin producers. Results of the study revealed that PCR-based technique could be used not only to differentiate the Fusarium species from other genera of fungi but also to identify fumonisin-producing Fusarium moniliforme, F. proliferatum and F. anthophilum.

N2  - This paper presents a pilot study conducted to test the applicability of non-invasive sampling approach in population genetic studies of Taiwanese macaques (Macaca cyclopis). Monkey feces were collected in the field and used as non-invasive DNA sources. PCR success rates of both microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA markers were examined. When compared with other studies by non-invasive genetic sampling of different mammal species, success rate of microsatellite PCR amplification is low (42.4%, N=181) while that of mtDNA PCR amplification is acceptable (66.5%, N=334). The low PCR success rate and poor PCR repeatability of microsatellite alleles due to allelic dropout and false alleles make it difficult to obtain a reliable microsatellite data set. However, the difficulties may be overcome by new techniques.

N2  - The specimens of Pupalia micrantha Hauman collected from southern Taiwan have been misidentified as Cyathula prostrata (L.) Blume for many years. This is because little attention was given to the diagnostic characteristics of pseudostaminodes and the hooked spines fascicled on a short stalk. The distinction between these two species is that Pupalia micrantha is without pseudostaminodes and the hooks are fascicled on a short stalk, and Cyathula prostrata has pseudostaminodes and the hooks are fascicled without peduncles. Therefore, Pupalia micrantha is a newly naturalized species of Amaranthaceae in Taiwan and represents the first generic record of Pupalia. This species was sparsely distributed for the past 20 years and is not recorded in the Flora of China. The taxonomic treatment, descriptions, photographs, line drawing, two keys about the subfamilies and genera of Amaranthaceae are provided here.

N2  - To better understand the climatic characteristics in a subtropical mountainous cloud forest at the Yuanyang Lake long-term ecological research site, weather data collected from January 1994 to December 2004 were analyzed in the present study. The obvious seasonal changes in climatic factors were observed at this site. The annual mean air temperature was 12.7°C. The lowest temperature was recorded in February (monthly mean 5.9°C), and the highest one was taken in July (monthly mean 18.1°C). Winter featured light rain with a prolonged occurrence of fog, resulting in a large reduction of radiation. In summer, fog occurred once in the early morning and the other time from afternoon to evening. The latter one was associated with the wind direction changes and usually accompanied with short moderate to heavy convective rain. Consequently the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was high in the morning but reduced drastically in the afternoon. Typhoons occurred in the summer had contributed to 37% of the annual rainfall, usually resulting in torrential rain events and sharp increases in the water level of this lake. As a matter of fact, perhumid environment of this site was attributed to abundant rainfall (mean annual precipitation 3396 mm) and high frequency (up to 40%) of foggy time. Such conditions would reduce the intensity of solar radiation and PPFD. The average annual solar radiation at the site was 2475 MJ m^(-2), and annual PPFD was 5713 mol m^(-2). The average degree of reduction of PPFD under foggy condition was up to 88%. Such climatic characteristics are suggested to constrain the growth of plants and play an important role in competition among plant species in this cloud forest. It is considered that the distinct seasonal fluctuation in environmental factors, perhumid and dim light conditions are the most distinguished characteristics of this subtropical mountainous cloud forest ecosystem.

In addition, the relationship, conservation status and Cibachrome photographs of the type materials for some species have also been included wherever found necessary. Based on field and herbarium studies nine species (i.e. A. alitschuri B. Fedtsch, A. charguschanus Freyn, A. contortuplicatus L., A. flemingii Ali, A. iodotropis Boiss. & Hohen, A. pyrrhotrichus Boiss., A. subumbellatus Klotz., A. stocksii Bunge, A. zacharensis Bunge) have been excluded, as they do not occur in the present political boundaries of India of 1971. Those species have also been discussed here which have been recently transferred from Astragalus to some other genera like Ophiocarpus (Bunge) Ikonn., Podolotus Benth. and Podlechiella Maassoumi & Kaz. Osaloo. The present investigation also reveals that about 12 species are not represented in Indian herbaria, while they have been recorded from India based on very old collections housed at different foreign herbaria. A new combination Caragana aegacanthoides (Parker) Chaudhary & Srivastava has been proposed based on Astragalus aegacanthoides Parker.

N2  - Polyploidization is a significant mode of speciation in plants. Polyploids often occupy habitats different from those of their diploid parents. In Taiwan, two varieties of Pteris fauriei, one diploid and one triploid, have been identified. The number of spores per sporangium and the size of spores are reliable indicators of ploidy. Diploid P. fauriei have 64-spore sporangia and the spores are significantly smaller than spores of triploid plants, which have 32-spore sporangia. Based on these findings, the distribution and habitats of the two cytotypes in Taiwan are characterized from both living plants and herbarium specimens. Altogether, 516 live plants from 32 locations and 76 herbarium specimens were analyzed. In general, diploid plants occur in warmer habitats than triploid plants. Diploid plants are widely distributed in Taiwan and nearby islands, but do not occur in central Taiwan nor in the Matsu islands. In contrast, triploid plants are not found in southern tip of Taiwan nor on islands west of central Taiwan. In northern Taiwan and on the west-central islands, diploids grow most often in exposed sites and grasslands. However, in southern Taiwan and islands Lanyu and Lutao, diploids also occur in woodlands. Triploids are restricted to grassland and woodland habitats in Taiwan, but grow in exposed sites, grassland and woodland habitats in Matsu islands. In general, triploids grow at higher elevations than the diploids.

N2  - Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze forma formosensis Kitamura is generally referred to as the tea plant growing naturally in mid-elevation mountains of Taiwan. Several taxonomic treatments have been published for this plant in the past, but some contradictory results have been obtained. To assess the taxonomic position of the wild tea plant and explore its relationship with two other closely related taxa, C. sinensis var. sinensis and C. sinensis var. assamica, 16 vegetative and 11 floral characters were examined on 165 OTUs. Tze data were analyzed using cluster analysis and nonlinear principal components analysis. All cluster phenograms consistently separated the native wild tea plant from two other related taxa. Conversely, pronounced admixture between C. sinensis var. sinensis and C. sinensis var. assamica was present. The nonlinear principal components analysis indicated that the surface features of buds and ovaries are two diagnostic characters. Based on the present study, it is proposed that the Taiwan native wild tea plant might deserve recognition as a distinct species.

N2  - The present study elucidated the embryonic and larval development of snakehead Channa striatus from fertilization until metamorphosis. The snakehead was successfully bred in the laboratory by injecting ovaprim, a synthetic hormone (0.5mL/kg body weight). Spawning took place 24-26 hrs after the hormone injection. The fertilized eggs were floating, non-adhesive and straw yellow in color. The average diameter of fertilized eggs ranged from 1.20-1.40mm. Incubation periods was about 23-24hr at a temperature of 29±1℃. The percentage of hatching varied from 80-85. The newly hatched larva was 3.4±0.2 mm in length. The yolk absorption was completed within three days after hatching. The larvae metamorphosed into juveniles within 20 days after hatching.

N2  - Induced breeding experiments of Nikishigoi (koi carp), Cyprinus carpio were conducted in mature males and females by administrating a single intramuscular injection of ovaprim at a dosage of 0.3mL/kg weight. Spawning was observed six hrs after the injection at ambient temperature (26-28℃). The fertilized eggs were adhesive and transparent with diameter ranging between 0.9mm and 1.10mm. Incubation period was 73.00hrs. The hatchlings were transparent and measured 2.7-2.9mm, with a large oval head, a well defined yolk sac and short tail. The yolk got fully absorbed within 3 days and by this time mouth formation was complete and the larvae started exogenous feeding. After 20 days the length of fry ranged between 10mm and 12mm and after 35 days length of the fingerlings ranged from 30-35mm and appeared just like an adult in all respects except sexual maturity.

N2  - This investigation, undertaken in the two regions of Nanshi and Yujing in Tainan County over the period of 2001 to 2003, included three nests belonging to the Eastern Grass Owl (Tyto longimembris). From these, we collected a total of 157 owl pellets. Analysis and examination of the pellets revealed 329 prey items. More in-depth investigation determined that 95.1% of the Eastern Grass Owl pellets collected consisted of mammal remains, while the remaining 4.9% were made up of bird remains. Of the various types of mammals consumed, rats made up the highest proportion, with a total of 285 rats, accounting for 86.6%. This was followed by 27 shrews and moles, accounting for 8.2%. Hares and birds were seldom caught and consumed. The findings suggested that rats are the main food source of the Eastern Grass Owl, with the Spinus Country-rat (Rattus losea) comprising the majority with 136 counted (41.3%), followed by the Formosan Mouse (Mus caroli) with 96 counted (29.2%). Regarding biomass, the reversion method was used to calculate that owls at the three nests consumed approximately 22,987 grams of mammal and 480 grams of bird, accounting for 98.0% and 2.0%, respectively. The biomass consumed for each pellet was approximately 149.5 g.

N2  - Bacterial activity is one of the factors to determine the maturity and quality of the composts. In order to have a better understanding of the composition of bacteria involving in the composting processes, the facultative thermophilic bacrerial community of local composts was analyzed. A total of 412 colonies were isolated and analyzed by amplified rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and traditional colony observation, staining and biochemical tests. The isolates were divided into 24 groups mainly by ARDRA. Among these groups, the largest one contained 137 isolates. Mostly, the ARDRA analysis was in good conformity with the analysis of traditional methods: both results indicated that group 17 was a distinct one. The phylogenetic tree constructed based on the 16S rDNA sequence analysis demonstrated that the bacterial community of composts analyzed in this study was dominated by Bacillus spp., closely related to Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus sonorensis. Only 16 isolates in group 17 were Pseudomonas spp., closely related to Pseudomonas stutzer.

N2  - A phytosociological survey was carried out in the middle and upper watershed of the Nan-Tze-Shian stream in southwestern Taiwan in order to determine the relationship between vegetation and environmental factors. Through the use of the tabular comparison method, a hierarchical vegetation classification was established. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was applied to the data to clarify the variation of the 70 plots and search for a relationship with 5 environmental variables. The results show that the distribution of vegetation types is responding to the elevation and Whole Light Sky space (WLS). Three alliances and 9 associations were distinguished and described: (I) Cyclobalanopsis stenophylloides alliance, including Neolitsea acuminatissima-Cyclobalanopsis morii, Vaccinium randaiense-Castanopsis cuspidata and Pasania kawakamii-Cyclobalanopsis stenophylloides associations, (II) Beilschmiedia erythrophloia alliance, including Camellia salicifolia-Beilschmiedia erythrophloia, Engelhardtia roxburghiana-Cyclobalanopsis longinux and Helicia formosana-Castanopsis kusanoi associations, and (III) Machilus kusanoi alliance, including Castanopsis formosana-Machilus philippinense, Machilus zuihoensis-Schefflera octophylla and Ficus irisana-Machilus kusanoi associations.

N2  - The fern, Phymatosorus longissimus (Bl.) Pic. Serm., was believed to be locally extinct in Taiwan. However, we recently rediscovered this species in Mudan, Pingtung County and Lanyu Island, Taitung County of Taiwan. The species has currently been found in wetlands neighboring cultivated fields. These habitats are prone to the disturbance of human activities, which may lead to another future extinction of the species in Taiwan. Based on the IUCN criteria, we proposed Phymatosorus longissimus (Bl.) Pic. Serm. to be a critically endangered species in Taiwan. We also discussed the taxonomy and the distribution of this species.

N2  - Solanum is a large and morphologically diverse genus comprising almost 75% of the species in the family Solanaceae. Twenty species were recorded in Taiwan. Solanum miyakojimense Yamazaki & Takushi was published in 1991 as an endemic species in Miyako Islands, Ryukyu. A careful examination of herbarium collections supplemented by field studies confirmed the occurrence of this species in Lanyu, Taiwan. In this report we provide the description, line drawings, and colored photographs taken from the natural habitat to aid in identification of this species.

N2  - The goal of the study is to provide a comprehensive taxonomic account of 12 endemic species of Astragalus occurring in India. The north-west Himalayan region harbors more endemic species (11 spp.) than eastern Himalaya where only two species have been noticed from Sikkim. Jammu & Kashmir with seven species occupies first position in the list of endemic species. Five species are strictly confined to Jammu & Kashmir, while two species to Uttaranchal and one species to Sikkim. Only one species (A. tenuicaulis) is found in both the Himalayas, otherwise the elements of both the Himalayas are quite distinct from each other. Most of the endemic species of Astragalus have been observed quite rare in the nature except A. uttaranchalensis. In the present investigation, A. turgidus, a newly described species from Jammu & Kashmir, has been found conspecific to A. kashmirensis. For each species nomenclature, description, distribution, phenology, taxonomic notes, list of the investigated materials, distribution map and figures are given. A new combination A. falconeri var. pilosus (Ali) Chaudhary has been proposed based on A. hoffmeisteri var. pilosus Ali. A new endemic species A. nainitalensis from Kumaon Himalaya has also been described here along with illustrations.

N2  - The forest in Lanjenchi is a remnant patch of subtropical rainforests in southern Taiwan. In 1998, the previous Lanjenchi plot was enlarged from 3 ha to 5.88 ha in order to include more topographical variation and understand how the gradient of wind stress controls forest structure and species composition. All free-standing woody plants in these plots with diameter ≥ 1 cm were identified, measured, tagged and mapped. A total of 60,146 individuals belonging to 136 vascular tree species in 83 genera and 42 families was recorded. Families with the largest cumulative basal areas were Fagaceae, Theaceae, Araliaceae, Aquifollaceae, Lauraceae and Illiciaceae. The size-class distribution of all species showed that most species were in good recruitment patterns with the most stems in small size classes. The results of two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) classified the sampling plots into four forest and habitat types: 1. Rhaphiolepis indica var. hiiranensis-Illicium arborescens (Windward I) type; 2. Cinnamomum brevipedunculatum-Illicium arborescens (Windward Ⅱ) type; 3. Sloanea formosana - Ilex cochinchinensis (Leeward) type; and 4. Glycosmis citrifolia - Helicia formosana (Creek) type. The forest composition changes formed a sequence on the topographic gradient from the most exposed windward ridges and north-east-facing slopes to more sheltered leeward footslopes and creeks. Further studies using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) confirmed the results of TWINSPAN, and showed the important roles of the topographic variables in the distribution of most tree species.

N2  - Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a low-molecular-weight phospholipid derivative released by activated platelets. S1P transduces signals through a family of G protein-coupled receptors to modulate various physiological behaviors of endothelial cells. Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1; CD31) is a 130-kDa protein expressed on the surfaces of leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells. Upon PECAM-1 activation, its cytoplasmic tyrosine residues become phosphorylated and bind with SH2 domain-containing proteins, thus leading to the downstream functions mediated by PECAM-1. In the present study, we found that S1P induced PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and SHP-2 association in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) by immunoprecipitation and western blotting. The pretreatment of BAECs with a series of chemical inhibitors to determine the signaling pathway showed that the PECAM-1 phosphorylation was inhibited by PP2, indicating the participation of Src family kinases. These results demonstrated that S1P induced PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in BAECs through mediation of Src family kinases, and this may regulate the physiological behaviors of endothelial cells.

N2  - The genus Boerhavia is distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Old and New World in both hemispheres. Many are characteristic of coastal habitats. It is represented in Taiwan by five species: B. coccinea Mill., B. erecta L., B. repens L., B. glabrata Bl., and B. hualienense Chen & Wu sp. nov. Boerhavia coccinea and B. erecta are recently known as alien species. Boerhavia repens and B. glabrata, both incorrectly reported previously in Taiwan as B. diffusa L., are recognized. Boerhavia hualienense is a new species from eastern Taiwan. In this paper we present a brief revision of the Taiwanese species of Boerhavia. A key to its taxa along with descriptions, line drawings, ecology, taxonomical notes, and a map showing the distribution of all five species on this island are provided.

N2  - Spatial patterns of trees in a lowland rainforest in the 5.88-ha Lanjenchi plot of the southernmost Taiwan were evaluated. Among the 88 species with more than 15 individuals, 87.5% had an aggregated distribution pattern, and 9.1% species were randomly distributed. Rare species tended to be more aggregated than common species at all distance scales. As for different DBH size classes, 35.5% species shifted from highly aggregated patterns to a low level of aggregation or random distribution with an increase in tree size, and 11.3% species had an inverse pattern. When comparing spatial patterns among different habitats within the plot, the aggregation intensity increased along a wind-stress gradient from the sheltered creek to the most exposed slopes. No species displayed a regular pattern in any size class or habitat type. This study revealed that distribution of most species within the Lanjenchi forest was related to habitat heterogeneity. Other factors, such as dispersal limitation, however, may also play a role in determining the distribution patterns.

N2  - The present study deals with the quantitative floristic inventory of three tropical forest types in Similipal Biosphere Reserve in Eastern Ghats of Orissa, India. Three forest types were distinct in field and differed in dominance, composition, diversity and structure. The study resulted in documentation of a total 549 species of flowering plants. Altogether, 4819 stems of ≥30 cm gbh belonging to 185 tree species were enumerated and analysed. Tree stand density varied from 527 to 665 ha-1 with average basal area of 43.51 m^2ha^(-1). Shannon-Wiener index (H') ranges from 4.3 to 5.46. Similarity index revealed that only 25% of floristic composition of semi-evergreen forest was similar with moist deciduous forest. Analysis of population density of tree species across girth class interval showed that around 48.9% of individuals belong to 30-60 cm gbh. The present study can serve as baseline information for phytodiversity characterisation of tropical forests in the Similipal Biosphere Reserve in particular and Eastern Ghats of Orissa in general.

N2  - Taxonomic review of the genus Calocedrus in Vietnam accompanied with modern available data on distribution, ecology and habitat conditions of its two aboriginal species is presented. Detailed illustrated description of recently discovered species C. rupestris endemic to rocky limestone mountains of northern Vietnam is provided. This rare species differs from wide-spread C. macrolepis in obtuse to broadly-obtuse leaf apex; small, subsessile, 4-scaled, broadly-ovate seed cones 4-5(6) x 2.5-3(3.5) mm with very short stalk 0.5-1(1.5) mm long, having 6-8(12) obtuse scales, and fertile seed scales with incurved rounded apex having rough, more or less flat surface without any mucro. Trees of C. rupestris were found as a co-dominant in relictual coniferous forests on rocky hills and ridges composed of highly eroded limestone. Relictual primary, highly endangered woods with this rare tree, as well as their floristic complex represent a unique plant diversity center of global significance. Urgent and effective protection of these areas should be of highest priority for nature conservation activity.

N2  - Exotic weed invasion has been identified as one of the serious environmental problem impacting the structure, composition and function of biological diversity. They are aggressive colonizers, which have flexible habitat requirement and ability to outcompete native species. The present paper describes the distribution and autecology of an exotic weed Limnocharis flava (L.) Buchenau (an emergent aquatic weed of 'Limnocharitaceae') in Kumarakom Grama Panchayat, one of the well known tourist spot of South India famous for its vast stretches of paddy fields, wetlands and backwaters. The mapping of L. flava in the entire study area has been done using Geographical Information System (Arc-info 8.3 version). The growth and distribution pattern of L. flava were studied quantitatively. Data on distribution, abundance, biomass, ecological associations and root zone nutrient quality of water and sediment samples were collected from different sampling points of Kumarakom. The study reflected that nutrients, water depth and land use patterns were the major factors responsible for the growth and proliferation of this exotic weed. The strategies for controlling L. flava invasion are discussed in detail. If early steps are not taken to eradicate this weed, it will become a problematic weed in the same way as other noxious aquatic weeds like Salvinia molesta D. Mitch and Eichhornia crassipes (C. Martius) Solms-Laub.

N2  - The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a large multigene coding for glycoproteins that play a key role in the initiation of immune responses in vertebrates. For a better understanding of the immunologic diversity in thriving marine mammal species, the sequence variation of the exon 2 region of MHC DQB locus was analyzed in 42 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) collected from strandings and fishery bycatch in Taiwanese waters. The 172bp sequences amplified showed no more than two alleles in each individual. The high proportion of non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions and the moderate amount of variation suggest positive selection pressure on this locus, arguing against a reduction in the marine environment selection pressure. The phylogenetic relationship among DQB exon 2 sequences of T. truncatus and other cetaceans did not coincide with taxonomic relationship, indicating a trans-species evolutionary pattern.

N2  - The mating system of the Pheasant-tailed Jacana (Hydrophasianus chirurgus) is classical polyandry. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of polyandry. The replacement clutches hypothesis indicates that it would benefit both sexes if females produce more clutches as replacement when clutch lost rate is high. Females should be freed from parental duty in order to accumulate more energy for producing more replacement clutches and males should carry all or most of parental responsibility. By observing daily time budget of both males and females, we tested whether the replacement clutches hypothesis applied to Pheasant-tail Jacanas in Taiwan. Our results indicated that foraging behavior was the major activity of females in breeding season. Females spent significantly more time on foraging behavior than males during both early and late breeding stages. In males, the breeding behaviors were the dominant activity. Females increased foraging time and reduced breeding time from early to late breeding stage. Males lowered their foraging time and spent more time on breeding behaviors at the late breeding stage. The results were consistent with the predictions of the replacement clutches hypothesis. The time spent on breeding behaviors (mostly incubating behavior) of male Pheasant-tailed Jacanas peaked around noon. We suggest this was due to the high air temperature of the study site during breeding season. Males had to stay in the nests to provide eggs and chicks protection from high temperature and ultraviolet ray.

N2  - Ralstonia solanacearum, the causing agent of crop bacterial wilt, is a devastating bacterium with an unusually wide host range. To effectively integrate durable resistance to R. solanacearum into crops, comprehensive and global information on pathogenesis mechanisms employed by this pathogen is important. In this study, we report the development of an efficient Arabidopsis-based bioassay system useful for screening of large number of bacterium mutants with altered virulence. The effectiveness and uniqueness of this system was further demonstrated by the isolation of R. solanacearum mutants exhibiting differential pathogenesis and in vitro characteristics, and by the identification of mutants with the transposon inserted in known and novel loci. This highly efficient bioassay system, together with the accompanying in planta and in vitro bioassay systems described here, would facilitate comprehensive study on R. solanacearum pathogenesis mechanisms.

N2  - Spatial patterns of trees in a lowland rainforest at Nanjen Lake, southern Taiwan were evaluated. Among the 91 species with more than 15 individuals in the 1.61-ha plot, 90.1% species showed an aggregated distribution pattern, and 8.8% species were randomly distributed at the 4m scale. Along the distance scales, 71.4% species kept aggregated distribution pattern, and only one species remained randomly distributed at all distance scales. Rare species tended to be more aggregated than the common species. As for trees in different size classes, 40.9% highly aggregated species became less aggregated or even randomly distributed with the increase of tree size, while 9.1% species had an inverse pattern. As for trees in the size class≥8cm diameter, 68.2% species were randomly distributed and only 29.6% species were aggregated. No species displayed a regular pattern in any size class. There were four major habitat types in the study plot, including ridge, mid-slope, valley and streamside types. Our results suggested that the distribution patterns of most species within the Nanjen Lake plot were related to habitat heterogeneity, such that some species were only distributed along the streamside and some species could only be found on the ridge top. Other factors, such as dispersal limitation, might also play a role in determining the distribution patterns of trees.

N2  - In order to compare woody species diversity, spatial distribution of trees and stand structure on the basis of the architectural stratification between two types of subtropical forests in the northern part of Okinawa Island, Japan, tree censuses in a 750m^2 plot in silicate habitat and a 1000m^2 plot in limestone habitat were performed. It was found that both subtropical forests growing in silicate and limestone habitats consisted of four architectural layers. A total of 26 families, 43 genera, 60 species and 4684 individuals larger than 0.1 m high in the silicate habitat, and 31 families, 51 genera, 62 species and 4798 individuals larger than 0.0m high in the limestone habitat, were recorded. As a result, the floristic composition in the silicate habitat was quite different from that in the limestone habitat in terms of similarity index (C(subscript Π)=0.07); approximately only one-sixth of the species were in common. The floristic composition among layers was more similar in the silicate habitat than in the limestone habitat. Castanopsis sieboldii (Mak.) Hatusima was the most dominant species in the silicate habitat, but was completely absent in the limestone habitat where Cinnamomum japonicum Sieb. ex Nees was the most dominant species. The potential number of species in the silicate forest (62) was lower than that in the limestone forest (71). However, the woody species diversity was higher in the silicate forest than in the limestone forest. The values of H′ and J′ tended to increase from the top layer downward except for the bottom layer in the silicate forest, while this increasing trend was reversed in the limestone forest. It follows that high woody species diversity in the silicate forest depended on small-sized trees, whereas in the limestone forest it depended on big-sized trees. The spatial distribution of trees in the forests was random in each layer, except the top layer, where there existed a double-clump structure. High degree of overlapping in the spatial distribution of trees among layers suggested that light can not penetrate easily to the lower layers, so that understory trees might be shade-tolerant species. Mean tree weight decreased from the top toward the bottom layer, whereas tree density increased from the top downward. It was concluded that this trend was general in both of the forests, and this trend successfully expressed in the same form as in the mean weight-density trajectory of self-thinning plant populations.

N2  - The present study deals with the assessment of quantitative structure and floristic composition of tropical forests of Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Western Ghats, India. Forest structure was analyzed across girth classes and height intervals. Altogether 156 tree species were analyzed. Vegetation type-wise Importance Value Index, Shannon-Weiner index, Simpson index, Margalef's index and Pielou Index were calculated. The tree stand density varies from 112-406.8 ha^(-1) with the average basal area of 26.25m^2/ha^(-1). Shannon-Weiner Index (H') ranges from 3.94-4.90. The Simpson Index of dominance varies from 0.86-0.94. The Margalef Species Richness Index varies from 4.61-8.31. The population density of tree species across girth class intervals shows that 65.4% and 36.4% of individuals belong to 30-60cm gbh. Tree distribution by height class intervals shows that around 28.7% of individuals are in the height class of 20-25m, followed by 24.4% in the height of 15-20m, whereas 3.37% of individuals are in the height class of＞30m.

N2  - Individuals of Marsilea quadrifolia, an amphibious fern, experiencing extreme variations in environment develop heterophyll with different morphological characteristics. The objective of this study is to investigate if ethylene can induce floating type of leaves in this fern. To achieve this goal, ratio of stomatal density on abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces (stomatal ratio) and the mass per unit length of petiole (PML), on leaves of terrestrial shoots sprayed with an ethylene gas releaser, Ethephon, were compared with those of leaves produced by submergence of terrestrial shoots. Leaves with different stomatal ratio and PML, corresponding to that of terrestrial type and floating type of leaves, were produced when terrestrial shoots of M. quadrifolia were submerged. The result reveals that the plasticity of leaves to respond to submergence depends on leaf's age. Application of Ethephon significantly altered the stomatal ratio of young leaves on terrestrial shoot but not their PML. Leaves response to Ethephon treatment was also age dependent. These results indicate that ethylene might be involved in the formation of floating leaves in M. quadrifolia.

N2  - Curculigo orchioides Gaertn. is an endangered medicinal plant with anticancer properties. The rhizome and tuberous roots of the plant have been used extensively in India in indigenous medicine. Due to its multiple uses, the demand for Curculigo orchioides is constantly on the rise; however, the supply is rather erratic and inadequate. Destructive harvesting, combined with habitat destruction in the form of deforestation has aggravated the problem. The plant is now considered 'endangered' in its natural habitat. Therefore, the need for conservation of this plant is crucial. Here, we describe a successful protocol for multiple shoot induction of C. orchioides using shoot tip and rhizome disc. We find that proximal rhizome discs are optimal for high frequency shoot bud formation than shoot tip and distal rhizome disc. We observed a synergistic effect between 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and kinetin (KN) (each at 1 mg/L) on the regeneration of shoot buds from proximal rhizome disc than shoot tip explant. Optimum root induction was achieved on half-strength MS liquid medium supplemented with 1 mg/L of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). The in vitro raised plantlets were acclimatized in green house and successfully transplanted to natural condition with 90% survival.

N2  - Of c. 530 Pteridophytes reported as endemic to the India in recent decades (about half the total number of c. 950-1000 known Indian species), the great bulk are mistaken, particularly those from the Indo-Himalaya. Only 47 endemic Indian ferns, less than 10% of those reported previously, are accepted here. But this figure includes several that are rather doubtfully endemic, mainly due to unresolved taxonomic doubt, or because they may be expected to occur in adjacent Countries. Thus 8 are taxonomically dubious, requiring further study, and a further 7, all from N.E. India, may possibly be expected elsewhere outside India. The c. 483 mistaken pseudo-endemics arose mainly due to naming of erroneous ”new species” thought to be endemic, or due to not knowing the range of species outside political India, combined with insufficient investigative taxonomic research.In the present paper previous reports of endemics are listed and their status is reappraised along with a new list of accepted endemics. Quite opposite to previous conclusions, the great majority of endemic Indian Pteridophytes are peninsular-Indian to south-Indian ferns (27, plus 5 more taxonomically dubious), with far fewer being N.E. Indian (7, all of which may possibly be expected elsewhere outside India) and W. Himalayan (2, plus 1 taxonomically dubious); the floristically Malesian Nicobar Islands have (3, plus 2 more taxonomically dubious). These numbers are only to be expected as N.E. India is an intimate part of the Sino-Himalayan and S.E. Asian flora, connected without barriers to Tibet and China or to Myanmar by two mountain chains, while S. India is more isolated geographically since more ancient times and has a partly Malesian fern-flora. Some details of Indian endemics in relation to phytogeographical elements are given.Endemic species: Huperzia-1, Selaginella-9, Isoetes-1, Osmunda-1, Arthromeris-1, Phymatosorus-1, Oreogrammitis-2, Trichomanes-1, Pteris-1, Cyathea-3, Lindsaea-3, Asplenium-3, Thelypteris-3, Athyrium-2, Tectaria-1, Dryopsis-1, Dryopteris-3, Polystichum-4, Bolbitis-3, Elaphoglossum-3.

N2  - A 8.37-ha plot of the broad-leaved forest at an elevation of about 2000 m in the upstream basin of the Nantzuhsienhsi River in mid-southern Taiwan was set up for long-term monitoring of forest dynamics. All stems with diameter at breast height (d. b. h.) ≧1 cm were identified, measured, tagged, and mapped to analyze the forest composition, structure and species diversity of the plot. A total of 18,790 woody plant individuals, belonging to 64 species in 27 families, were recorded. The dominant families were Lauraceae, Fagaceae, and Theaceae, accounting for 78.8% of total individuals. The dominant species were Castanopsis carlesii, Machilus japonica, Listea acuminate, and Cyclobalanopsis stenophylloides. The most abundant species in the canopy layer was Castanopsis carlesii, in the subcanopy layer was Listea acuminate, and in the shrub layer were Machilus japonica and Listea acuminata. Four plant communities were identified based on Two-way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) classification, including three evergreen forest types and one deciduous forest type. The three evergreen types are Machilus japonica type, locating on the east and west valleys and partial lower slopes, Machilus japonica-Castanopsis carlesii type, locating on middle to lower slopes and the central dry valley, and Schima superba-Castanopsis carlesii type, locating on eastern ridge and upper slopes. The deciduous type is Alnus formosana forest which is distributed on mid-west and southwestern ridges. The means of species number, density and basal area for different forest types declined gradually from ridge to valley habitats. These results reveal that topography is an important factor which is closely related to the distribution of evergreen broad-leaved forest types in the plot.

N2  - Astragalus is considered one of the most diverse genera in the family Leguminosae (nom. alt. Fabaceae). Although a large number of works have been carried out on the genus, no monograph is available except some regional accounts and revisions chiefly at sectional level. It may be due to the sheer size of the genus (ca. 3000 spp.) and diverse nature, the genus is quite variable in habit and habitats, size of the plants, nature of indumentums, stipules, leaf rachis, types of inflorescence, relative length of petals, pods etc. Usually, genus is divided into eight to ten subgenera and more than 245 sections. In recently conducted molecular phylogenetic studies it has been shown that none of the subgenera and large sections are monophyletic. However, it has been clearly demonstrated that Astragalus is monophyletic except some outlier species. The chromosome numbers are also quite interesting and significant in Astragalus for its phylogenetic studies. There is a strong correlation between its geographic distribution and chromosome numbers. Currently about 80 species have been recorded from India chiefly from the Himalayas. Except some of our recent publications, not much studies have been carried out on the genus in India after 'The Flora of British India'. Astragalus is not of much economic importance, however, some of its species are well known for commercial gum tragacanth production especially in Iran and China. In India, A. candolleanus is a well known drug as 'Rudanti' or 'Rudravanti' used for tuberculosis, skin diseases, coughs and blood purifier. The aim of this article is to review the entire work carried out on Astragalus and to bring out scattered information at one place for better understanding of the subject and to find out the future prospective of the research in India on the genus.

N2  - We investigated tree diversity in 'giant evergreen forest' of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which falls within the Indo-Burma hot spot of biodiversity in the world. A one hectare square plot was established in sites Kalapahad (KP) and Macarthy Valley (MV) of Middle Andamans, in which all trees ≥30 cm girth at breast height (gbh) were enumerated. Tree diversity totaled 105 species that belonged to 63 genera and 49 families. Site MV harboured ~10% greater species richness than KP. Species diversity indices did not vary much between the two sites. In the two sites, there were 1311 individuals of trees (579 ha^(-1) in KP and 732 in MV). The stand basal area was nearly equal in both the sites (KP- 45.59 m^2 ha^(-1); MV- 47.93 m^2 ha^(-1)). Thirteen tree species (12.38%) were strict endemics to Andamans. Ten species recorded are rare to the flora of these islands. The two sites are distinctly dominated by two different plant families; Dipterocarpaceae in KP and Myristicaceae in MV. Most of the species were common to central and lower region of Myanmar and Indian mainland. The forest stand structure exhibited a typical reverse-J shape, but site MV had double the density of stems in the lower tree size class than that of KP. The voluminous dipterocarps contributed more to the total above-ground live biomass. The need to preserve these species- and endemics-rich, fragile island forests, prioritized for biodiversity conservation, is emphasized.

N2  - Hay-fever and allergic rhinitis have been a serious problem in Kinmen, an island close to mainland China. To elucidate the relationship of pollen and spores to such a problem, an aeropalynological study was conducted during 2003 in Kinmen. In Kinmen's Kin-Hu City, a Burkard seven-day volumetric pollen trap was installed on the roof of a house, about 10 m above the ground, to collect airborne pollen samples. Over a study period of one year, a total of 50,278 pollen grains and fern spores, belonging to 51 taxa of 39 families were identified. Among them, 33 families were angiosperms, two families gymnosperms, and four families ferns. Twelve taxa produced a higher percentage of airborne pollen in this survey. They are Casuarina (27.5%), Morus (15.2%), Fraxinus (12.3%), Pinus (11.3%), Dicranopteris (7.0%), Celtis (5.0%), Juniperus (4.2%), Ambrosia (4.0%), Gramineae (2.8%), Liquidambar (1.3%), Podocarpus (1.1%), and Artemisia (0.5%). The highest concentrations of airborne pollen were detected over the period from mid February to mid June. The dominant pollen species varied with seasons, with Morus, Juniperus and Liquidambar dominating in February and the beginning of March, Pinus in February and March, Celtis in March, Casuarina in April, May, June, and August, Podocarpus from the end of April to the beginning of May, Fraxinus in June, Dicranopteris in June and July, Ambrosia in August, Artemisia in October, and Gramineae in November. Throughout the study time, arboreal pollen (79.9%) was more abundant than non-arboreal pollen (8.5%) and fern spore (8.1%). Ragweed pollen, the allergenic one, reached its maximum in the atmosphere in August and showed a peak of diurnal periodicity at 7:00-9:00 am. As a result of this study, a pollen calendar for Kinmen was established to illustrate the seasonal variations in the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of airborne pollen and spores. The data of the present study provide a basis for further pollinosis studies in Kinmen.

N2  - Tissue specific RNA in-situ hybridization is a critical technique required for botanists to examine exact gene expression domain within plant tissues. This powerful technique provides a way to examine the spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression of plants and animals in developmental stages content and at tissue cellular level. However, this technique has been largely hampered by difficulties of obtaining reliable protocols for non-model organism. Here we offer our lab experiences on how to optimize in-situ hybridization process among various plant species. This step-by-step guide however should not be regarded as the only solution to resolve the difficulties of RNA tissue specific RNA in-situ hybridization. Instead, the key optimization steps including tissue fixation time, proteinase/pronase treatment, probe length/content and hybridization time are priority issues to be tested first. We further summarized some recent advance of literature on alternative ways to conduct in-situ hybridization process.

N2  - Venuloid idioblasts are vein-like structures. In Pteris, they are long epidermal cells with very thick cell walls. In this study, venuloid idioblasts of Pteris grevilleana were investigated with various light microscopic (LM) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) techniques and the main purposes of these microscopic techniques are summarized and discussed. To investigate the morphology and distribution of venuloid idioblasts, partial polarization LM technique and cryo-tabletop-SEM technique were used. The idioblasts had lobed margins, acute or round ends, and could be found on both upper and lower epidermis of fertile fronds and sterile fronds. They are distributed on veins, interveinal regions, and leaf margins, but not on costules, costae, and false indusia. By using histochemical staining and SEM with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), it was confirmed that the idioblasts contained silicon. In addition, the venuloid-idioblast-like silica bodies were extracted by wet oxidation method. These indicate that the venuloid indioblast in P. grevilleana is a kind of spicular cell (long epidermal cells containing silica bodies, which are found in Adiantoids and Vittarioids).

It was also superfluous for Silene fissipetala Turcz. (1854) as their holotypes are isotypes of each other (McNeill et al., 2006, Art. 9 Note 2). A new varietal combination is proposed for Silene kiiruninsularis Masam.

N2  - Bunzo Hayata was the founding father of the study of the flora of Taiwan. From 1900 to 1921 Taiwan's flora was the focus of his attention. During that time he named about 1600 new taxa of vascular plants from Taiwan. Three topics are presented in this paper: a biography of Bunzo Hayata; Hayata's contributions to the flora of Taiwan; and the current status of Hayata's new taxa. The second item includes five subitems: i) floristic studies of Taiwan before Hayata, ii) the first 10 years of Hayata's study of the flora of Taiwan, iii) Taiwania, iv) the second 10 years, and v) Hayata's works after the flora of Taiwan. The third item is the first step of the evaluation of Hayata's contribution to the flora of Taiwan. New taxa in Icones Plantarum Formosanarum vol. 10 and the gymnosperms described by Hayata from Taiwan are exampled in this paper.

N2  - A fundamental step in biodiversity conservation is to identify potential distribution and quality habitat for a desired species, especially when the target is rare and difficult to detect. We demonstrated a GIS application in developing a quick predictive model to study the globally vulnerable Fairy Pitta (Pitta nympha) in Taiwan. We compiled sighting data between 1982 and 2000, established a rule-based model to predict its distribution, and applied the predictive map to design a sampling protocol, conduced field surveys to evaluate the accuracy of the model and to obtain hotspots. The results showed that most known distribution of the Fairy Pitta occurred in low elevation, hilly and forested areas. The map predicted 21.6% areas of Taiwan suitable for the Fairy Pitta and 78% of them occurred in western Taiwan. A total of 511 pittas were detected during the 2001 survey that covered 4% areas of Taiwan or 14.3% of predictive areas, with a mean of 30.2% detection probability per grid cell (2×2 km in resolution). The adjusted data indicated that the overall accuracy of our model was increased to 40.3% with 290 qualified cells. Most of the new sightings of the Fairy Pitta arising from the 2001 field survey fell in our predictive areas with most of them occurring in western Taiwan. The probability of detecting pitta was highest in the active selection cells within predictive areas. Based on mean number of pitta detected per cell, the hotspots of the Fairy Pitta in Taiwan included three regions: the watershed of Shimen Reservoir within Hsinchu and Taoyuan County, Linnei of Yulin County and the watershed of Wusanto Reservoir in Tainan County. We concluded that the model provides quick and effective predictions for planning conservation strategies and is particularly useful for rare species.

N2  - Microbes encounter various environmental factors which frequently cause detrimental effects on their population dynamics. Ralstonia solanacearum is a devastating bacterium causing a deadly and very complex disease of many agronomically important crops. To better control the disease, information about responses of distinct strains of this bacterium to environmental factors is certainly important but still insufficient. In this study, effects of salinity, excess copper, extreme pHs, drought and light on the propagation and survival of a representative of R. solanacearum strains in Taiwan, Pss4, were assessed. Our results showed that salinity negatively affected Pss4 multiplication in rich media at a dose-dependent manner, but resulted in negligent effects on its survival in sand and in water. In the presence of excess copper, similar negative effects on Pss4 culturability in rich media and at a less level on that in sand occurred. Additionally, Pss4 multiplication in rich media was substantially reduced at pH 9.0 and at a less degree at pH 5.0. Moreover, the survival of this bacterium in sand was sensitive to drought, but it sustained under incident light in water. The results were compared with previous studies on distinct R. solanacearum strains prevalent in different geographic regions and discussed in detail. The information gathered from this study would pave to the way for future studies on field samples to advance disease epidemiology and develop feasible strategies for disease control in Taiwan.

N2  - The exine of mature pollen grains of Rhoiptelea chiliantha was studied. The size of the pollen grains is about 23 by 27 μm. They are tricolporate with short colpi that are 1-2 μm wide and 10-12 long. The spinules of Rhoiptelea are similar in form and size to those of Gentianales. The spinules consist of rods of ca 70 nm in width. These rods are evident throughout the tectum and columellae. The columellae are of two distinct sizes. The smaller ones are ca 70 nm wide and join the tectum and the larger columellae. These larger ones appear to be composed of several 70 nm in width rods. They join the distal surface of the foot layer. The proximal surface of the foot layer is marked by a white line (referred to as a junction plane) where it joins the endexine. The endexine consists of a solid-appearing component adjacent to the foot layer (referred to as endexine-1) and laminar components (endexine-2) that are attached to and apparently become a part of endexine-1. There is no indication of an arcus. In well preserved grains the aperture is covered by an operculum or operculum-like component. In well-rehydrated pollen grains there is an oncus of considerable complexity under the aperture and over the intine. The Ubisch bodies have an exine ornamented with widely-spaced spinules like the spinules on the pollen exine.

N2  - The life cycle of the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon flos-aquae was elucidated based on data concerning the growth, formation and degradation of the bloom, as well as consideration of its mechanism. Abiotic factors such as water temperature, pH and day length are of critical importance in determining not only the growth in the water, but also germination and formation ofakinetes. Besides these abiotic factors, biotic factors such as competition between coexisting phytoplankton and grazing byzooplankton should be taken into consideration-particularly at the initial and final stages of the bloom.

N2  - The genus Alpinia in Taiwan was very impressed by its frequent hybridization. Four out of 6 indigenous species in Taiwan proper have been reported to be involved in a reticulate hybridization. This paper describes and illustrates a new natural hybrid A. × ilanensis, putatively derived from A. japonica and A. pricei, which is supported by morphological and ecogeographical evidences. Based on sparse distribution mode and serious fertility reduction in these hybrid individuals, we suppose that the hybridization events between A. japonica and A. pricei have been independently occurred multiple times in field. This newly discovered hybrid reveals that all 6 independent species in this island possess the ability to cross each other.

It can be easily differentiated from its closest taxon, H. speciosum Wall., by its elliptic leaves, longer ligules with shallowly bilobe apices, the calyx tubes being shorter than the bract, the lanceolate-oblong or spathulate staminodes with the acute to rounded apices, and the sub-orbicular to orbicular labella with the 2-clefted apeces and the short claws. The relationship with other related species is also discussed.

N2  - The flora of Taiwan, comprising more than 4,400 vascular plant species, is one of the best studied of Asian floras. Herbarium collections of Taiwanese plants document the island's plant diversity and serve as important reference material for botanists and conservationists. Collections made during the Japanese colonial period in Taiwan (1895-1945) are of special interest in that they mark the first attempt at a truly comprehensive botanical inventory of the island. Unfortunately, these early collections are not widely distributed and are often in poor condition in Taiwanese herbaria. As such, the existence of a large, under-documented collection of Taiwanese plants in the Herbarium of the Academy of Natural Sciences-Philadelphia (PH), with many specimens collected during the Japanese colonial period, is likely to be of interest to the botanical and conservation communities in Taiwan and elsewhere. To determine the size and taxonomic scope of the collection, its historical and taxonomic importance, and the historical details of its assembly, a systematic survey was conducted in which all of the Taiwanese material was separated from the general collection at PH. Specimen label data were recorded from a phylogenetically diverse selection of plant families. The Academy’s collection was found to contain about 6,260 Taiwanese plant specimens, including representatives of 150 of the 198 seed plant families that occur in Taiwan. Within selected families, broad taxonomic representation of Taiwanese genera (33%-100%) and species (15%-100%) was encountered. Specimens in the collection were gathered between 1861 and 1977, with 90% the specimens dating to the periods 1905 (9%), 1929-1935 (28%), and 1955-1973 (53%). Over 60 collectors are represented. A preliminary search of the taxonomic literature indicates that significant type material is contained within the collection. Historical research revealed that most of the collection was assembled in Philadelphia by Hui-Lin Li (1911-2002), former professor of botany at the University of Pennsylvania and important figure in the history of floristic research in Taiwan.

N2  - This is the last part of study about the diatom flora found in the Mystery Lake, a slightly acidic lake situated within a hardwood nature preserve in northeastern Taiwan. In this article, we reported 17 species, belonging to 4 genera, 4 families, and 2 orders, based on scanning electron microscopic observations. The species described here, 9 are newly recorded in Taiwan. They are: Navicula cryptotenella, Navicula ingrata, Navicula subfasciata, Pinnularia borealis var. rectangularis, Pinnularia interrupta, Pinnularia maior, Sellaphora laevissima, S. vitabunda, and Nitzschia perminuta. In total, we found 76 diatom species in the surface sediments of this lake. Among them, 33 (43%) are newly recorded to Taiwan. The present study indicates that this lake is characterized by high species diversity and high species richness, which are related to the oligotrophic and non-polluted environmental conditions.

N2  - Rice is one of the most important food crops of the world which is grown in various agro climatic conditions and it encounters several biotic and abiotic stresses. Among biotic stresses bacterial leaf blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is the major destructive disease in the world. There is no chemical effective against this disease, so growing resistant varieties is the only way to decrease the losses caused by the disease. To develop durable resistance varieties in the particular area under biotic stress conditions necessitates evaluation of rice genotypes. The present study revealed significant fingerprinting variations observed among the 44 Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae isolates from Tella Hamsa genotype collected from different areas, Gagillapur and Kompally. In addition, much diverse pathotypic variation or virulence pattern was detected from set of differentials containing near isogenic lines and traditional cultivar differentials. Virulence data obtained from these differentials revealed that all of them were compatible with the resistance genes. However, these pathotypes were incompatible with the genes, xa-5, Xa-10, xa-13 and Xa-21 suggesting the possibility of deploying them for enhancing the resistance. Similar observations were reported in the research area of rice crop improvement. So, this study suggests the deployment of genes in combinations of two and three expressed wide spectrum of longevity resistance to bacterial blight pathogen.

N2  - The White-rumped Shama (Copsychus malabaricus) is an alien invasive species in Taiwan. The distribution and abundance of this species was estimated based on recorded observation of active birders, the database of 1988-2007 provided by the Chinese Wild Bird Federation, literature citation, a field survey conducted from 2006 to 2008 and an eradication project conducted from 2007 to 2008. This species was found primarily in the western hilly areas of Taiwan at elevations below 400 m. Since it was first recorded in the wild in 1988, it has bred in recent years resulting in confirmed sustainable feral populations in Taiwan. The population sizes of the species in Huben Village, Linnei Township, in Yunlin County remained low originally but the rate of increase steadily increased after 2005. However, the areas where this invasive feral population has established itself are still confined to southern and central-western Taiwan. Unlike earlier avian invaders in Taiwan, the White-rumped Shama has the ability to invade lowland natural forest areas. Therefore, it is recommended that proactive control management is executed at a time when their population is still limited in number and localized.

N2  - Bidens pilosa L. var. radiata Sch. Bip., a common weed in lowland Taiwan, is listed as one of the twenty most noxious invasive plants in Taiwan. In this study, we examined the effect of aqueous extracts of leaves, stems and roots of the invasive plant on germination and growth of seedlings (estimated by measuring the elongation of hypocotyls and radicals) of the same species and two other sympatric species, B. bipinnata and Ageraturem conyzoides. The objective of this study was to understand whether the aqueous tissue extracts affected the performance of the target species and whether these effects varied among tissue types and among target species. We found that the germination percentage of seeds of B. bipinnata was significantly reduced by root and leaf extracts, that of B. pilosa var. radiata was also significantly reduced by the application of root extract, while that of A. conyzoides was not affected by any of the three tissue extracts. The application of stem and leaf extracts inhibited the elongation of radicals of B. pilosa var. radiata, consequently, the growth of seedlings of this species was decreased in these two treatments. Though the elongation of hypocotyls was stimulated by leaf extract, the overall growth of seedlings of B. bipinnata was not affected by any tissue extract. In contrast, all three extracts stimulated the elongation of hypocotyls and radicals of A. conyzoides, consequently, the overall growth of seedlings of this plant was promoted by all three extracts. These results revealed that aqueous extracts from tissue of B. pilosa var. radiata had differential effect on the emergence and seedling growth of the three target species. The inhibition effect of its root and leaf extracts on the germination of B. bipinnata may partially explain the overwhelming dominance of B. pilosa var. radiata over B. bipinnata when they are sympatric.

N2  - New orchid related to Cheirostylis, Goodyera, Rhomboda and Zeuxine discovered in lowland central part of northern Vietnam is described in rank of separate genus Hayata. Proposed genus differs from Goodyera in 2 separate lateral stigmas; in not hairy hypochile; in massive, knob-like mesochile and in large 2-lobed, dentate epichile. It differs from Cheirostylis in large flowers with completely free sepals (newer forming tube); in peculiar bunches of capitate glands on lateral walls of hypochile and in not swollen succulent rhizome forming normal adventitious roots, not modified into ridges or pillows covered by root hairs. From Rhomboda discovered genus differs in absence of any keels on the lip; in specific papillae bunches inside hypochile and in not winged column. New genus may be also close to Zeuxine, from which it differs in plant habit, large flowers, large dentate lobes of epichile and in specific shape of stelidia and rostellar arms. Described plant not fits well with any genera of subtribe Goodyerinae and certainly desires generic segregation. Besides Vietnamese plant, described genus includes H. tabiyahanensis from Taiwan and H. sherriffii from Bhutan. Standard taxonomical treatment of new genus and key for its species identification is presented in the paper.

N2  - Three orchid species are newly recorded for the flora of Thailand. The discovery of Macodes petola in the southern part of Peninsular Thailand, adjacent to known occurrences across the Malaysian border, was expected. On the other hand, the find of Cheirostylis octodactyla in Thailand considerably extended the known range of this species to the west, as it was previously known only from the northern part of the Philippines, Taiwan and (through a single collection) from northern Vietnam. The recent discovery of populations of Zeuxine bidupensis in Thailand suggests that this species, hitherto considered endemic to Vietnam, does not only have morphological, but also geographic affintities to the little known Z. pantlingii from West Bengal.

N2  - Molecular analyses of ITS1 and trnL-F sequences confirmed that Fagaropsis falls in the same clade with Phellodendron, Tetradium, Toddalia, and Zanthoxylum, thus offering support for the 'proto-Rutaceae' hypothesis based on chemotaxonomic interpretation. On the other hand, Luvunga naturally fits in subfamily Aurantioideae. The results also indicate that Orixa is closer to Casimiroa and Skimmia, but not to Tetradium and Zanthoxylum.

N2  - Present study was carried out to evaluate antioxidant, photosynthetic and productivity of moss Racomitrium crispulum (Hook. f. et Wils.) Hook. f. et Wils. under various phytotoxic concentration of metals Cu and Cd for different days. Exogenous supplied Cu and Cd to R. crispulum significantly give stress on oxidative enzymes as well as on photosynthesis. After 15 days of treatment, the maximum decrease in NRA were 27% and 47% at 0.2 M concentration both in Cu and Cd treated moss is concomitant with the decrease in percent nitrogen and protein of the respective samples. A significant degradation of chlorophyll was 28% at 0.1 M Cd after 15 days. Increase in carotenoid content was noticed at low concentration of metals (0.01 M) attributed to photoprotective role of them. Carbohydrate content decreases 54% and 57% of Cu and Cd treated moss after 15 days showed their deleterious effect only after prolong period of incubation. Total sugar content is in inverse of carbohydrate to compensate the moss physiology. Peroxidase activity increased with the increase in treatment concentration, while it decreases with respect to increase in exposure time. The maximum peroxidase activity was observed is 11% at 10 mM treatment in 6 days Cu treated sample. The increase in SOD activity was observed under higher concentration and also concomitant with respect to increase in incubation period under both metal (Cu and Cd). Our findings and those of other cited herein suggested that under mild to moderate metal (Cu and Cd) stress for prolong period give inductive effect and also on photosynthates of moss R. crispulum. This further suggests that under every possible alteration, cell maintains their integrity and homeostasis by shuffling their metabolic and physiological responses. Present finding recommends that R. crispulum of Kumaon hills (India) is tolerant to Cu and Cd metal pollution and can be use as bioaccumulators for these two metals.

N2  - Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a low molecular weight lysophospholipid (LPL). Through binding to its specific G protein-coupled receptor family, LPA regulates various cellular functions, including proliferation, migration, invasion, and differentiation. Matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent protease and play important roles in regulating the interaction between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM). Among these MMPs, membrane type 1-metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) not only degrades ECM protein but also activates metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2, Gelatinase A), which are important to endothelial cell migration. Our previous study showed that LPA enhances MMP-2 expression and activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In this study, we further revealed that LPA also induce MT1-MMP mRNA and protein expressions in HUVECs through real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Furthermore, by applying chemical inhibitors, we found that LPA-induced MT1-MMP expression is mainly through a G(subscript i)- and partially through a G(subscript q)-dependent pathway. Our results provide new evidence that LPA might modulate ECM through regulating the expression of MT1-MMP.

N2  - Spaganium fallax and Schoenoplectus mucronatus subsp. robustus are emergent monocot plants dominating a subtropical mountainous lake, the Yuanyang Lake (YYL), in Taiwan. The photosynthetic pathways and the ecophysiology of these two species were studied in this study. I first analyzed δ^13C of fractions of S. fallax (submerged leaves and roots of seedlings, and submerged and emergent parts of leaves, and roots of mature plants) and S. mucronatus (emergent culms and roots of mature plants) to identify their photosynthetic pathway. I then investigated monthly variation in δ^13C and nitrogen content of emergent parts of the two species during 2003 to evaluate the integrated photosynthetic response. The leaf carbon isotope ratio of both emergent plants was within the range of most C3 plants indicating that they used C3 photosynthetic pathway. Similar pattern of seasonal variation in leaf nitrogen content and δ^13C values was found. Spring leaves (or culms in S. mucronatus) had significantly higher leaf nitrogen content and more positive δ^13C values than summer leaves (or culms). Consequently, there are significantly positive correlations between δ^13C and leaf nitrogen content in both species. The result suggests that changes in photosynthetic capacity might contribute to the seasonal variation in δ^13C in both species. In comparison between two species, S. fallax had significantly more positive δ^13C and higher leaf nitrogen content than S. mucronatus during most of the sampling months. The higher leaf nitrogen content found in S. fallax might also contribute to its more positive δ^13C values than S. mucronatus.

N2  - Adrenal medulla chromaffin cells are stimulated by acetylcholine released from sympathetic preganglionic neurons and secret catecholamines into the blood to accommodate short-term stress. Acetylcholine activates nicotinic and muscarinic receptors to elevate the intracellular Ca(superscript 2+) concentration and causes the secretion of catecholamines. Lysophospholipids in the serum, including sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), are released primarily from immune cells during blood clotting and infection to modulate various physiological activities. To characterize the effects of lysophospholipids on Ca(superscript 2+) responses in bovine chromaffin cells, cells were loaded with the Ca(superscript 2+) indicator fura-2, and fluorescence intensity was used to monitor changes in intracellular Ca(superscript 2+) concentration. Cells treated with 1 μM S1P or LPA for 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60 min were stimulated with acetylcholine (100 μM), muscarine (100 μM), DMPP (10 μM), or high K(superscript +) buffer (50 mM KCl) for 5 sec. The results showed that the Ca(superscript 2+) responses evoked by acetylcholine were significantly inhibited after incubation in LPA or S1P for 20 min. The Ca(superscript 2+) response evoked by high K(superscript +) buffer was not inhibited by S1P pretreatment and was significantly facilitated by LPA pretreatment. Muscarine-evoked Ca(superscript 2+) responses were slightly attenuated by LPA and S1P pretreatments. Nicotine-evoked responses were inhibited in both LPA- and S1P-pretreated cells. Our findings demonstrate that nicotinic receptors may be the main targets of lysophospholipids in inhibiting acetylcholine-evoked Ca(superscript 2+) responses.

The botanical description of this new record with color plates and a key to the two Ceriops species in Singapore are provided. It is noteworthy that C. tagal (Perr.) C. B. Rob. is rarer than C. zippeliana in Singapore. Thus, special attention for conservation should be focused on C. tagal and a further survey of this genus would provide valuable information to better manage Singapore’s mangrove plant biodiversity.

N2  - Since insufficient materials of Thismia taiwanensis were collected in the past, the structural details of the annulus, stamens and other characters of this critically endangered species have not been examined. The aim of this study was to determine the characteristics of flowers and fruits, especially those of the perianth tube and stamens, using fresh material. Seed surfaces were photographed by using scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the flowers of T. taiwanensis were found either without a pedicel or with an elongated pedicel that becomes carnose in the fruit stage. The latter was more common. The perianth is not covered with glands; there are six stamens, which are separate and opposite the perianth lobes, with dilated, ribbon-like connectives, pendulous from annulus. The seeds are ellipsoid to fusiform, with somewhat tapering poles, 0.2-0.4×0.1-0.15 mm, and with epidermal cells that are raised, with distinctly longitudinal anticlinal walls and sunken anticlinal boundaries, forming a superficial network pattern.

N2  - Pyrenomycete species of Cercophora and Podospora are common on the dung of herbivores. Schizothecium was differentiated from Podospora based on morphological characters and further supported by molecular phylogenetic analyses. This study focused on phylogenetic relationships of Cercophora and Podospora including species of Schizothecium. Two gene sequences, ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS/5.8S rDNA) and a fragment of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD), were amplified and examined using maximum-parsimony and Bayesian analyses. In all analyses, Cercophora and Podospora were found to be polyphyletic, each consisting of a group of morphologically heterogeneous and phylogenetically distant species. Species of Schizothecium were all located in one clade and two Cercophora species with similar perithecial hair structures formed a sister group to it. The recognition of Shizotheium is reconfirmed. The phylogeny indicated a relevant relationship with the perithecial morphology in the Lasiosphariaceae.

N2  - Prevention and therapy of thrombotic diseases have attracted much attention in developed countries during recent years. Investigators have been looking for cheaper and safer thrombolytic agents for therapy of thrombotic diseases. Recently, we have discovered a fibrinolytic protease from Schizophyllum commune. In this study, the protease was proven to degrade blood clot effectively. Seven divalent metal ions were used to test the selectiveness on enhancing protease activity. The treated rat blood was traced by thromboelastography to assess the viscoelastic properties of whole blood. As the result, fibrinolytic activity of the protease was enhanced remarkably by Mg(superscript 2+) in reducing the strength of blood clot and showed the innovative anti-thrombotic effects. This is the first study of anti-thrombotic effects from fungal-derived fibrinolytic protease using thromboelastography and delineates the efficacy of magnesium supplementation in enhancement of thrombolytic activity from S. commune fibrinolytic protease.

N2  - The abundance, dominance and growth performance of Parthenium hysterophorus in relation to its field associates in extensively large areas was investigated. The preliminary analysis of the data revealed that P. hysterophorus is a weak or poor competitor and hence it fails to grow in the company of any aggressive species. Senna uniflora and a few other plants were identified for the control of this pernicious weed. The ability of other species to control P. hysterophorus was attributed to allelopathy. In order to understand how Hyptis suaveolens and Senna uniflora are capable of arresting the growth of P. hysterophorus, pot culture experiments in de Wit replacement series, field experiments in experimental plots and experimental manipulation of the competitive species under natural conditions during different seasons were carried out for two years in 2004 and 2005. The results clearly revealed that both H. suaveolens and S. uniflora were highly effective in the management of P. hysterophorus. The results further showed that the physical dominance and the ability of the competitive species to deprive P. hysterophorus of light are mainly responsible for the decline of P. hysterophorus. Allelopathy doesn't seem to play any effective role under natural conditions.

N2  - Naturalized flora of Taiwan has been increasing in the past six after the first catalogue was compiled in 2002. In order to probe into the increasing pattern behind this dramatic growth of potential invaders, we compiled and evaluated newly added naturalized species in a quest for better understanding. Furthermore, naturalized species shared with neighboring regions, such as Mainland China and Japan, were estimated as well. The results revealed that two-thirds of these newly recruited species naturalized before 2002, and only 77 actually naturalized after 2002. The proportion of naturalized flora in the native species pool increased from 8% to 12%. The compositions, origins, and life forms of these potential invaders before and after 2002 were similar with slight fluctuations presented in the ranks of the dominant families. Number of species shared with neighboring regions multiplied due to the fast growth of the naturalized flora in Taiwan; nevertheless, the number might be understated due to the inaccessibility of the latest naturalized floras from neighboring regions. The doubled flora of naturalized species in the past six years implies insufficient attention to plant invasions and lag phases of invasion. The expansion of naturalized flora in Taiwan also increased the pools of naturalized species shared with neighboring areas, including Mainland China and Japan.

N2  - Many studies described relationships between plant species and intrinsic or exogenous factors, but few quantified spatial scales of species patterns. In this study, quantitative methods were used to explore the spatial scale of understory species (including resident and transient species), in order to identify the influential factors of species distribution. Resident species (including herbaceous species, climbers and tree ferns ＜ 1 m high) were investigated on seven transects, each 5-meter wide and 300-meter long, at Lanjenchi plot in Nanjenshan Reserve, southern Taiwan. Transient species (seedling of canopy, subcanopy and shrub species ＜ 1 cm diameter at breast height) were censused in three of the seven transects. The herb coverage and seedling abundance were calculated for each 5 × 5 m quadrat along the transects, and Moran's I and Galiano's new local variance (NLV) indices were then used to identify the spatial scale of autocorrelation for each species. Patterns of species abundance of understory layer varied among species at fine scale within 50 meters. Resident species showed a higher proportion of significant autocorrelation than the transient species. Species with large size or prolonged fronds or stems tended to show larger scales in autocorrelation. However, dispersal syndromes and fruit types did not relate to any species' spatial patterns. Several species showed a significant autocorrelation at a 180-meter class which happened to correspond to the local replicates of topographical features in hilltops. The spatial patterns of understory species at Lanjenchi plot are mainly influenced by species’ intrinsic traits and topographical characteristics.

N2  - Rhododendron farrerae Tate ex Sweet was first recorded in Taiwan by Kawakami in 1910. Since then, this species has been grouped with R. tashiroi Maxim. due to insufficient reports and specimens, and was eliminated from Flora of Taiwan in 1998. By examining all the specimens preserved in Taiwan herbaria and documents, we confirm that the native population of R. farrerae is actually distributed in southern Taiwan, ranging from Peitawushan to Tajen Township, in the southern part of the Central Mountain Range. The diagnostic character distinguishing R. farrerae from R. tashiroi and R. mariesii Hemsl. & E. H. Wils. is that R. tashiroi and R. mariesii bear 2-3 flowers from each bud at anthesis; in contrast, R. farrerae bears only one flower during the flowering period. We provide in this paper a detailed taxonomic treatment, morphological description, distribution map, line drawing, and a comparison table of these three species of Taiwan, together with photographs.

N2  - Investigations on the Himalayan genus Pedicularis L. revealed rich concentration and enormous diversity of species in the Sikkim Himalayas. Out of the 83 Indian species of Pedicularis, 49 species (ca. 59%) are found in the Sikkim Himalayas and 34 species (ca. 41%) are endemic. The Sikkim Himalayas may therefore be designated as the 'megadiversity centre' of Pedicularis L. in India.

N2  - Galium, comprising about 300 or 400 species in the world, is a large genus of the family Rubiaceae. Ten taxa were recorded in the 2(superscript nd) edition of Flora of Taiwan. In the course of our botanical inventory, Galium paradoxum Maxim., heretofore unknown in Taiwan, was collected from southern part of the island. This species can be characterized by its opposite leaves on lower parts and 4 - (or 5) - verticillate leaves (2 larger, others often reduced into stipule-like) on upper parts of stem, distinct 3-10mm long petiole and ovate to widely ovate leaves. In this report we provide a description, line drawings, and colored photographs taken from the wild to aid in identification.

N2  - The rich biodiversity repository of Gandhamardan hill ranges, Eastern Ghats, India is under severe threat from various magnitudes such as deforestation, unsustainable collection of medicinal plants, invasion of alien species, forest fire, urbanization and habitat destruction. The Protected Forests (PFs) have lost a number of wild species from their natural habitat pose to loss of biodiversity. The hill range having two preservation plots of 100ha each identified in Nrusinghanath (SITE-I) and Harishankar (SITE-Ⅱ) range as study area. The present study inventoried a total of 10775 trees belonging to 91 tree species within a 17.6 hectare sampled area (441 plots). The predominant tree species are Diospyros melanoxylon, Madhuca indica, Cleistanthus collinus, Anogeissus latifolia, and Lagerstroemia parviflora. The Shannon-Weiner index (H') is 3.92 (SITE-Ⅰ) and 3.31 (SITE-Ⅱ) with Simpson's value 1.0. This value indicates that the tropical moist deciduous forests are also species diverse systems. Mean stand density was 671 ha^(-1) in SITE^(-1) and 565 ha^(-1) in SITE-II. Stem density and species richness have consistently decreased with increasing girth class of tree species from 50 cm girth. The present study on phyto-diversity of tree species and participatory approaches on sustainable use of natural resources will provide the baseline information for effective and sustainable biodiversity conservation of tropical moist deciduous forest.

N2  - Understanding species distributions is essential for developing biodiversity conservation strategies. We combined two bird inventories conducted from 1993 to 2004 and identified specific features of 17 endemic bird species in Taiwan. We used eight environmental variables, including elevation, annual total precipitation, annual mean temperature, warmth index, percentage of forest cover, mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), percentage of building area, and road density, to define macrohabitat characteristics of each species. All the data were in a 1 × 1 km gird system. The 17 species were classified as common (being present in more than 200 grids), uncommon (100–200 grids) or rare (less than 100 grids). The Mikado Pheasant (Syrmaticus mikado), as a rare species, had the lowest occurrence records, while the Taiwan Barbet (Megalaima nuchalis), as a common species, had the highest. Each species had a specific distribution range and habitat preference. These 17 species occupied heterogeneous elevation and climatic conditions. In general, they favored habitats with high vegetation cover, at almost full forest cover and median to high NDVI. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that elevation had the highest correlations with species distributions, with axis 1 accounting for 57.5% of the variation and axis 2 for 9.8%. The endemic species in Taiwan could be classified into three groups mainly separated by elevation based on the CCA. Potential biodiversity hotspots, in the elevation range of 300 and 1500 m with 45%-100% forest cover, included 33.2% areas of Taiwan. Only 35% of actual hotspots (grid with the number of endemic species ≧7) were located in the potential hotspots. Most of the actual hotspots (65%) occur at higher elevation than the potential hotspots. These data demonstrated the distribution patterns of the endemic bird species in Taiwan, and topography and vegetation are the most important macrohabitat factors associated with these species.

N2  - This study described the diatoms appeared in the sediments of Liyu Lake, a lowland natural lake situated at Hualen, eastern Taiwan. A total of 50 species was found in the sediments of this eutrophic lake. In them, 8 species were reported for the first time in Taiwan. They are: Cymbella thienemannii, Navicula absoluta, Navicula bacillum, Frustulia rhomboides var. crassinervia, Gyrosigma procerum, Nitzschia paleacea Epithemia smithii and Eunotia subarcuatioides. The ultrastructures of each species were described on the basis of observations under a scanning electron microscope. The ecological implications of the occurrence of these diatom species in this lake were inferred.

N2  - The genus Ranunculus L. in India is taxonomically revised, based on morphological and phytogeographacial patterns. Forty-five taxa (41 species and 4 varieties) of Ranunculus have been recognized, of these, the taxonomic complexicity among the Ranunuculs cantoniensis DC., R. diffusus DC., R. hyperboreus Rottb. and R. pulchellus C.A. Mey. have been resolved in this treatment, and also several taxa were treated as synonymous to these species by the earlier workers, have been segregated either as infra-specific taxa or were merged under the species proper. Efforts have been made to check and study each and every taxon of Ranunculus known from India, represented in all the Indian and European herbaria and from the literature. Sixteen species of Ranunculus show a very meager representation in the herbaria and in the field as well. The present work also includes the lectotypification of eight species (article submitted for publication). A key to the species, nomenclatural citation of each species, their synonyms, details of type, taxonomic description, phenology, distribution in India and worldwide, exsiccata, ecological and taxonomical notes if any, have been provided. Line drawings of the habit and details of each species have been drawn wherever possible, based on the availability of the materials. The distribution of all the species in India has been shown on the maps.

N2  - Gnetalean megafossils were accumulated in the last decade. Taxonomic positions of several of Ephedran megafossil species are, however, controversial, resulting in a complicated nomenclature. Liaoxia Z.Y. Cao & S.Q. Wu, ”Eragrostis Z.Y. Cao & S.Q. Wu”, ”Chaoyangia Duan”, and their type species ”Liaoxia cheniae Z.Y. Cao & S.Q. Wu”, ”Eragrostis changii Z.Y. Cao & S.Q. Wu”, ”Chaoyangia liangii S.Y. Duan”, were not validly published in the original publication under the Vienna Code. The species ”Liaoxia cheniae Z.Y. Cao & S.Q. Wu” was validly published as Ephedrites cheniae S.X. Guo & X.W. Wu but later combined into Liaoxia cheniae (S.X. Guo & X.W. Wu) Z.Y. Cao & S.Q. Wu and further into Ephedra cheniae (S.X. Guo & X.W. Wu) H.M. Liu et al. Some uncertain morphological characters are fundamental to elucidate the taxonomic position of Ephedrites cheniae S.X. Guo & X.W. Wu and ”Chaoyangia liangii S.Y. Duan”, e.g. bract number, position, and connation in female cones, seed number and position in a female cone, and morphology of the furcated appendages of reproductive organs of ”Chaoyangia liangii S.Y.

N2  - Tree seedlings play an important role in forest regeneration. To understand the factors that control seedling establishment, we (1) compared the composition patterns of tree seedlings and their corresponding overstories, (2) examined the relationships between seedling composition and environmental factors and (3) evaluated the interaction (competition or facilitation) between seedlings and herbaceous layer in a wind-stressed forest in Nanjenshan, southern Taiwan. In the study plot, seedling abundance of canopy, subcanopy and shrub species (with true leaves and ＜1 cm diameter at breast height) and coverage of herbaceous species (including herbaceous species, climbers and tree ferns ≤ca. 1 m in height) were investigated on three transects with a total of 180 contiguous 5×5 m quadrats. Clustering classification and ordination methods were used to reveal the tree seedling composition patterns and the relationships between seedling composition and environmental factors. Correlation coefficients were computed between herbaceous coverage and seedling abundance among herb-seedling species pairs and between tall (≥1 m high)/short (＜0.5 m high) herbs and seedlings pairs to test the herb-seedling interaction. The spatial distribution of tree seedlings presented a perfect match to the overstory vegetation pattern. There was a strong relationship among seedling composition, herbaceous composition and topographic features, especially exposure to monsoon winds. Because of the absence of strong correlations between herbaceous structure/species and seedling abundances, the strong linkage in spatial patterns between seedling and herbaceous compositions suggests that certain plant species in the study plot have similar responses to the monsoon exposure. Our results also indicated that seedlings ＜1 cm in diameter were strongly influenced by wind stress, similar to the response of the overstory composition, and that the facilitative/competitive effects of the herbaceous layer on tree seedlings were relatively weak.

N2  - The present paper reports a newly recorded Asarum, A. satsumense F. Maekawa, collected from Taiwan. This species was for merely recorded as an endemic species in Kagoshima, southern Kyushu, Japan. However, recently it was found in northwestern Taiwan, Miaoli and Taichung Counties. Asarum satsumense resembles A. macranthum Hook. f. of Taiwan, but can be distinguished by having a more depressed pyriform perianth tube, larger perianth tube entrance, tessellate-reticulate apically but longitudinally thick-ridged basally inner surface of perianth tube (vs. tessellate throughout the inner wall), and denser supratectate warts on pollen grains. Taxonomic description, line drawing, pollen SEM plates, chromosome number, distribution information, and color photographs of floral characters of this newly recorded species are provided to aid its identification.

N2  - This study examined the feasibility of using ultrasonic treatment to investigate the adhesion and growth of the green alga Scenedesmus acutus. The number of S. acutus cells in a colony ranged from one to eight, with a median of four. The percentages of 1-and 2-cell colonies increased with the duration of sonication. Although unaffected by a short-term (30 s) sonication, the ratio of colony formation of S. acutus on agar plates was significantly decreased by extended (60 s) sonication. Additionally, short-term sonication was effective in detaching adhered algal cells from the test tube wall without adversely affecting their growth, implying its potential usefulness in monitoring the growth of S. acutus. S. acutus cells adhered to the test tube wall within several hours, with the ratio of adhered cells reaching the maximum level (ca. 90 %) within 24 h. At 25℃, the cells usually adhered to the test tube wall rapidly including the conditions at which the growth of S. acutus was suppressed, such as a low nutrient concentration and weak irradiance. However, adhesion proceeded slowly at 15℃, implying that temperature is essential to regulating the adhesion of S. acutus.

N2  - The Rukai tribe is concentrated in the Wutai Township of Pingtung County, southern Taiwan. From 2000 to 2003 people of the Rukai in Wutai were interviewed on the traditional uses of plants and samples of such plant species were collected in an effort to remedy the situation of insufficient quantitative data on Taiwan's ethnobotany. The number of citations per species and total number of citations were recorded in order to calculate diversity indices such as Shannon-Wiener index, evenness index, and rarefaction curves. Thirty-seven interviewed informants cited 245 plant species, which were then classified into thirteen types of usages, such as food, medicine, tools, and decoration. Among the 245 plant species, 93 species are used as food, 73 as tools, 52 for decoration and 45 for medicinal purposes. Informants described six types of usages for Hibiscus taiwanensis Hu and Vitex negundo L. Sambucus chinensis Nakai and Chamaesyce hirta (L.) Millsp. had the highest number of citations for medicinal usages. The Shannon-Wiener index was 2.27. The evenness values was 0.95, showing that the Wutai Rukai people had a low dominance concerning the uses of a few species and an equitability of plant uses. The diversity indices and the Coleman rarefaction curves of the Taiwan Rukai tribe could be available to compare ethnobotanical data with different areas.

N2  - It has been shown that three wild soybean species, Glycine soja, G. tomentella and G. tabacina, in Taiwan had different response to root-zone salinity and differences in leaf accumulation of Na and K might be responsible for the response. To further understand the mechanisms in relation to the differences among species in leaf accumulation of Na, K and Ca, in this study I compared the distribution of Na, K, and Ca not only in leaves but also in roots and calculated the sum of the ion contents in leaf and root (=ion content in roots +ion content in leaves) of the three soybean species receiving four different levels of NaCl treatments, 0, 17, 51 and 85 mM. Analysis of contents of K and Na in leaves and roots revealed that G. soja, the most sensitive species, and G. tomentella, the most tolerance species had similar sum of root and leaf Na contents under the same NaCl treatment, however, the former had significantly high leaf Na content than the later. G. tabacina, the medium sensitive species, had the least sum of root Na and leaf Na contents and medium leaf Na content. In G. soja, increasing accumulation of Na in leaves with increasing treatment NaCl concentration might hamper the uptake of K in roots resulting in decreases in the sum of K contents in roots and leaves. There is no evidence that salinity could impair Ca uptake in the three wild soybean species. These results suggest that differential sensitivity to root-zone salinity among the three species is mainly due to their differential ability to control the allocation of salt away from leaves and to some extent restrict Na uptake at root level.

N2  - As part of All India Coordinated Research Project on Taxonomy of orchids (AICOPTAX) Chotanagpur Plateau was surveyed extensively for documentation of orchid species and distribution during 2002-2006. Sixty three species were collected from the study area with Dendrobium as one of the largest group of epiphytic orchids comprising of 11 species, namely, Dendrobium aphyllum, D. bicameratum, D. cucullatum, D. crepidatum, D. formosum, D. fimbriatum, D. herbaceum, D. moschatum, D. peguanum, D. regium and D. transparens. Most of the species were found in the Sal (Shorea robusta) dominated forests. Stratified Random Sampling was used for ecological studies in the forested regions on the plateau. Results show that D. aphyllum was the most common amongst 11 species and it was distributed through out the altitudinal gradient, whereas, rest of the orchid species were found to be localised at comparatively higher altitudes. D. herbaceum was always found on the upper areas of the plateaus between 900-1000 m asl. D. crepidatum was seen in both epiphytic as well as lithophytic conditions, whereas D. moschatum were found growing as lithophytes along the streams. Rest of the species were epithytic. The paper also deals with some microhabitat features governing the distribution of these orchids on the plateau along with their key for identification.

N2  - Lecanorchis betongensis, a new species from tropical rain forest in southern peninsular Thailand, is described and illustrated. The combination of semicircular column wings and a labellum with an odd number of major veins (but devoid of calli) places the new species in sect. Lecanorchis. However, the lack of any fusion between the labellum and the column readily distinguishes L. betongensis from all other species of the genus. The new species seems morphologically closest to L. malaccensis from Thailand, Malaysia and Sumatra.

N2  - Many bird species, for example Crested Serpent Eagle (Spilornis cheela hoya), Collared Scops Owl (Otus bakkamoena), Tawny Fish Owl (Ketupa flavipes), Crested Goshawk (Accipiter trivirgatus), Grass Owl (Tyto longimembris), etc., are monomorphic, which is difficult to identify their sex simply by their outward appearance. Especially for those monomorphic endangered species, finding an effective tool to identify their sex beside outward appearance is needed for further captive breeding programs or other conservation plans. In this study, we collected samples of Crested Serpent Eagle, Collared Scops Owl, Tawny Fish Owl, Crested Goshawk, and Grass Owl, five protected monomorphic species in Taiwan, as well as Black Swan (Cygmus atratus) and Nicobar Pigeon (Caloenas nicobarica), two aviary introduced monomorphic species served as a control group. We used sex-specific primers of avian CHD1 (chromo-helicase-DNA-binding) gene and EE0.6 (EcoRI 0.6-kb fragment) sequences to identify the sex of these birds. The results showed that CHD1 gene primers could be used to correctly identify the sex of Black Swans, Nicobar Pigeons and Crested Serpent Eagles, but it could not be used to correctly identify sex in Collared Scops Owls, Tawny Fish Owls, and Crested Goshawks. In the sex identification using EE0.6 sequence fragments, A, C, D and E primer sets could be used for sexing Black Swans; A, B, C, and D primer sets could be used for sexing Crested Serpent Eagles; and E primer set could be used for sexing Nicobar Pigeons and the two owl species. Correct determination of sex is the first step if a captive breeding measure is required. We have demonstrated that several of the existing primer sets can be used for sex determination of several captive breeding and indigenous bird species.

N2  - Diversity, phytogeography and conservation status of Sri Lankan tree-ferns are discussed in this paper. The family Cyatheaceae is represented by eight taxa (seven species and one doubtful variety) in Sri Lanka with a high rate of endemism of 75%. Apart from Cyathea walkerae and C. gigantea, the other species are restricted to geographically isolated areas in the country with limited population sizes. Fortunately, all Sri Lankan species of Cyathea occur within the protected areas of the wet zone. However, ex situ conservation is limited to C. walkerae and C. crinita at Botanic Gardens in Hakgala. Despite the family being listed in Annex II of CITES, its species have not yet been assessed in Sri Lanka for the Red Listing criteria. Identification of the nature and level of threat to Sri Lankan Cyathea species is therefore a major priority, followed by the monitoring of populations in situ in protected areas in the wet zone. Ex situ conservation of rare species and cultivation of Cyathea species from spores have also been identified as priority areas. A strong programme should be developed with the National Herbarium to explore little known forest patches in the wet zone to enhance our knowledge of Cyathea species in Sri Lanka. Such information will provide a strong basis for preparing a conservation and management plan for tree-ferns in the country.

N2  - While revising the genus ”Corydalis” (Fumariaceae) occurring in the Kashmir Himalaya, ”Corydalis amarnathiana” Dar, Semi & Naqshi is described and illustrated as a new species. This new species is allied to ”C. thyrsiflora Prain” and ”C. pakistanica Jafri”, but can be easily differentiated from them in having only one (shorter and less robust) stem; lower cauline leaves with petioles basally sheathing to half their length, upper cauline leaves forming a whorl; and racemes short and only 5-15(-18)-flowered. It also resembles ”C. shakyae Lidén” in stem characters, but can be easily distinguished from it by the presence of 2-3-pinnatisect leaves, smaller and broader ultimate leaf-segments, and 12-14 mm long flowers.

N2  - We studied the home ranges and core areas of a native population of Crested Serpent-eagles in southern Taiwan by radio-tracking from November 2005 to May 2007. Mean home range areas for eight male and six female individuals were 16.65 km^2 and 6.93 km^2 based on the estimation by the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method and 4.52 km^2 and 1.46 km^2 based on the 95% fixed kernel (FK) method, respectively. Mean core areas for males and females were 1.16 km^2 and 0.36 km^2 based on the estimation by the Area Independent Method (AIM) and 0.64 km^2 and 0.20 km^2 based on the 50% FK method, respectively. Mean fixed kernel home ranges of males were 3.1 times greater than those of females, and AIM core areas of males were 3.2 times greater than those of females. All of the individuals exhibited core area overlap, especially in the case of male to male core areas. Male to male, male to female and female to female average AIM core area overlap was 37.0%, 14.9% and 1.9%, respectively with these differences all being statistically significant. Therefore, at the level of AIM core area overlap, core areas of females were smaller, and female to female relationships showed considerably more range exclusivity than those of male to female and male to male. In contrast, male core areas were more regularly shared with other male or female individuals. Since radio-tracked females were 18% heavier than radio-tracked males, we discuss how the differences in spacing pattern may be caused by female dominance.

N2  - Mosses are remarkably successful colonizer on the variety of habitats. They can survive in extreme environmental conditions where only a few other plants grow. The main attributes of mosses are compact growth form, ability to retain moisture, ectohydric nature, poikilohydry and low growing habit. The occurrence of a particular species may reflect the microclimate of the locality. The present study reveals 75 species of acrocarpous mosses belonging to 23 genera and nine families from Imphal district which is an urban site of tropical climate. The most frequently occurring family is observed to be Pottiaceae with 28 species and 11 genera. The genus Bryum with 13 species is found to have highest number of species followed by Fissidens and Physcomitrium. Splachnobryum sp. and Bryum argenteum are found to be distributed on the nitrophilous substrata. It seems that changing climatic conditions and pollution are restricting the sexual reproduction and subsequently the genetic variability and adaptability in the moss taxa.

N2  - Well differentiated gametophytes of Philonotis thwaitesii Mitt., an acrocarpous moss and Brachythecium plumosum (Hedw.) B.S.G., a pleurocarpous moss have been raised in vitro by inoculating their spores into a range of concentrations of inorganic media. Half-strength Knop's macronutrients + Nitsch's trace elements with 10 ppm ferric citrate was found the most suitable for growth and multiplication of these species in continuous light of 4,000-5,500lux and at 21±2ºC temperature. Protonemal buds developed on caulonema in P. thwaitesii while on chloronema in B. plumosum. Sucrose stimulated caulonemal differentiation, abundant rhizoid production and a few but much robust gametophyte development. Emergence of hyaline rhizoids like filaments has been observed in P. thwaitesii upon contact of gametophores with solid substratum while true rhizoids all along the length of gametophytes of B. plumosum emerges upon placing them horizontally on culture medium. Variable growth forms (weft-like branched as well as erect unbranched habit) have been observed in both species in culture conditions. Sub-culturing of P. thwaitesii gave rise to new population via passing through chloronemal and caulonemal stage while B. plumosum directly regenerated into new gametophytes by-passing protonemal stage. In vitro raised plants were acclimatized and transferred to soil in order to their further proliferation.

N2  - A checklist of all species of Ficus L. available in the present political boundary of India is provided. About 115 taxa (89 species and 26 infraspecific taxa) of Ficus have been recorded here based on all available information. The taxa have been arranged according to the current classification among six subgenera and 12 sections. The maximum number of the species belongs to subgenera Urostigma. For each species, correct nomenclature with first citation followed by several relevant works and important synonyms has been provided along with Indian as well as world distribution. The taxonomic comments have also been provided for many species, if found necessary. Out of the 115 taxa occurring in India, only 10 taxa have been recorded as endemic. One new combination Ficus hirta Vahl subsp. triloba (Buch.-Ham. ex Voigt) Chaudhary has been proposed. In India, the species are distributed throughout the country from South to North up to the Himalayas at about 2,000 m elevations. The maximum diversity of the species lies in the North-East region followed by the Peninsular region and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The province like Meghalaya in the North-East region has very rich diversity of Ficus as far as the number of species is concerned.

N2  - This study was conducted to determine taxonomical features and antimicrobial activities of 156 isolates of endophytic fungi collected from twigs of medicinal plants of Lauraceae (67 isolates) and Rutaceae (89 isolates) in central and northern Taiwan. The 156 isolates of fungi were classified into 35 genera in 19 families based on morphological characteristics of mycelia and asexual/sexual spores, as well as molecular phylogenetic analysis of rDNA LSU D1/D2 and ITS regions. The most common endophytes were in the taxa of Colletotrichum, Guignardia, Hypoxylon, Nigrospora, Phomopsis and Xylaria, and the most common hosts were Citrus and Zanthoxylum of Rutaceae and Cinnamomum of Lauraceae. Molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that xylariaceous isolates could be separated into Xylaria and Hypoxylon groups based on rDNA of LSU D1/D2 and ITS regions. Four isolates of endophytic fungi including Lasmenia sp. isolate CB10, Ophioceras tenuisporum isolate CI02, Xylaria cubensis isolate LA04 and Cyanodermella sp. isolate TR09 were tested for antimicrobial activities using a dual culture method and Lasmenia sp. isolate CB10 and Cyanodermella sp. isolate TR09 showed better antimicrobial activity against 12 plant pathogens including 9 fungi and 3 bacteria. Spraying Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa) plants with culture filtrates of the endophytic fungus Lasmenia sp. isolate CB10 significantly reduced severity of anthracnose of Chinese cabbage caused by Colletotrichum higginsianum under greenhouse conditions. This study suggests that the Lasmenia sp. isolate CB10 may be of potential for  management of anthracnose of Chinese cabbage.

N2  - Treelines have been found to be lower in small isolated hilltops, but the specific dynamics behind this unique phenomenon are unknown. This study investigates the distribution patterns of woody plants in Yangmingshan National Park (YMSNP), Northern Taiwan in search of the limitation mechanisms unique to small isolated hills, and to evaluate potential threats under global warming. Forests distributed between 200 to 900 m above sea level (ASL). Remnant forest fragments between 400 and 900 m ASL, have the highest species richness, and should be protected to ensure future forest recovery from the former extensive artificial disturbance. The lower boundary is threatened by urban and agricultural development. The lack of native woody species in these low elevation zones may cause a gap susceptible to invasive species. A consistent forest line at 100 m below mountain tops regardless of elevation suggests a topography-induced instead of an elevation-related limiting mechanism. Therefore, upward-shift of forests, caused by global warming, might be limited at 100 m below hilltops in small isolated hills because of topography-related factors. The spatial range of woody plants along the altitudinal gradient, thus, is likely to become narrower under the combined pressures of global warming, limited elevation, exposure-related stress, and artificial disturbance. Management priorities for forest recovery are suggested to include preservation of remnant forest fragments, increasing forest connectivity, and increasing seedling establishment in the grasslands.

N2  - Studies of West Malesian material of the genus Agrostophyllum reveals that three previously described species should be treated as new synonyms of earlier named entities, namely A. arundinaceum Ridl. (= A. cyathiforme J.J.Sm.), A. mearnsii Ames (= A. globiceps Schltr.) and A. wenzelii Ames (= A. glumaceum Hook.f.). However A. formosanum Rolfe is found to be a good species, distinct from A. inocephalum (Schauer) Rchb.f. On the other hand five new taxa have been recognised and are proposed here, namely A. asahanense, A. boeeanum, A. galeandrae, A. maliauense and A. pseudolaxum.

N2  - In the present study, habitat, distribution and regeneration of Commiphora wightii (Arn.) Bhandari (Burseraceae) was explored in Rajasthan, India, to support conservation actions. Twenty-six sites were identified for sampling the populations of C. wightii in the desert region and in Aravallis. Commiphora wightii prefers rocky substratum and grows in shallow, gravelly, unfertile soils, hilly terrains and under open canopies. The number of saplings was only 5.68 % as compared to its adult population. Population densities of C. wightii were 25 stems ha^-1 in desert and 40 stems ha^-1 in Aravallis of Rajasthan, India. Over-exploitation, narrow extent of occurrence, small area of occupancy, severe fragmentation of populations, very low regeneration and invasion of alien species to its habitat revealed that C. wightii is facing severe conservation threat and extinction risk. It should be prioritized for ”endangered category” by ensuring the habitat conservation, sustainable utilization and cultivation of this economically important species.

N2  - In this first study on the pollen rain in natural forest in Taiwan using pollen traps, the dispersal patterns of airborne pollen were determined, with emphasis on Fagus hayatae and some major plant species, and the relationship between pollen assemblages and vegetation was elucidated. Seventeen pollen traps were installed on the western slope of Mt. Takai, northern Taiwan, from March 21 to May 10, 2008. Pollen and spores belonging to 37 families and 43 genera were identified. The results of correspondence analysis suggested differentiation of three vertical zones of pollen assemblages that corresponded to three vegetation types. Three patterns of occurrence were identified for the major pollen taxa, namely ubiquitous occurrence, local occurrence, and peak occurrence. The pollen influx of F. hayatae, a taxon characterized by local occurrence, was remarkably lower at a distance of over 200 m away from the pure stands. This suggests that pollen-mediated gene flow between the beech populations in Taiwan is unlikely. Besides providing basic data on the pollen dispersal of some important taxa in the middle altitudes of Taiwan, the present study also points out that caution should be taken in interpreting pollen percentage data from sediments.

N2  - For the study of the macroecology and conservation of Taiwan's birds, there was an urgent need to develop distribution models of bird species whose distribution had never before been modeled. Therefore, we here model the distributions of 27 mostly rare and cryptic breeding bird species using a statistical approach which has been shown to be especially reliable for modeling species with a low sample size of presence localities, namely the maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling technique. For this purpose, we began with a dedicated attempt to collate as much high-quality distributional data as possible, assembling databases from several scientific reports, contacting individual data recorders and searching publicly accessible database, the internet and the available literature. This effort resulted in 2022 grid cells of 1 × 1 km size being associated with a presence record for one of the 27 species. These records and 10 pre-selected environmental variables were then used to model each species' probability distribution which we show here with all grid cells below the lowest presence threshold being converted to zeros. We then in detail discuss the interpretation and applicability of these distributions, whereby we pay close attention to habitat requirements, the intactness and fragmentation of their habitat, the general detectability of the species and data reliability. This study is another one in an ongoing series of studies which highlight the usefulness of using large electronic databases and modern analytical methods to help with the monitoring and assessment of Taiwan's bird species.

N2  - How micro-topography affecting plant communities classification and species composition at one stand-level was investigated through the plant communities and species composition varied across fine-scale environmental heterogeneity at the 25-ha Lienhuachih broad-leaved forest dynamics plot (FDP). All free-standing woody plants with diameter at breast height ≧ 1 cm were identified, measured, tagged and mapped. Four plant communities were identified and represented with dominant and indicating species based on two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). Type I, Pasania nantoensis - Randia cochinchinensis, locating on the ridge and the highest elevation was with the highest stem density; Type II, Mallotus paniculatus - Engelhardtia roxburghiana, locating on the upper slope was an ecotone between type I and type III, with the middle stem density and basal area among four plant community types; Type III, Diospyros morrisiana - Cryptocarya chinensis, locating on the lower slope and stream side was with lower stem density but the highest species heterogeneity; and Type IV, Machilus japonica var. kusanoi - Helicia formosana locating on west stream side was with the lowest stem density and basal area. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) results showed nearly 27.11% of the plant species composition was attributable to micro-topographic variables. Ridge distance, stream distance and convexity were the most important factors effected the changes of plant community and species composition. Classification and regression tree (CART) method was also used to examine the relationship between each single specie and micro-topographic variables. Over 70% species had more than 27.11 % variations which explained by DCA results. To conclude, our results support the existence of habitat association and niche divergence related to micro-topography in a subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest.

N2  - Knowledge of demographical rates at seedling stage is critical for understanding forest composition and dynamics. We monitored the seedling dynamics of tree species in a subtropical rain forest in Fushan, northern Taiwan (24°45' N, 121°35' E) during an 8-yr period (2003-2010). There were great temporal fluctuations in the seedling density, which might be largely driven by the pulses of seedling recruitment. Interspecific variation in the seedling abundance, however, was not related to the reproductive adult abundance. Previous studies showed that frequent typhoon disturbances contributed to the high canopy openness and high understory light availability at Fushan, which might benefit tree regeneration. But our results do not support this idea. Most of the newly recruited seedlings died within six months and only grew 1.55 ± 0.20 cm per year, which might be suppressed by the dense understory vegetation. Our results suggested that the majority of tree species in Fushan were recruitment limited, which might have important consequences for species coexistence. High temporal variability in recruitment density and low growth rates of seedlings emphasize the importance of long-term studies to our understandings of forest dynamics.

N2  - A rare and little known, endemic fern Thelypteris kingii C.F.Reed was first described from a 19^th Century collection from an unspecified locality in what was then ”British Sikkim”, now Darjeeling District, India. Recently a small population of the plant was rediscovered by the author from present-day Sikkim State. Herbarium records and field study reveal that this species is very rare and under great threat of extinction due to natural and man-made impact. This species is therefore little known to pteridologists and is readily confused with the similar, but common species, T. mollissima (Kunze) N.Thapa as well as with another S. E. Asian species T. leptogrammoides (Ross.) C.F. Reed due to nomenclatural similarities or being later homonymous. Although only known so far from India, and thus an endemic Indian species, its presence in Tibet and China etc. is probably to be expected. A brief history of its discovery, taxonomy, morphology, habitat and ecology is presented here to assist taxonomists and conservation biologists with its identification and conservation. It has been identified as Endangered and Globally Threatened and efforts have also been made by the present author to include it in the forthcoming volume of the Red Data Book of Indian plants.

N2  - Fish species are varied in their capacity to biosynthesize n-3 highlyunsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) such as eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA & DHA) that are crucial to the health and well-being of all higher vertebrates. Experts report that HUFA metabolism involves enzyme-mediated fatty acyl desaturation (FAD) and elongation (FAE) processes. In previous studies, different workers cloned, characterized, identified and reported several genes for FAD and FAE enzymes in different fish species such as Atlantic salmon, gilthead seabream, rainbow trout and zebrafish, and also demonstrated the up- and down-regulation in the activity of these enzymes in response to fluctuations in dietary HUFA. In this paper, we report on the expression of genes (mRNA transcripts) for FAD and FAE enzymes in different tissues of Channa striata (Bloch, 1793) fingerling, to evaluate the tissues of the fish in which activity of both enzymes are high. To achieve this objective, we used conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to isolate and quantify the absolute copy number for each gene transcripts from 8 different tissues of the fish (reared with a commercial feed). Our estimate show that the distribution of the 2 enzyme transcripts were significantly (P ＜ 0.05) higher in the liver and brain of C. striata than detected in the 6 other tissues evaluated (muscle, ovary, testis, intestine, kidney and skin). Subsequently, we discuss here extensively, the implication of this observation with respect to the use of vegetable oils (VO) as substitute to fish oil (FO) in diets for freshwater fish species.

Hence, the name C. ceylanica is reduced to a variety of C. trapezia and a new combination C. trapezia var. ceylanica is made here. Figures and photographs are provided to prove the conclusion. Incidentally, var. ceylanica is an addition to the liverwort flora of India from Courtallam in the Southern Western Ghats.

N2  - Research on the pollination of Sirindhornia monophylla (Collett & Hemsl.) H. A. Pedersen & Suksathan was carried out in W Thailand, 2010‒2012. The orchid is a nectariferous, non-autogamous and self-compatible terrestrial. During 120 man-hours of flower watching, three species of Ceratina were found to be the main pollinators, viz. C. (Ceratinidia) lieftincki van der Vecht, C. (C.) collusor Cockerell, C. (Pithitis) smaragdula (Fabricius), males and/or females. Braunsapis hewitti (Cameron) was a minor pollinator. Ceratina acquired pollinia on their forehead and in some cases they subsequently deposited massulae on the stigma of other S. monophylla flowers. Three further species, viz. Ceratina (Ceratinidia) accusator Cockerell, C. (C.) chiangmaiensis W., M. & L. and C. (C.) bryanti Cockerell, did not acquire pollinia; but in these cases all pollen in the visited flowers had already been removed by previous pollinators. Ceratina belongs to family Apidae, subfamily Xylocopinae, tribe Ceratinini, whereas Braunsapis belongs to tribe Allodapini. Fruit set was nearly 50%. This is the first detailed account on the pollination of a Sirindhornia species, a recently described genus with three species, all included in the Thai redlist.

N2  - Genomic DNA was isolated using three DNA extraction commercial kits and three CTAB-based methods for two non-photosynthetic plants, Balanophora japonica and Mitrastemon kanehirai. The quality of the isolated DNA was evaluated and subjected to following restriction enzyme digestions. All six procedures yielded DNA of sufficient quality for PCR, and the method described by Barnwell et al. (1998) performed well in isolating DNA from both species for restriction enzyme digestion. In addition, we succeeded to enrich plastid DNA content by using the methods depending on a high salt buffer to deplete nuclear material. The 'high salt' methods based on protocol presented by Milligan (1989) were able to increase plastid DNA effectively and significantly reduce nuclear DNA from M. kanehirai. The plastid DNA enrichment protocols are inexpensive and not time-consuming, and may be applicable to other non-photosynthetic plants.

N2  - The species composition and structure of the plant communities along and in the fast-flowing streams on different bedrock types of the tropical mainland South-East Asia were investigated. The study was carried out in Peninsular Thailand, on the Nakhon Si Thammarat mountain range. A total number of 14 plots were placed within the five selected streams where vascular plants species had been collected, starting from November 2010 until July 2012. The estimation of the species was calculated by computer program EstimateS, and in order to distinguish plant communities, a cluster analysis was performed. A total number of 109 species of vascular plants has been recorded, with 59 species in the granite and 60 in the calcareous bedrock streams. There were four types of plant communities that had were categorized; of which three types occurred in the granitic bedrock streams and the other could be seen exclusively in the calcareous bedrock. It is convinced that the types of the bedrock as well as the topographic features of the streams might have major impact on the characterization of the plant communities.

N2  - One newly recorded species of Nitella, N. mirabilis Nordstedt ex J. Groves (Charales, Charophyta) was found in Taiwan primarily based on the morphological features. This newly recorded species is characterized by being a monoecious plant, oospore surface appears an anastomosing network and possessing unicellular dactyls. Its monoecious nature and the characteristics of its reproductive organs separate it from other species of the genus. Its vegetative morphology is similar in many respects to that of the monoecious species belong to section Nitella, subgenus Nitella. However, the surface view of the oospores of N. mirabilis appears fibrillar based on the SEM observations due to the occurrence of the anastomosing network of fine fibrils. Such character is unique among the known species of the genus Nitella. N. mirabilis was found in a lake of Fushan Research Station, Yilan County, Taiwan in which the water depth range from a few centimeters to one meter.

N2  - A study was conducted to understand the host-parasite relationship in terms of anatomical and physiological adaptations in ＂Morinda tinctoria＂ Roxb. and ＂Cassytha filiformis＂ L. Anatomically the haustorium of ＂Cassytha＂ is found to have two parts, the upper haustorium and the endophyte. The former is the portion of a haustorium that lies external to the host organ, whereas the endophyte is the portion of a haustorium that penetrates host tissues. It was also observed that the host organ triggers the dedifferentiation of cortical parenchyma to develop dense cytoplasm, conspicuous nuclei and numerous starch grains and these cells are found to serve as the initials of upper haustorium. The level of Chl ＂b＂ was lower than Chl ＂a＂ and xanthophylls in ＂Cassytha＂ when compared to ＂Morinda＂. The photosynthetic activity was measured in intact leaves/stems of both the host and parasitic plant using Chl ＂a＂ fluorescence induction kinetics, which revealed that the photosynthetic efficiency was very low in the infected sample as well as in the parasite stem. Over all, the reduction in the photosynthetic efficiency was correlated to the poorly developed PS II complex.

N2  - Quantitative data on patterns of distribution and diversity of grasslands is necessary for conservation planning and sustainable utilization. This is the first study to document and analyse the phytosociological data of grasslands of entire Rajasthan state, India. The data was collected through stratified random sampling method by laying 515 sample plots. The study found 375 species belonging to 188 genera and 46 families. Species diversity (Shannon-Weiner diversity) in seven grassland community types ranged between 2.59 and 3.18. The highest Shannon-Weiner diversity index (H’ = 3.18) was found in ＂Aristida-Dichanthium＂ grassland followed by ＂Sehima-Apluda＂ grassland (H’ = 3.17). The Simpson diversity index and Similarity index are quite different from each other reveals the uniqueness of these grasslands types. Based on our analysis we are concluding that, saline grasslands and swampy grasslands are narrow-niched and ecologically unique. Analysis showed grasslands of Rajasthan as highly species diverse communities and requires prioritization in the long term conservation planning.

N2  - To gain a better understanding of traits and mechanisms underlying the fast spreading of an invasive plant, ＂B. pilosa var. radiate＂, in Taiwan, we compared vegetative and reproductive growth of this invasive plant with its sympatric congener ＂Bidens bipinnata＂ L., a naturalized species. The two species had similar photosaturated photosynthetic rate and apparent quantum yield. However, both species differed in the temperature response of seed germination, in traits associated with life history, and in biomass allocation pattern. At winter temperature (18°C) seed germination was inhibited in ＂B. bipinnata＂ but not in ＂B. pilosa＂ var. ＂radiate＂. Compared to ＂B. bipinnata＂, ＂B. pilosa＂ var. ＂radiate＂ had higher specific leaf area, allocated more resource to leaves and roots in early growth stage, consequently, had a better growth and accumulated more biomass for an extended growth period. Laboratory experiment showed that shoot segments of ＂B. pilosa＂ var. ＂radiata＂ were capable of growing adventitious roots while those of ＂B. bipinnata＂ had no such ability. Thus, differences in specific leaf area, pattern of biomass allocation, seed germination response and vegetative reproduction between these two species explained why ＂B. pilosa var. radiata＂ outcompeted ＂B. bipinnata＂ in the field.

N2  - The mating system of the Taiwan field vole (＂Microtus kikuchii＂) has been proposed to be monogamous. In monogamous animals, individuals should exhibit monogamy syndromes, such as little sexual dimorphism and strong pair bonding (a strong social preference for a familiar partner versus a strange one). In this study, we examined the effect of cohabitation on the partner preference. In a reciprocal experiment, all test individuals were cohabited with a heterosexual vole for 24 hr prior to the partner preference trials. We collected the feces of voles before and after the trials, and analyzed the concentration of fecal steroid hormones, including testosterone of males, progesterone and estradiol of females, and corticosterone of all voles. The results showed that the behaviors of focal voles were not influenced by the status (partner or stranger) of stimulus vole. There was no significant relationship between steroid hormones and partner preference. Furthermore, the degree of sexual dimorphism in the Taiwan field vole was low, and similar to that of the monogamous prairie vole (＂M. ochrogaster＂). In light of this study and other recent findings, we propose that the mating system of the Taiwan field vole is not strictly monogamy, but flexible depending on environmental conditions.

N2  - Phytogeographical study of gymnosperms in Taiwan is carried out based on reviewing data gathered from published papers on fossils, phylogeny and phylogeography. Following questions are asked. (1) How is the high degree of endemism of gymnosperm flora of Taiwan derived? (2) How many source areas of gymnosperms in Taiwan are there? (3) Is there relation between distribution pattern of endemic gymnosperms in Taiwan and those of their sister species? (4) How do gymnosperms migrate to Taiwan? In total, 28 taxa including 19 species and 9 varieties of gymnosperms are in Taiwan. Compared to the Flora of Taiwan 2nd edition, ＂Nageia fleuryi＂ is excluded and ＂Pinus taiwanensis＂ var. ＂fragilissima＂ is added in this paper. Species status of ＂Calocedrus formosana＂ and ＂Tsuga formosana＂ and variety status of ＂Cunninghamia lanceolata＂ var. ＂konishii＂ are retained. Scientific names are adopted for ＂Juniperus morrisonicola＂ instead of ＂J. squamata＂ and for ＂Juniperus tsukusiensis＂ var. ＂taiwanensis＂ instead of ＂J. chinensis＂ var. ＂taiwanensis＂. According to distribution patterns, these 28 taxa may be categorized into tropical origin (TO), Southern Hemisphere origin (SMO) and Northern Hemisphere origin (NMO). Gymnosperms in Taiwan with high degree of endemism, 78.5%, may owe to woody habit, which is wider in ecological niche compared to herbaceous one and would be less sensitive to the environmental changes, and owe to temperate essence that is more easily to find shelters during temperature fluctuations. Taxa of TO and SMO are inclined to inhabit low altitudes and sporadically distributed, whereas taxa of NMO are inclined to inhabit middle to high altitudes, especially in northern and central Central Mountain Range and may be widely or restrictedly distributed. Distribution patterns of endemic taxa of NMO in Taiwan are related with those of their sister species. Taxa with sister species in higher latitudes such as Japan, northwestern China and central China are distributed in higher altitudes with midpoint of altitudinal distribution over 1800 m, while those with sister species in lower latitudes such as South China, southern South China, southeastern China are distributed in lower altitudes with midpoint of altitudinal distribution under 2000 m. Most fossil histories of endemic taxa of NMO may trace back to Asia or North America (NAM) except ＂Juniperus morrisonicola＂ that may trace back to Europe. For those traced back to NAM, ancestors in NAM migrated to northeastern Asia via Biringia, from where dispersed southward either to Japan, or to northern China and then to central and eastern China. From Japan, ancestors either migrated southward through the Ryukyus to Taiwan if sister species were restricted to Japan, or they might have dispersed to continental Asia and evolved when Japan was a part of continental Asia and further migrated southward via East China Sea’s land bridge to Taiwan. From central or eastern China, ancestors migrated southward either via East China Sea’s land bridge or through southeastern China via Tungshan land bridge to Taiwan. Ancestors in Europe migrated southward to the Himalayas, from where through the Yun-Kue Plateau, Nanling via Tungshan land bridge to Taiwan. Southwestern China (SWC) plus IndoChina is both refuge and dispersal center. Taxa of SMO might have dispersed from the South Hemisphere through southeastern Asia to IndoChina, from where migrated either through southern South China via South China Sea’s land bridge to southern Taiwan, or through South China via Tungshan land bridge to central Taiwan. If taxa of NMO share short genetic distance with their sister species in SWC, their migration routes would be like those of SMO. However, if taxa of NMO share longer genetic distance with their sister species in SWC, one lineage of their ancestors, possibly distributed in central China then, migrated through southeastern China via Tungshan land bridge to Taiwan while another lineage in central China further dispersed to SWC and produced disjunct distribution patterns. Taxa of gymnosperms in Taiwan distributed in higher altitudes are inclined to have sister species distributed in higher latitudes. However, horizontal distribution patterns of gymnosperms in Taiwan may be blurred by long history of colonization. Thus horizontal distribution patterns can only be explained by obtaining more data on fossils and paleogeography of such taxa in Taiwan.

N2  - ＂Remusatia vivipara＂ and ＂Remusatia pumila＂ can produce both sexual flowers and asexual bulbils. However, ＂R. vivipara＂ seldom set seeds, whereas ＂R. pumila＂ have regular seed set. Our aim was to understand the asexual mode of bulbil development and the reasons for sexual failure in ＂R. vivipara＂. Asexual bulbil development was observed by scanning electron and light microscopy. Pollen viability and germination rate were counted for at least 200 pollen grains in triplicate for each inflorescence. Chromosome counting was performed to confirm ＂R. vivipara＂ as triploid species. The bulbiliferous shoots of both ＂R. vivipara＂ and ＂R. pumila＂ initiate from the upper portions of tubers. As they elongate upward, bulbil clusters generates in each node of the shoot. Bulbils develop several hooked scales on top simultaneously, which facilitate dispersal because they can easily attach to the animal's fur. Although ＂R. vivipara＂ produces showy flowers in spring, their pollen grains were inviable and unable to germinate in vitro in sucrose solution, when compared with ＂R. pumila＂. These two bulbiliferous species have diversified their reproductive strategies, with respect to ＂R. vivipara＂ being able to reproduce completely asexually and ＂R. pumila＂ being able to reproduce both sexually and asexually.

N2  - Investigations in the tracheary elements of rhizomes, roots and stipes of four cheilanthoid ferns from two genera ＂viz. Aleuritopteris albomarginata＂, ＂A. bicolor＂, ＂A. rufa＂ and ＂Cheilanthes tenuifolia＂ have been made both through maceration followed by light microscopic study and longitudinal sections through SEM study. Presence of vessel elements has been detected in the rhizomes of these species and roots of all species except ＂A. albomarginata＂. No vessel elements were found in the stipes of any member. The vessel elements were having distinct obliquely elongated endplates mostly provided with compound perforation plate without any pit membrane. Detection of vessel elements in these plants which usually grow in dry habitats justifies their ecological success in rapid uptake of water with limited period of water availability.

N2  - Ecological Impact Assessment (EIA) is instrumental in guarding biodiversity from ill-planned development projects. Much of EIA involves field surveys of different taxonomic groups and their habitats, but little information is available on what factors influence the performance of these surveys. In this study, we used a recently developed evaluation checklist to understand the state of biodiversity surveys. We asked two questions: 1) Have the installment of laws and guidelines improved survey performance? 2) Does surveyor background affect the performance of surveys? The EIA reports in Taiwan were our study subjects. The results show that the majority of ecological impact assessments are performed poorly, although the average quality of reports has increased significantly over time, with legislation playing a key role in improving the quality of surveys. We also found that the background of surveyors had significant effects on survey reports. The effects need to be interpreted with care. We propose that training and certification be required for personnel performing surveys.

N2  - ＂Abies kawakamii＂ forests are generally distributed above 3,000 m in Taiwanese high mountains. The community data used in our analysis were derived from the database of the National Vegetation Diversity Inventory and Mapping Project of Taiwan (NVDIMP), and environmental data were obtained from the WorldClim and NVDIMP databases. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to identify vegetation composition of ＂Abies＂ communities and the structural equation models (SEMs) were used to examine the complex relationships between environmental factors and vegetation composition. The results of ordination showed the most important factors determining species composition of ＂Abies＂ forests involved habitat rockiness, heat load index, warmth index and summer and winter. SEM results approved the warmth index and winter precipitation were the main drivers determining the latent variable-climate, which significantly affect the overstory composition of ＂Abies＂ communities. The relative frequency of ＂Yushania niitakayamensis＂ also had a minor effect on the overstory. However, the relative frequency of ＂Yushania＂ had strong and significant effects on the understory flora and it was also strongly correlated with rock ratio and winter precipitation. Moreover, the overstory displayed a negative but insignificant coefficient on the understory composition, and this might be attributed to the fragile and high heterogeneous habitat in Taiwanese high mountain areas.

N2  - Stathmin family genes are known to mediate microtubule disassembly that makes them potential regulators for integrating diverse intracellular signaling pathways. To investigate the roles of stathmins in zebrafish (＂Danio rerio＂) development, we cloned and characterized four zebrafish stathmin genes, including ＂stathmin 1b＂ (＂stmn1b＂), ＂stathmin-like 2a＂ (＂stmn2a＂), ＂stathmin-like 3＂ (＂stmn3＂), and ＂stathmin-like 4＂ (＂stmn4＂). All four stathmins contains a conserved stathmin-like domain with consensus phosphorylation domains and share high homology with their vertebral counterparts. RT-PCR and whole-mount ＂in situ＂ hybridization analyses revealed that zebrafish ＂stathmins＂ are mainly expressed in the central nervous system with divergent temporal and spatial expressions. This suggests roles of stathmins in neuronal regulation during development in zebrafish. By knocking down ＂stmn2a＂ we observed smaller brain, enlarge brain ventricle, brain edema and narrowed midbrain and hindbrain boundary. We also confirmed the observed phenotypes by using whole-mount ISH against ＂islet1＂ and found that ＂islet1＂ expression was reduced in ＂stmn2a＂ MO-injected embryos. In addition, these brain defects were specifically due to the loss of ＂stmn2a＂ because they could not be induced by a mis-match ＂stmn2a＂ MO and could be rescued by co-injecting ＂stmn2a＂ mRNA. Collectively, these results suggest a pivotal role of ＂stmn2a＂ in zebrafish brain development.

N2  - The present study deals with the estimation of tree density, basal area, biomass and carbon status with the help of nondestructive allometric equations method in tropical deciduous forest in 0.1 ha permanent plots, established in twenty sites in four districts of state of Madhya Pradesh in central India. The volume of tree was calculated using site specific local or regional volume equation. The biomass of each species was estimated taking tree volume and species specific gravity. The relationship between basal area and above ground biomass showed positive correlation for all sites and forest types. Field measurements for density ranged from 147 trees ha^(-1) to 777.5 trees ha^(-1) while basal area were 0.6 m^2．ha^(-1) to 10.72 m^2．ha^(-1). The biomass ranged from 3.99 t．ha^(-1) to 53.90 t．ha^(-1) and carbon stock from 1.89 t．ha^(-1) to 25.6 t．ha^(-1) across the all different study sites. This study concludes that tropical deciduous forests of the studied area in Madhya Pradesh are having strong potential for carbon sequestration. Estimation of above ground tree biomass in the present study provides data for tropical deciduous forests covering a large part (24.66%) of state for further use.

N2  - ＂Begonia natunaensis＂, a new species of sect. ＂Reichenheimia＂ from Natuna Island, Indonesia, is here described and illustrated. ＂Begonia natunaensis＂ resembles ＂B. goegoensis＂ N.E. Brown in having suborbicular, peltate leaves with an abruptly tapering tip, differing in the number of tepals in staminate flowers (2vs.4) and in pistillate flower (2vs.3) and the petiole (terete vs. 4-angular). The new species is also similar to another peltate-leaved ＂Begonia＂, ＂B. sudjanae＂ Jans., but is distinguishable by being glabrous (vs. hispid throughout), the staminate tepals 2 [vs. (2-)4], and pistillate tepals 2 [vs. (2-)3]. Geographically, ＂B. natunaensis＂ is endemic to Natuna Island in the South China Sea, whereas ＂B. goegoensis＂ and ＂B. sudjanae＂ are distributed in western Sumatra, ＂ca＂. 1,000 km away from Natuna.

N2  - The paper embodies description of a new species of the dispersed seed taxon ＂Rugaspermum＂ (Pant and Basu, 1977), ＂R. stipitatus＂, from the Triassic beds of Nidpur, M.P., India. The new species is distinct from earlier described ones (＂R. insigne, R. media, R. obscura and R. minuta＂) in exhibiting a prominently demarcated wide stalk like rim at the chalazal end. The micropyle is short, tubular and not markedly protuberant. Seeds are about 3 mm long×2 mm wide, orthotropous, platyspermic, oblong to oval with broadly tapered ends. Seed surface is rough often appearing wrinkled. On maceration the seeds yield four membranes viz., outer, inner, nucellar and megaspore membranes. Outer cuticle is papillate and stomatiferous. Inner cuticle is thin and delicate. Nucellar membrane is free above forming a large dome shaped pollen chamber but fused to megaspore membrane at base. Pollen chamber containing striate, unwinged, ＂Rugapites＂ Pant and Basu type pollen grains that are remotely comparable to the polyplicate pollen types of gnetophytes. Megaspore membrane is thick, dark and wide. Pollination is possibly entemophilous.

N2  - We found ＂Gastrodia fontinalis＂ T. P. Lin in a bamboo forest from Takeshima Island, which is the northernmost island of the Ryukyu Islands in Japan. This species is apparently rare and was previously considered to be an endemic Taiwanese species. Because there are a few minor differences between the original description and our specimens collected in Takeshima Island, here we report Gastrodia fontinalis from Takeshima Island as the first record outside of Taiwan, with a description of the specimens from Takeshima Island.

N2  - Remusatia vivipara is an epiphyte of possibly ornamentally and medically important plant, but flowering is rare in fields. The present experiments were conducted to study the influences of different concentrations of gibberellic acid (GA3) and tuber sizes on the flower initiation, inflorescence characteristics and vegetative growth in R. vivipara. GA3 concentration as low as 25 mg L^(-1) could induce flowering. The results of a binary logistic regression analysis indicated that the flowering was significantly associated both with GA3 concentration and tuber size. However, comparing with the non-GA3 treated tubers, different GA3 concentrations did not significantly affect flowering. The result also showed no significant effect induced by GA3 treatments on the number of days to flower. In contrast, the Wald statistic revealed that both tuber size (2.51-3.00 cm) and tuber size (3.01-3.50 cm) made more significant contributions to the prediction of flowering. Tuber diameters above 3.01 cm with 100 mg L^(-1) GA3 treatment could bring all plants to flower. Results of canonical discriminant analysis and ANOVA tests indicated that there were no differences for all inflorescence characters (inflorescence length, male zone length, sterile zone length and female zone length) among different concentrations of GA3 tested. On the contrary, significant differences among the tuber diameter classes for all inflorescence characteristics measured were markedly evident. Generally, sizes of almost all inflorescence characteristics increased with increasing tuber sizes. When considering vegetative characters, significant differences in the fresh and dry weights of bulbil stolon were found between treated and untreated tubers. Although there was a trend of increase in weights with increasing GA3 concentrations, but this was not statistically significant. Our results for R. vivipara showed the induction of flowering by GA3 only influence of flower initiation, but no effects on inflorescence and vegetation characteristics. The present study also revealed that large tuber size made more significant contributions to the prediction of flowering, and the magnitude of inflorescence characteristics.

N2  - Floristic composition and diversity patterns of vascular plants along an altitudinal transect (3300-3900m a.s.l.) in relation to anthropogenic disturbance, edaphic variables and slope were studied in an alpine rangeland of Gurez valley, Kashmir. A total of 111 plant species belonging to 36 families and 86 genera were recorded over 245 quadrats that were placed at seven sites. Evaluated on species richness, diversity (alpha and beta) and composition was negatively correlated to altitude, though the relationship was not monotonic. Matching the changes in floristic composition and richness to various environmental variables through canonical correspondence analysis further strengthened the importance of altitude in influencing species composition. Species tolerant of trampling and other disturbances were dominant at largely disturbed lower altitudes (＜3500m) while at higher altitudes (＞3700m) their dominance decreased considerably, suggesting that anthropogenic disturbance is also important in influencing species composition. Our results showed that species turnover rates were high at higher (＞3500m) altitudes. The study provides an insight on the plant composition of this region and accentuates the need for its proper conservation.

N2  - The genus ＂Elatostema＂ (Urticaceae) in Taiwan is taxonomically revised based on morphological characters, molecular phylogeny and geographic distribution. ＂Elatostema acuteserratum＂ is not only found in Lanyu, but also in southern and eastern of Taiwan. ＂Elatostema herbaceifolium＂ is treated as a synonym of ＂E. cyrtandrifolium＂ and we also confirm the existence of its male inflorescence in Taiwan. ＂Elatostema yonakuniense＂ in Japan is treated as a synonym of ＂E. microcephalanthum＂ that is not an endemic species in Taiwan and Japan. ＂Elatostema multicanaliculatum＂ is treated as a synonym of ＂E. oblongifolium＂ and ＂E. platyphylloides＂ as a synonym of ＂E. platyphyllum＂ and these two taxa are no longer endemic species in Taiwan. In summary, there are a total of sixteen species in Taiwan, including one hybrid species.

N2  - ＂Begonia grandis＂ Dry. (Begoniaceae), previously recognized as endemic to continental China, was recently discovered from southern Taiwan. Close morphological observations and molecular phylogenetic analysis elucidated that the species in Taiwan belongs to subspecies ＂grandis＂. ＂Begonia grandis＂ has a long history in cultivation especially in China and Japan but not in Taiwan. The collection locality in Taiwan had no trace of human activity. Therefore, ＂B. grandis＂ is considered to be native to Taiwan. The new finding in Taiwan marks the southernmost distribution record of the species. Unfortunately, the discovered population was destroyed by a landslide due to a typhoon in 2009. Further field survey in neighboring areas is needed to elucidate the current status of ＂B. grandis＂ in Taiwan.

N2  - In the present study soil, water and plant samples were collected from seven different natural populations of Isoetes dixitei which are found growing on the tablelands of Satara and Kolhapur districts of Maharashtra, India. The collected soil and water samples have been analysed for the colour, texture, available plant nutrients, electrical conductivity, pH and BOD. The soil and water factors along with biotic factors are compared with the number of plants per m^2, length of plants, number of leaves and roots per plant to understand the morphological diversity and biology within different populations of I. dixitei. The results of present analysis reveals that these ecological factors such as organic carbon, iron, phosphorus and potassium in soil and low pH of soil and water have positive relationships with the growth, robustness and diversity of I. dixitei. However, copper, zinc and electrical conductivity in the soil have negative significant role in influencing the plant characters. The role of manganese appears to be not significant. The biological factors play major role in controlling the diversity (number of plants per m^2) of this taxon.

N2  - To fulfil scarce and incomplete information on floral micromorphology of ensets (＂Ensete＂ Bruce ex Horan.) in the banana family (Musaceae), a comparative anatomical study of two species: ＂E. glaucum＂ (Roxb.) Cheesman and E. ＂superbum＂ (Roxb.) Cheesman, native to Thailand was conducted. It was found that, apart from five fertile stamens presented in other members of the Musaceae family, both ensets possess a short staminode. It is suggested from this investigation that six is the basic number of ＂Ensete＂ androecial whorl and the taxa could secure the most primitive status within the family and the Zingiberales order, of which stamen numbers are reduced. The results also indicated that the vascular bundle position in compound tepal, the vascular patterns in vascular zone of ovary and cell shapes of stigma epidermis and the ovary cortex are of systematic significance in conjunction with pollen size and exine ornamentation. These useful micromorphological characters can be further applied for identification of other ＂Ensete＂ species distribute elsewhere in the world.

N2  - Another new variety of ＂Musa itinerans＂ Cheesman in Taiwan is described. The morphological characteristics of the variety are otherwise similar to those of var. formosana (Warb. ex Schum.) Häkkinen & C.-L.Yeh. The principal distinction is based on the length and bending of inflorescence, and the compactness of fruit hands. The inflorescence rachis of the new variety is longer than the other two varieties, and first upwardly slanting, then curving downwards, finally pendent in the male flower regions. The fruit hands grow very compactly and apex of fruit remains distinguished floral relicts. These characteristics are stable at their habitat and Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute (TARI) repository over study periods. This population is herein segregated as the new variety, ＂M. itinerans＂ var. chiumei H.-L. Chiu, C.-T. Shii & T.-Y.A. Yang.

N2  - Radiating plates of xylem are a lianas cambium variation, of which, 22 families have this feature. This study investigates 15 liana species representing nine families with radiating plates of xylem structures. The features of the transverse section and epidermis in fresh liana samples are documented, including shapes and colors of xylem and phloem, ray width and numbers, and skin morphology. Experimental results indicated that the shape of phloem fibers in ＂Ampelopsis brevipedunculata＂ var. ＂hancei＂ is gradually tapered and flame-like, which is in contrast with the other characteristics of this type, including those classified as rays. Both inner and outer cylinders of vascular bundles are found in ＂Piper kwashoense＂, and the irregularly inner cylinder persists yet gradually diminishes. Red crystals are numerous in the cortex of ＂Celastrus kusanoi.＂ ＂Aristolochia shimadai＂ and ＂A. zollingeriana＂ develop a combination of two cambium variants, radiating plates of xylem and a lobed xylem. The shape of phloem in ＂Stauntonia obovatifoliola＂ is square or truncate, and its rays are numerous. Meanwhile, that of ＂Neoalsomitra integrifolia＂ is blunt and its rays are fewer. As for the features of a stem surface within the same family, ＂Cyclea ochiaiana＂ is brownish in color and has a deep vertical depression with lenticels, ＂Pericampylus glaucus＂ is greenish in color with a vertical shallow depression. Within the same genus, ＂Aristolochia shimadai＂ develops lenticels, which are not in ＂A. zollingeriana＂; although the periderm developed in ＂Clematis grata＂ is a ring bark and tears easily, that of ＂Clematis tamura＂ is thick and soft.

N2  - In India, ＂Rhizophora＂ hybrids have been recorded in Pichavaram (Tamil Nadu) and in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI). ＂Rhizophora＂ hybrids in Pichavaram mangrove forest were identified as ＂Rhizophora＂ × ＂annamalayana＂, a cross between ＂R. apiculata＂ and ＂R. mucronata＂, whereas ＂Rhizophora＂ hybrids in the ANI were identified as ＂Rhizophora＂ × ＂lamarckii＂, a cross between ＂R. apiculata＂ and ＂R. stylosa＂. However taxonomical distinction between them was not much explored. A recent floristic survey revealed the occurrence both ＂R. × annamalayana＂ and ＂R. × lamarckii＂ in the ANI, India. Based on critical analysis of specimens and morphometric analysis, it was found that both ＂R. × lamarckii＂ and ＂R. × annamalayana＂ can be distinguished from ＂R. apiculata＂ by their smooth green bract and bracteoles and 2-4 flowered inflorescences within the leaf axils. ＂Rhizophora＂ × ＂annamalayana＂ is distinguished from ＂R. × lamarckii by its broader leaves (length: width ratio ＜ 1.8 vs ＞ 1.8), and shorter style (＜1.5 mm vs. ＞ 1.5 mm) and stamens in two whorls vs. usually in a single whorl. ＂Rhizophora＂ × ＂annamalayana＂ is the new record from the ANI. Higher relative density of ＂R. × annamalayana＂ than ＂R. × lamarckii＂ in the ANI is attributed to the abundance of its parental species (＂R. apiculata＂ and ＂R. mucronata＂) in the ANI.

N2  - ＂Bidens pilosa＂ L. var. ＂radiate＂, an invasive plant in Taiwan, is distributed into mountain area. In contrast to ＂B. pilosa＂ var. ＂radiata＂, ＂B. pilosa＂ var. ＂minor＂ is a naturalized plant and distributed mainly in mid-altitude of the island. This study aims to (1) investigate phenotypic variations between low- and mid-altitudinal populations of these two varieties of ＂B. pilosa＂, and (2) evaluate the causes, environmental effect or genetic differentiation, of the variations. Two populations, one from low-(500 m) and the other from mid- altitude (1300 or1600 m) along an elevation gradient in central Taiwan, of both varieties were selected for the study. We compared ecophysiological traits of field populations and of progeny of these populations cultivated in a common garden. For both varieties, mid-altitudinal populations had significantly higher chlorophyll and N contents, more positive δ^13C values and larger seeds than low-altitudinal populations. However, most of the phenotypic variations between altitudinal populations disappeared in common garden-grown plants. The results suggested that these variations were phenotypic plasticity in response to changes in environmental factors associated with altitudes. Comparing between populations of the same variety, seeds of the var. ＂minor＂ collected from mid-altitudinal population germinated faster. In contrast, seeds of the var. ＂radiata＂ from mid-altitudinal populations germinated slower and required more days to germinate. Thus, seeds produced by the mid-altitudinal population of the var. ＂radiata＂ had inferior germination performance, which might reduce its competitive ability at mid-altitude. However, high degree of phenotypic plasticity would allow ＂B. pilosa＂ var. ＂radiata＂ to spread into mountain area.
