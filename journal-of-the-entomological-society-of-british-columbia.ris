N2  - This paper provides an annotated systematic list of the endemic and potentially rare and endangered freshwater and terrestrial invertebrates in British Columbia. A total of 168 endemic species are listed, and 447 of the species that occur only in British Columbia in Canada are in-cluded. In addition, 203 of the more widely distributed spec ies are listed as potentially rare and endangered in the province, mostly on the basis of limited occurrence or restriction to obviously endangered habitats or ecosystems. The list is based on published information, and information provided by systematic experts. Museum collections were not examined, so additions and correction to the list are expected. Additional study and research is suggested.

N2  - This list documents 2832 Lepidoptera species reported for the province of British Columbia, Canada. It is based on examination of the major public insect collections in the province and the Canadian National Collection of Insects, Arachnids and Nematodes, Ottawa, Ontario. Records from relevant literature sources and online databases have also been examined and reliable ones have been included. The entry for each species includes the scientific name, the author and year of publication of the original description, and occurrence status. Taxonomic, distributional and biological notes are provided for selected species, and 134 species are flagged as introduced from outside North America. An additional 27 species which probably occur in British Columbia are included in the list. A list of 322 species erroneously reported from British Columbia in previous works is provided. Introductory sections provide an overview of the order Lepidoptera, review the province’s ecozones, and discuss the history of lepidopterology in British Columbia and its current state of knowledge. Each of the 70 families occurring in the province is briefly reviewed, along with information on its distinguishing features, general appearance and biology and diversity. An index of higher taxonomic names, genera, species, and common names is included.

N2  - Xenotemna pallorana Robinson (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is an alfalfa ( Medicago sativa L., Fabaceae) feeding leafroller that has been considered for incorporation into apple ( Malus domestica Borkh., Rosaceae) orchard ecosystems in Washington State, U.S.A., as an alternative host for the leafroller parasitoid Colpoclypeus florus Walker (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae). Xenotemna pallorana has been observed to feed on apple foliage when populations deplete the foliage of alfalfa in a groundcover, but there have been no studies to determine if foliage of fruit trees is suitable for full larval development or would be attractive as oviposition sites. Leafroller larvae were fed apple, cherry ( Prunus avium L., Rosaceae), pear ( Pyrus communis L., Rosaceae), and alfalfa foliage, all of which proved suitable for development; although development time and pupal weights varied among foliage types. Adult female X. pallorana exposed to apple foliage under no-choice conditions oviposited on the upper side of apple leaves. In a choice test between apple foliage and ground cover including alfalfa, X. pallorana females preferentially selected alfalfa and other components of the ground cover (98.04%) over the apple foliage (1.94%) for oviposition. Despite the ability of X. pallorana to develop on fruit tree foliage, its distinct preference for ovipositing on alfalfa suggests that it is unlikely to damage fruit. Therefore, X. pallorana presents a low-risk opportunity to study enhancement of biological control of leafrollers in orchards through ground cover management and host augmentation.

N2  - Sticky yellow rectangle traps are used to monitor various pest Rhagoletis flies (Diptera: Tephritidae), but it is unclear if relative efficacies of these traps differ with fly species. Here, the main objective was to identify the most efficacious of five commercial sticky yellow rectangles baited with ammonium carbonate against western cherry fruit fly, R. indifferens Curran, apple maggot fly, R. pomonella (Walsh), and walnut husk fly, R. completa Cresson, in Washington State, U.S.A. Two plastic yellow sticky strips (PL1 and PL2) supplemented with Tanglefoot adhesive and three sticky yellow cardboards, the Pherocon AM (PA1), Multigard AM (PA2) and Alpha Scents Yellow Card (PA3), were tested. Across all three species, the PL1 and PL2 + Tanglefoot generally caught the most flies, the PA3 sometimes caught more than the PA1, and all caught more than the PA2. Adding Tanglefoot to the PA1 did not make the trap as efficacious as the PL1 + Tanglefoot against R. indifferens , but it did against R. pomonella and R. completa . Results suggest the plastic rectangles tested here are better than standard cardboard rectangles for capturing high numbers of all three Rhagoletis species, implying they should be the rectangles of choice for monitoring these flies. Results also suggest that similar trap efficacies against the three species may have different underlying causes.

N2  - Although understanding the requirements of species is an essential component of their conservation, the extent of dietary specialisation is unknown for most pollinators in Canada. In this paper, we investigate pollen preference of two bees, Andrena angustitarsata Vierick and A. auricoma Smith [Hymenoptera: Andrenidae]. Both species range widely throughout Western North America and associated floral records are diverse. However, these species were primarily associated with spring-blooming Apiaceae in the oak-savannah ecosystem of Vancouver Island, BC, specifically Lomatium utriculatum [Nutt. ex Torr. & A. Gray] J.M. Coult. & Rose, L. nudicaule [Pursh] J.M. Coult. & Rose, and Sanicula crassicaulis Poepp ex. DC. Floral visit records and scopal pollen composition for these species from two regions on Vancouver Island indicate dietary specialisation in oak-savannah habitats where Apiaceae are present. Both species were also caught in low abundances in residential gardens where Apiaceae were scarce, sometimes on unrelated plants with inflorescence morphology similar (to our eyes) to Apiaceae. Further study of these species is needed to understand whether preferences observed locally in BC exist elsewhere in their range. Our findings contribute to understanding pollen preference in natural and urban areas, and highlight an important factor to consider for species-specific conservation action in a highly sensitive fragmented ecosystem.

N2  - Verbenone (4,6,6-trimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-3-en-2-one) is an antiaggregant of the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), the most notable forest insect pest in western North America. Several formulations are registered for tree protection, but efficacy is often inconsistent. We evaluated the efficacy of a newly registered formulation of (–)-verbenone (SPLAT ® Verb, ISCA Technologies Inc., Riverside, CA, USA) for protecting individual lodgepole pines, Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud, ponderosa pines, P . ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws., and sugar pines, P . lambertiana Dougl., from mortality attributed to D . ponderosae . Rather than a single release device, SPLAT ® Verb is a flowable emulsion that allows the user to adjust the size of each release point (dollop) according to desired rates and distributions. SPLAT ® Verb applied at 7.0 g of (−)-verbenone/tree as four equally sized dollops to the tree bole was effective for protecting P . contorta , but not P . ponderosa . In P . lambertiana , 4.0, 7.0, and 10.0 g of (−)-verbenone/tree were effective. We discuss the implications of these and other results to the management of D . ponderosae.

N2  - The systemic insecticides disulfoton. oxydemeton-methyl and demeton, were highly effective in controlling the lettuce aphid, Nasonovia ribisnigri (Mosley) (Homoptera: Aphididae), when sprayed on crisphead lettuce at the early stage of heading. Total residues of disulfoton, applied at 1.12 kg AI/ha and oxydemelOn-methyl at 0.56 kg AI/ha. diminished to less than 0.06 ppm 28 days after application, making these compounds strong candidates to replace the discontinued demeton. The local systemic compounds pirimicarb and methamidophos were intermediate in effectiveness between the systemics listed and contact insecticides such as endosulfan, mevinphos and parathion when applied to lettuce before the heading stage. Seven methods of applying methamidophos at 1. 1 kg AI/ha all provided equally significant levels of lettuce aphid control.

N2  - The lettuce aphid. Nasonovia ribisnigri (Mosley), is the most serious pest of crisphead lettuce in the lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia. To develop an efficient monitoring program. several fields of commercially grown head lettuce (cv. Ithaca) were inspected to determine the spatial distribution of the aphids. Infested plants were scattered in the fields but most often were near the margins. Therefore. to monitor for infestations, sampling should be confined to plants around the perimeters of commercial lettuce field s. Distribution within the heads was studied by infesting young plants and inspecting the leaves individually at harvest. Significantly more lettuce aphids were found on the wrapper leaves and just inside the lettuce heads than on the outer or the innermost leaves.

N2  - Defoliation caused by the western spruce budworm , Choristneura occidentalis Freeman, was estimated on 91 Douglas-fir trees Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco, by both close examination of cut -branches and by observation with binoculars. For individual trees the accuracy attained with the binoculars was within 23% for current year&#039;s and 19% for foliage of all ages , with respect to the estimates made from cut branches. Inaccuracy was found to be mainly due to lack of precision as bias was minimal. When the trees were assigned. by each method , into the broad de foliation classes of light ( 1-25%). moderate (26-65%), and severe (66- 100%). as used in forest insect surveys in British Columbia. the results agreed in 89% of the trees studied for defoliation estimates of current foliage and 68% of the trees for defoliation of total foliage. Classification of the location averages into severity classes agreed for all 5 locations studied for damage to current and total foliage. We concluded that the binocular method is a quick and useful means of classifying stands into broad defoliation severity classes. but is not suitable if a high degree of accuracy and precision is needed.

Franco, infested by western spruce bud worm (WSB), Choristoneura occidentalis (Freeman), and the resulting stand defoliation. This relationship can be used to assess the bud worm population in the early spring , either as a pre-treatment check or to predict damage.

Emergent beetles were collected daily and stored at 5°C. Mortality was assessed daily for 21 days , after which the insects were killed. All dead beetles were examined under UV light for the presence and degree of marking. The survival of marked beetles was compared to that of unmarked beetles from control bolts. Analysis of variance showed no difference in mortality rate due to the treatment.

N2  - Pine oil (Norpine-65) was evaluated as an infestation deterrent for the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, in a high hazard forest of lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelmann. Two experimental treatments were tested, each in four, 9 ha, square blocks (replicates): 1) spraying trees in a grid at 50m centres with 1.8 L of pine oil/tree, and 2) creating a " barrier" consisting of a double line of pine oil sprayed trees, 25 m apart, 25 m with in the block boundary. There were significantly reduced ratios of newly-infested (green) trees to the previous year&#039;s infested (red) trees in both treatments compared to control blocks. However. neither treatment prevented beetles from attacking semiochemical-baited trees 75 m in side the block boundaries, and neither treatment is recommended for operational use. At maximum costs/ha of $22.04 and $43.39 (Can.) for grid and barrier treatments. respectively, the operational use of a repellent. or an insecticide would approach cost effectiveness if it reduced new infestations of D. ponderosae by 1 or 2 trees/ha. respectively.

Trypodendron lineatum (Olivier), to Lindgren multiple-funnel traps in a forest setting. A laboratory study examined the flight responses of T. lineatum to various release rates of ethanol and lineatin, alone and in combination. in a wind tunnel. Lineatin was the only effective chemical in attracting the beetles to the traps in both studies. There were no synergistic effects from adding ethanol or a-pinene, alone or together, to lineatin-baited traps in the field. The responses of both sexes in the wind tunnel were highest at lineatin release rates of 8 and 64 ug/24 h. A decrease in response occurred at 512 ug/24 h.

N2  - Fenpropathrin (56 g [AI]/ha) and dimethoate ( 1681 g [AI]/ha) controlled the western grape leafhopper, Erythroneura elegantula Osborn. Arthropod predators were collected on wine grapes, Vitis Vinifera (L.). Most were of uncertain importance in the regulation of Erythroneura spp. populations. The greatest source of leathopper egg mortality is parasitization by the mymarid wasp, Anagrus epos Girault. Vineyards grown in isolated areas ( 10-20 Km from other irrigated areas) are subject to leafhopper injury in the absence of the parasitoid which requires a continuous supply of leafhopper eggs. The concept of infesting French prune, Prunus domestica L. , with non-pestiferous Erythroneura prunicola as a winter refugium for A. epos is advanced as an approach to biological control of Erythroneura spp. in isolated areas.

N2  - By using laboratory flight mills, I tested the hypothesis that the differential distributions of knapweed gall flies, Urophora quadrifasciata and U. affinis , among knapweed sites can be predicted by the flight propensity and endurance of the flies. Results from tests did not support the prediction that the former species displays the greater propensity for flight and endurance. I discuss several reasons supporting the values obtained and their validity for use in interspecific comparisons. Finally, I point to the danger of extrapolating laboratory behaviour to the field.

N2  - Larval growth of variegated cutwormS from a laboratory colony (maintained for over 12 generations) was compared with that of the F1 generation of field-collected larvae on an artificial medium. After eleven days of feeding , larvae from the wild population weighed, on average, over three times as much as those from the laboratory colony. However, when larvae from each population were reared on media spiked with an inhibitory plant extract, the degree of growth inhibition relative to their respective controls was equivalent.

A. cucumeris completed development in 11.09, 8.74 and 6.25 days at 20, 25 and 30°C respectively. This is slightly longer than reported for A. cucumeris by other authors using eggs of Tetranychus mites as prey. The mean egg production was 1.5 ± 0.99 eggs per day. In cold storage tests, after 10 weeks, 63% or A. cucumeris survived at 9°C. 1.2% survived at 2°C and 0°C survived at -8°C.

N2  - A comparison of the biological performance and economic returns from honey bee colonies established in April from either 0.9 kg packages or four-frame nuclei was made in both the Lower Fraser Valley and Peace River areas of British Columbia. In the Lower Fraser Valley, nuclei were superior to packages both biologically and economically, while in the Peace River, no biological differences were found between the two, and packages provided higher economic returns. Either packages or nuclei would be viable in commercial beekeeping operations, depending on individual circumstances.

Methomyl at 1.12 kg (AI)/ha had low residual hazard to honey bees, and at 0.6 kg (AI)/ha it had low residual hazard to leafcutting and alkaki bees after one day. Field tests of methomyl on pollen-shedding corn, blooming red raspberry, and blooming blueberry resulted in reduced bee visitation and low adult bee mortality.

N2  - The western grape leafhopper, Erythroneura elegantula Osborn, and the Virginia creeper leafhopper, Erythroneura ziczac Walsh, were the only species of leafhoppers found colonizing grapevines, Vitis vinifera (L.), in southcentral Washington. Other Cicadalids collected did not colonize. Where the mymarid parasitoid, Anagrus epos, was found, the predominant leafhopper was E. elegantula . In the absence of A. epos , E. ziczac seemed to be the more abundant. E. ziczac quickly dominated a mixed population of both species in a greenhouse. On heavily damaged grape leaves, E. ziczac eggs remained surrounded by green tissue whereas E. elegantula eggs were not. This suggests the presence of a repellent or anti-feedant with E. ziczac eggs. Development time for E. elegantula averaged 402.6 D° which is much shorter than previously published times, and for E. ziczac averaged 390.5 D°.

N2  - This paper describes a method for collecting living, undamaged Agapeta zoegana (L.) moths, especially recently mated females. The objective was to gather this potential biological control agent for subsequent distribution to land infested with knapweeds ( Centaurea spp.) Sweep-netting and baiting techniques were inappropriate collection methods, because the moths were delicate and did not appear to forage. The moths did not move to the plant tops at particular temperatures or times of day and therefore could not easily be collected by aspiration. However, males and virgin and mated females within large field cages were attracted to UV light and, during their daily period of reproductive activity from dusk to midnight, could be collected in a Heliothis trap (Sentry) illuminated by a blacklight. In the open, neither this method nor a mobileblacklight technique were successful in 1988, but both warrant further work. Results are discussed in the context of A. zoegana establishment in B.C.

N2  - Diameter growth response was measured in a mixed stand of lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud, and interior Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii var glauca (Beissn.) Franco, in the Cariboo Forest Region of British Columbia, 14 years after an outbreak of the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, killed 76% of the pine. Nearly all Douglas-fir and a large proportion of the lodgepole pine responded to the beetle-induced thinning with a diameter growth increase which persisted 14 years after the infestation. Douglas-fir trees gained an average 1.4 em or 11.7% in diameter over the estimated size the trees would have reached in the absence of the thinning effect. Annual growth rates of Douglas-fir in the post-outbreak period averaged 2% per year without the beetle-induced thinning and 2.9% after thinning. The surviving lodgepole pine trees gained an average 1 em or 5.4% in diameter over the size the trees would have reached in the absence of the thinning effect. In the post-outbreak period, annual diameter growth rates of the pine doubled from 0.4% per year without the thinning , to 0.8% per year with thinning. The thinning response in Douglas-fir was inversely related to the initial diameter and age of the trees at the start of the infestation but that of pine was not.

N2  - The white pine weevil, Pissodes strobi Peck, is apparently induced to feed and oviposit on the cortex of leaders of Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr, in part through the influence of needles. In laboratory feeding bioassays, mature needles were shown to contain non-volatile feeding deterrents, which probably direct weevils away from them to feed on the bark. In addition, weevils fed more frequently on agar bark discs with spruce needles or toothpicks inserted in them than on control discs, suggesting that the needles have a positive thigmatactic effect on close range host selection.

N2  - No significant differences were found in the numbers of both new and old western hemlock looper eggs per 100 grams of lichen between three crown levels. Representative samples may be collected from lower crown levels with pole pruners, rather than from upper crown levels, which usually involves tree felling. Hot water is more efficient than 2% chlorine bleach for extracting the eggs from the lichen on which they are laid. However, the bleach method is non-destructive and allows the eggs to be reared in order to assess parasitism and fertility. These characteristics can also be identified through egg color using the hot water method , but the parasitoid species cannot be identified. It is recommended that the hot water method be used for forecasting population trends and the bleach method for specific information about parasitoids.

N2  - This paper describes the responsiveness of the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) and the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) to fluorescent and non-fluorescent colored sticky traps in a cucumber greenhouse. As in previous studies, thrips preferred blue, white or yellow painted traps. The fluorescent pigments Horizon Blue, Saturn Yellow and Arc Yellow were not significantly different in attractiveness from non-fluorescent blue and yellow pigments. Whiteflies preferred non-fluorescent yellow, Saturn Yellow, Arc Yellow and Signal Green traps over the other colors tested. Where a single trap color is desired for sampling both pest species, a yellow pigment with high reflective intensity around 550 nm is recommended.

N2  - Populations of A. tombacina were monitored for 2 years at three field sites of varying elevation on Vancouver Island . In 1988, population densities of overwintered adults were greatest at the middle elevation (615m) followed by the highest (830m) and lowest at the low elevation (185m). Egg densities remained below 101m2 at 185m but exceeded 200/m2 in places at 615m and 400/m2 at 830m. Egg mortality was exceedingly high at all sites ranging from 98% at 185m, 95% at 615m and 99% at 830m; very few larvae appeared to survive. Only 2 adults were counted the following spring at the lowest elevation where eggs and larvae were exceedingly difficult to find . No life stages could be found at either of the higher elevation sites. Cold weather early in June, 1988, appeared to be responsible for this population decline. Overwintered adults of A. tombacina were also reared in the laboratory at constant temperatures of 18° and 25°C. The rate of oviposition was greater by a factor of 2 at the higher temperature. The egg-adult survival rate was approximately 15% at 25°C and there was no completed development at 18°. Each larva surviving to pupation consumed a mean of about 28mg. dry weight of leaf.

N2  - A rapid system of sampling for strawberry aphids, Chaetosiphon fragaefolii (Cockerell) was developed for use by pest management scouts. Regression equations relating mean numbers of aphids/leaf, variances of those means and the proportion of unifested leaves (Po) were developed from samples of aphids from single leaves. Using the equations, mean aphid density per leaf and standard errors can be estimated from Po and the sample size. The accuracy of the estimations were tested on data from 155 samples from commercial strawberry fields sampled by a professional pest management company. Means estimated from Po were sufficiently accurate for the intended purpose and only 2 hours were required to sample 300 leaves compared to 16 hours when all aphids on all leaves were counted from only 80 leaves. An electronic recorder was programmed to prompt an IPM scout for data entry, allow correction of errors and permit sampling from different subplots within a field.

Mortality of AM adults was 100% with both rates until 16 days post-treatment. Thereafter, mortality decreased inversely with time. Probit analysis revealed insecticide residual toxicity of 24 days for 95% mortality (ET9S) for both rates, and 51 and 55 days, respectively, for 50% mortality (ETso) at 0.6 and 1.2 g (AI)/1iter. The intercepts and slopes of probit regression were not significantly different for the two rates tested, indicating little difference between their persistence and efficacy against AM adults.

N2  - Populations of the two spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch on strawberry were sampled from 1983-86. The predaceous mite, Amblyseius fallacis (Garman), was predominant. Active adults were observed in February and November, earlier in the spring and later in the autumn than any other predator. Amblyseius fallacis , cecidomyiid flies of Aphidoletes sp. and the ladybird beetle, Stethorus punctum picipes Csy., all responded numerically to introductions of the twospotted mite but A. fallacis responded to the greatest degree. The rate of increase of A. fallacis on a 10& scale was 1.0335 ± 0.0621 per 100 degree-days above 4C (DD4) in the spring and summer, and 0.5481 ±0.0845 per 100 DD4 in late summer, about 2.1 x and 1.6 x per week on an arithmetic scale. Slide dip tests showed that populations of A. fallacis in the Lower Fraser Valley were resistant to the chemical compounds cyhexatin, endosulfan and malathion, partially resistant to diazinon and very susceptible to carbofuran, demeton , dicofol and dimethoate. Biocontrol of T. urticae is discussed in the context of integration with the chemical control of aphids, and predator release rates.

Magdalis gentilis LeConte started to emerge at the beginning of May whereas P. terminalis and one species of Cylindrocopturus emerged a month later. Parasitoids reared from weevil infested terminals belonged to nine species in six families of the Order Hymenoptera. The most important species was the pteromalid Rhopalichus pulchripennis Crawford but two species of Eurytoma collectively ranked second in abundance. Emergence of the majority of the parasitoids preceded that of P. terminalis and Cylindrocopturus sp.

Only one of the species collected, Bourletiella hortensis is a known pest of conifer seedlings, but it is not an obligate phytophage. The presence of sarophagous Collembola and predatory actinedid mites in the samples suggests that pest collembolan species are being controlled naturally by competition for food and by mite predators.

N2  - Unseasonably low temperatures in the fall and winter of 1984 and the fall of 1985 resulted in the decline and termination by 1987 of a major mountain pine beetle infestation which had been in progress since the late 60&#039;s. Following the winter of 1984-85, brood survival on lodgepole pine trees in plots near Tsuh Lake in the west-central Chilcotin area of British Columbia was restricted to the lower 0.5 m of infested boles, and the estimated average emergence of female beetles per tree was about 10% of the number required for replacement of the parent generation. Pine engraver beetle populations which built up during the mountain pine beetle epidemic killed many trees in 1985 and 1986, but collapsed by 1987, due mainly to tree resistance and other natural factors. The rise and fall of tree mortality from the pine engraver within the plots paralleled that in the rest of the central Chilcotin following the collapse of the mountain pine beetle outbreak.

N2  - cis -Verbenol increased catches of male mountain pine beetles, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, to multiple-funnel traps baited with myrcene and exo-brevicomin. cis -Verbenol had no effect on the response of males to traps baited with myrcene, exo-brevicomin and trans-verbenol. In contrast, cis -verbenol increased catches of female D. ponderosae to semiochemical-baited traps irrespective of the absence or presence of trans-verbenol. Our results demonstrate that cis-verbenol is an aggregation pheromone for D. ponderosae and that the combination of cis -and trans -verbenol elicits sex-specific responses.

N2  - Sixteen pheromone traps, baited with (Z,Z,Z)-1,3,6,9-nonadecatetraene, were placed in commercial blueberry and raspberry fields, and at one woodland site in the lower Fraser Valley. Traps were monitored weekly from early November, 1990 until late January, 1991. Winter moth males were recovered from all but the eastern-most trap in Mission. Four traps in blueberry fields in Richmond caught a total of 2,928 winter moths. and 198 were caught in two traps in Delta and Surrey, whereas only 74 came to the ten traps north and cast of Surrey, A total of 1,306 Bruce span worm males were trapped , Although spanworm moths were recovered from traps in all areas. there was no correlation between trap location and number of spanworms caught. Thirteen males with characters intermediate between the two species were trapped in Richmond and Surrey. Male of both species were more numerous in raspberries than in nearby blueberry fields. Spanworm males came to the traps later in the fall than winter moths. East of Richmond, most spanworm males were trapped during November whereas, in Richmond, very few were attracted until the first week of December.

N2  - The presence of metals in mouthparts and claws of some forest insects associated with British Columbia conifers, particularly cone and seed pests, were detected and mapped by energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis. Zinc was concentrated in the mandibular cutting edges and claw tip s of larval lepidopterans (but not in adult mouthparts), in the mandibles and claws of larval and adult coleoplerans and in the mandibles of the hymenopteran, Megastigmus spermatotrophus . Calcium was the predominant metal in the mouth hooks of dipteran larvae. but minor peaks of zinc or manganese were present additionally in two spccies. Manganese occurred in the stylets of the hemipteran, Leptoglossus occidentalis , in the mandibles and claws of one coleopteran species, and with zinc in the mandibles of a clerid predator. The function of metal concentrations in spccific areas of these structures is probably related to hardening of cuticular regions in some instances and to some other biomechanical aspect of cuticular strengthening in other cases.

N2  - In three separate experiments, Douglas-fir beetles, Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins, preferred traps baited with either (S)-(-)- or racemic (R,S)-(±)-frontalin over those baited with the (R)-(+)-enantiomer. Spruce beetles, D. rufipennis (Kirby), appeared to be attracted equally to both the (S)-(-)- and (R)-(+)-enantiomers, but low catches and high variance made interpretation of the data tenuous. For both species racemic frontalin was as attractive as the preferred enantiomer alone. The bark beetle predator, Thanasimus undatulus (Say), was attracted preferentially to (S)-(-)-frontalin over (R)-(+)- or (R,S)-(±)-frontalin in a Douglas-fir stand, while both enantiomers were equally attractive in a spruce stand.

N2  - In 1988, a leafminer, Phyllonorycter mespilella (Hübner) (Lepidoptera:Gracillariidae) was found for the first time in commercial fruit orchards in the Okanagan and Similkameen valleys of British Columbia after apparently moving across the international border from Washington State. Leafminer infestations and parasitoid-induced-leafminer-mortalities were assessed in widespread surveys in the two orcharding areas from 1988 to 1990. Pnigalio flavipes (Hymenoptera:Eulophidae) was the primary parasitoid of the leafminer pest. Three additional parasitoid species associated with the leafminer host in 1990 were: a Sympiesis species, an Eulophus species and a Cirrospilus species (Hymenoptera:Eulophidae). Parasitism reduced intraseasonal leafminer population increase as parasitoid-induced-mortality in the first leafminer generation of 1989 and 1990 was negatively correlated with leafminer density in both the second and third generations of the same year.

N2  - A wireworm survey was conducted at 34 sites in wheat-growing areas of northcentral and northeastern Oregon using a baiting technique. The highest mean number of wireworms found at any site was 4.4 per bait of corn-wheat mixture. When wireworm numbers at each site were used to estimate the population density, some sites had densities high enough to cause yield reduction in spring wheat but not winter wheat. The species were predominantly Ctenicera pruinina (Horn), Limonius californicus (Mannerheim), and Melanotus longulus oregonensis (LeConte), with lesser numbers of Limonius infuscatus Motschulsky, Ctenicera glauca (Germar), Aeolus mellillus (Say), and Dalopius sp. False wireworms (Tenebrionidae) were also found at 10 sites, but their influence is uncertain.

N2  - The black vine weevil, Otiorhynchus sulcatus (Fabricius), is an important pest of hop, Humulus lupulus L., in Idaho. Although some adults survived winter conditions, O. sulcatus overwintered primarily as developing larvae associated with hop root systems 5-50 cm deep in the soil. Primary damage occurred as nearly mature larvae girdled small roots and rhizomes during spring feeding. Pupation began in mid-April with soil temperatures of 15-17°C and concluded in mid- to late May. Adult emergence began in early May and was complete by late May to early June during 1986-1988. The preoviposition period averaged 26 days in the field. The mean number of eggs laid per adult female was 290(22- 1230). Eggs hatched in 12-22 days at 21°C.

N2  - Development of Trypodendron lineatum Oliv. was monitored in a high-grade log boom of Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis , stored in the Alberni Canal, B.C. in 1991. Twenty-eight logs were surveyed at weekly intervals from April 19 to September 13, 1991. By the sixth week all 28 logs had been attacked. Every week, chunks of wood were cut from each attacked log and total of all life stages were recorded. Changes in insect development and the presence or absence of stain were noted. The ratio of brood adults to parental adults was 10: 1 and it was determined that the timing of both parental and brood adult emergence coincided in the "sister" flight. An insect development profile was constructed from these data, and an index was produced for estimating the minimum number of days required to reach specific stages in development. When combined with logging and transportation information, the index provided an estimate of where and when the logs had been attacked. With this information, modifications in management strategies can be reviewed and steps taken to avoid pest populations being transported to storage areas.

N2  - Pheromone-baited multiple funnel traps were set up on a transect to determine the abundance and occurrence of ambrosia beetles over water and land in the Point Grey log boom storage locations on the North Arm of the Fraser River. Beetle collections made from April to September 1991, showed the proportion of Trypodendron lineatum . Gnathotrichus sulcatus and G. retusus beetles were in ratio of 1,054:24:1, respectively. Most of the ambrosia beetles were collected in the forested margin close to the shore line. Although there is no active logging in the adjacent Foreshore and Pacific Spirit Parks, these areas still provide an overwintering refuge to a large number of ambrosia beetles. The transportation of infested log booms to the North Arm of the Fraser and local wind patterns are factors that lead to the build up of beetle numbers in the area.

N2  - Three species of beetles suspected of vectoring the black stain root disease pathogen ( Leptographium wageneri ) were found at two locations on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The most commonly trapped specie was Hylastes nigrinus (Scolytidae) (691) followed by Steremnius carinatus (Curculionidae) (64) and Pissodes fasciatus (Curculionidae) (31). These insects may be vectors of the fungus that induces black stain root disease but confirmatory studies are needed. Douglas-fir resin at 1% or 10% in 95% ethanol attracted the most insects, whereas 95% ethanol or resin alone attracted the fewest. Pitfall traps captured significantly more of all three species than window traps. and were easier to maintain.

N2  - The anobiid, Hemicoelus gibbicollis (LeConte ), is the most serious structure-infesting beetle along the Pacific Coast. This species attacks damp timbers (13-19% moisture content) in crawl spaces. basements, and outbuildings. In structures monitored for anobiids, Douglas- fir. Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel), was the most abundant and readily attacked wood species, but other timbers used in building construction were also infested. Sapwood is more seriously infested than heartwood, and wood of any age can be attacked. Sill plates, rim joists, and headers adjacent to concrete foundations are among the most seriously damaged timbers. Infested buildings ranged from 8 to 122 years old, x-bar = 63.2. Infestations persist for many years. New, air-tight houses built with an abundance of sapwood in construction timbers may be at risk of beetle attack unless moisture levels are kept at a minimum.

N2  - The numbers of adult tuber flea beetles, Epitrix tuberis Gentner, emerging from different soil types in the lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia were compared in 1987 and 1988. Over- wintered beetles (PI) were released at known densities onto caged Russet Burbank potato plants grown in soils with different inorganic, organic, and moisture characteristics. The time from the introduction of PI beetles in June to the mean initial emergence of first generation (FI) beetles ranged from 38 to 47.2 days during the two years of study. The female:male sex ratio of 2210 FI beetles was 1 :0.94, with a slight but significant bias in females early in the emergence period. Although significantly more FI beetles emerged from some highly organic soils than from some mineral soils in both years, inorganic, organic and moisture factors of the test sites did not correlate consistently with the emergence of FI beetles in time or numbers. FI emergence from mineral soils was never significantly greater than that from highly organic soils. This work indicates that the economic injury level derived from studies of PI beetles in highly organic soils could be applied to other soil types with minimal risk to potato crops.

Compounds were identified by coupled gas chromatographic- electroantennographic (GC-EAD) and coupled gas chromatographic-mass spectroscopic (GC-MS) analyses, and were field tested near Prince George, B.C. A 65:35 blend of E11-14 OAc and Z11-14 OAc attracted as many male C. n. sp. CPG as did the most attractive virgin fema1es, suggesting that the natural sex pheromone has only two significant components.

N2  - Responses of an indigenous Trichogramma sp. nr. sibericum (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) to the age and density of eggs of the blackheaded fireworm. Rhopobota naevana (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) were determined in the laboratory. The parasitoid wasp showed a significant (P < 0.05) preference for eggs 1-7-day-old over those 21-day-old. No significant differences (P> 0.05) in percentages of parasitized eggs, however, were found among groups of eggs below 7-day-old. At host egg densities below 20 per wasp, the number of eggs parasitized significantly (P < 0.05) increased with egg density, and tended to stabilize at densities above 30. The rate of parasitism decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with increased host egg density. Superparasitization occurred at densities of 5-10 host eggs, but was rarely observed at densities above 20 eggs. The mean number of progeny per wasp significantly (P < 0.05) increased with host density, whereas the clutch size (the number of parasitoid offspring per parasitized host) significantly (P < 0.05) decreased with an increase in host density.

N2  - Variation in tree height and numbers of attacks by the Sitka spruce weevil (= white pine weevil), Pissodes strohi (Peck), were studied among families of a resistant provenance of Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. at two Vancouver Island sites. At Sayward, after 14 years, the number of trees attacked varied by family from 0 to 80%. A significant association was found between the percentage of trees attacked in a family and the mean height of the family. Tall families were generally attacked more. At Fair Harbour (a clonal test), only 12% of the trees from the resistant provenance have been attacked after seven years, with all but one of the attacks concentrated on one of the two families tested. A multigenic or multicomponent basis for resistance is proposed and discussed.

N2  - Pitfall traps baited with live Pissodes schwarzi Hopk. males plus pine sections captured 46 female P. schwarzi from I June to 1 September, 1989, indicating the presence of a male-produced sex pheromone. No weevils were captured in unbaited traps, or those baited with females on pine or pine sections alone. Seasonal response of P. schwarzi females to the male-baited pifall traps indicated peak. periods of activity in early June, representing overwintered adults, and mid- to late July, corresponding to the emergence of new adults. Development time of P. schwarzi varied depending on oviposition location on the tree. Overwintered brood adults began to oviposit in May and continued through August.

N2  - Ecological field studies often require cages that can withstand adverse weather conditions such as high winds, without greatly altering environmental conditions within them. A large field cage was designed, fabricated and tested for predator-prey studies on raspberry plantings. It consisted of a wood base and screening suspended with loops of canvas from a framework of PVC pipe. The cage withstood gusts above 70 km/h, did not appreciably alter temperature or RH, but did reduce light by 40% and rainfall by 25%. The cage design is simple and can be adapted to many experimental situations.

N2  - Burning alfalfa (Medicago sativa (L.) stubble in the spring has been shown to be effective in reducing some insect pest populations. A study was conducted to detennine the long-tenn effect of this practice on seed yield. Plots were established at Lethbridge, Alberta, and burned in the spring or fall at various heights of plant growth from 1983 to 1989, with one half of each plot treated annually with insecticides when the pest insects were in their most vulnerable stage. Yields from burned treatments were not significantly different from unburned ones for the years 1983 to 1986, and 1988. In 1987, treatments burned in the fall had significantly higher yields than other treatments. Burning at 15-20 cm of growth significantly reduced yield compared to burning before spring growth. In 1989, yields from plots burned at 15-20 cm of growth were significantly lower than those burned every fall or spring. Insecticide treated plots had significantly higher yields in all years except 1983. Burning in the fall, or in the spring before growth, increased gross economic returns, but insecticide treatment gave the highest returns.

N2  - Densities and damage by twospotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae Koch and levels of phytoseiid mites on hops were assessed in 34 commercial fields and at 11-19 sites of escaped hops in the Willamette valley of western Oregon in 1991-1992. Amblyseius fallacis (Garman), Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten, Amblyseius andersoni Chant and Metaseiulus occidentalis (Nesbitt) were most common. On escaped hops, T. pyri was more common than other phytoseiids. It occurred widely on plants surrounding commercial hops including blackberry and other rosaceous plants and probably is a vagrant on escaped hops. A. fallacis was most common in commercial hops making up 88% of all specimens, followed by many fewer M. occidentalis and T. pyri. Early spring survival of A Jallacis in commercial hops was poor because of certain cultural practices used in the spring. Means to improve biological control of spider mites on hops are discussed including amended methods of hop culture, use of selective pesticides and inoculative releases of predaceous mites.

N2  - Daily emergence of the mountain pine beetle from lodgepole pine trees was monitored in the field by using caged bolts and by counting emergence holes on standing trees. Flying mountain pine beetles, pine engraver beetles and Pityogenes plagiatus knechteli (Swaine) were captured daily in two types of barrier traps. Daily totals of emergence holes and emergence into cages were moderately correlated with daily captures by both types of barrier traps. A simple model of daily emergence was developed based on estimates of brood density, daily proportions of brood adults, and daily proportions of brood adults ready to emerge. Daily catches of pine engravers and P. plagiatus knechteli were highly intercorrelated, but correlations with catches of mountain pine beetle were low for both species. The results are discussed in relation to beetle emergence and flight behaviour.

N2  - Effects of female mating status and age of Trichogramma minutum Riley on its fecundity, longevity and offspring sex ratio were detennined in the laboratory, using eggs of the variegated cutworm as hosts. Although the mating status of female T. minutum did not affect their total fecundity significantly (P > 0.05), mated and unmated females showed different allocations of progeny. Mated females deposited significantly more eggs (P < 0.05) than those unmated on the first day of exposure to hosts. On subsequent days, however, unmated females parasitized significantly more hosts (P < 0.05) than those mated. Mated females laid 82.4% of their total fecundity on the first day of oviposition, whereas unmated females laid 58.3%. The number of eggs parasitized by both groups of females decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with parasitoid age. Unmated females lived longer (P < 0.05) than their mated counterparts. No significant differences (P> 0.05) in clutch size (the number of parasitoid offspring produced per parasitized host) and emergence rate were found between the offspring of mated and unmated female parasitoids. The sex ratio of the offspring of mated females changed significantly (P < 0.05) with maternal age: younger females produced a higher proportion of daughters than did older parasitoids. Unmated females produced male offspring only.

N2  - Insect populations in alfalfa grown for hay can be sampled using several methods. However, in a pest management program a relatively easy, quick, and reliable method of sampling is essential for making effective pest control decisions. A study was conducted to determine if two different sampling methods, sweepnet sampling and suction sampling, led to similar pest control decisions. Differences between sweepnet and D-Vac insect population estimates varied over sampling dates and years and were dependent on the insect species, their developmental stages, and abiotic factors. Our results indicate that, for many sampling dates, decisions on control of some pest insects would be similar for the two sampling methods.

N2  - The biological control of twos potted spider mites by the predator Phytoseiulus persimilis is usually unsuccessful on greenhouse tomato crops in British Columbia. Experiments were conducted to determine the influence of host plant on the longevity and reproduction of the predator, and on the suitability of twospotted spider mites as prey. Lifespan and reproduction of P. persimilis were lower on tomato leaves than on bean leaves but feeding on spider mites that had been reared on tomato or bean leaves had no effect on the reproduction or lifespan of P. persimilis. A strain of twospotted spider mites that came from an outbreak on a greenhouse tomato crop lived for shorter periods and laid fewer eggs when confined on tomato leaves than on bean leaves. A strain of twospotted spider mites that had been maintained on bean leaves was unable to reproduce on tomato leaves. Exudates from glandular hairs were toxic to P. persimilis. Glandular hairs are important in pest management on tomato crops. Their removal through breeding might make plants more susceptible to herbivores. Therefore it would be preferable to develop other methods for biological control of twospotted spider mites on tomato.

N2  - An algorithm to forecast occurrence of four life-stage categories of the alfalfa weevil, Hypera postica (Gyllenhal), was derived from data collected in fields of seed alfalfa, Medicago sativa (L.) in southern Alberta. The algorithm assumes a linear developmental response to mean daily temperatures above a threshold of 10C. Overwintering adults were active after the accumulation of 100 degree-days above 10C (DD10), and were scarce by 250-300 DD10. Early larvae (instars 1 + 2) were found beginning at 120 DD10 and their numbers peaked at 200 DD10. Late larvae (instars 3 + 4) were present beginning at 160 DD10 and their numbers peaked at 350 DD10. New generation adults appeared after 500 DD10. In southern Alberta, alfalfa seed production is frequently combined with honey production. This algorithm enables producers to forecast the occurrence of the most damaging stage of alfalfa weevils which may require control with insecticides; the advance notice enables optimal timing of treatment and also allows apiarists to minimize pesticide mortality by moving or confining their bees.

N2  - Insect pest and natural enemy populations were evaluated during the 1990 growing season in five paired certified organic and conventional apple orchards in the Yakima Valley, Washington. Each orchard pair was managed by one grower and had similar conditions of location, extent, cultivars, and tree density. Organic orchards had not been treated with synthetic insecticides for 1-2 years before this study. Fruit injury from codling moth and population densities of phytophagous mites, sucking bugs, rosy apple and green aphids, leafminers, leafhoppers, and selected natural enemies were monitored throughout the season. Damage from codling moth was over 3% in three of the five organic orchards. Densities of phytophagous mites were high in one conventional orchard at the end of the season. Organic orchards had significantly higher populations of sucking bugs at bloom than did conventional orchards. There was no significant difference between orchard types in the densities of rosy apple aphid colonies per tree, but colonies in conventional orchards had significantly more aphids and significantly less parasitism than in organic orchards. The population density of green aphids was higher in conventional than organic orchards during the second half of the season. There was little difference in numbers of adult leafhoppers caught on sticky traps between orchard types, but captures of a leafhopper egg parasite were significantly higher in organic than in conventional orchards throughout the season. Immature leafminer populations were significantly higher and parasitism of leaf miner was significantly lower in conventional than organic orchards after July. Parasitism of codling moth was not found in any orchard. Key words: Codling moth; organic; apple; pest management; aphid; mite; leafhopper; leafminer; egg parasite

The study was undertaken in the Prince George Forest Region where the weevil causes extensive damage to plantations of interior white spruce. Annual attack rates decreased significantly with increased brush cover. The treatment with side shade was achieved using narrow strip cuts running east and west. Side and overstory shade also reduced annual growth. Results indicate that up to 6% reductions in annual attack rates could be expected for at least 5 years following treatment but that differences in attack rates between treatments took at least three years to appear.

N2  - In 1991, orchards in the Naramata region of the Okanagan valley in British Columbia had significantly larger populations of the leafminer, Phyllonorycter mespilella, than those of the Osoyoos/Oliver region, 50 km south, where parasitism had been shown to keep the miner below treatment levels. We questioned if different roles of the parasitoid species caused the discrepancy. Leaves were collected and leafminers and parasitoids assessed from overwintering populations and also weekly from May through October (1992) in apple orchards representative of the areas. Pnigalio flavipes and Sympiesis marylandensis were the major parasitoid species overwintering in 52.3 and 46.7% respectively of the P. mespilella mines. The percentages of the two species did not diITer significantly between the orchards screened in both areas and did not account for the differences in the numbers of overwintering or summer generation mines. P. flavipes was the dominant parasitoid species in both regions through the three summer generations. S. marylandensis was only found at low levels in three of the eight orchards until the second and third generations.

Best survival of those that emerged as adults (16-32 %) was on ox-tail bones and ground beef. The majority of the larvae in each generation remained quiescent or did not pupate for up to six months which probably indicates an obligatory overwintering diapause in this species.

N2  - Phytoseiuius persimilis was released to control the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, in field raspberries at Agassiz, B.C. The mite predators became established and responded numerically to the prey in the treatment plots. For a period of 8 weeks after release, the numbers of T. urticae were consistently lower in the treatment plots than in the controls. Differences in numbers of T. urticae between the treatments and the controls were significant on two dates.

N2  - Commercial sticky board traps (150 x 100 mm) of three different colors (blue, white or yellow) were treated with one of two chemical attractants (p-anisaldehyde and ethyl nicotinate) and with the solvent ethanol. Blue and white traps caught four and three times more thrips respectively than yellow traps. Attractants improved catches by only about 20% and were not considered economical. If traps are used, a plain blue trap is recommended. Trapping, beating tray and flower cluster flicking monitoring methods were compared. Trapping gave a time-averaged indication of thrips numbers, but numbers are probably affected by location of the trap and flowering stage of the apple. The beating tray method was the most versatile. It could be used regardless of flower condition and produced instant results. The currently recommended flower cluster flicking method produced few thrips and is affected by condition and age of the flowers, as well as time of day. We conclude that it is an ineffective method. Monitoring thrips numbers after blossom using a beating tray may give more practical economic thresholds for treatment. Key words: thrips; apples; Frankliniella occidentalis

N2  - Rates of honeydew production were lower in diapausing winterform pear psylla, Cacopsylla pyricola (Foerster), than in psylla brought out of diapause by exposure either to long-day conditions or to an insect growth regulator (fenoxycarb). An extract obtained from a nonhost species, buffalo gourd (Cucurbita foetidissima HBK.), caused reduced honeydew production when misted onto pear shoots. Reductions in feeding were as pronounced in diapausing insects as in psylla that were in a postdiapause condition. Ovarian development scores were positively correlated with honeydew production, indicating that feeding deterrents may be useful for delaying the onset of egglaying in the field.

N2  - A Douglas-fir beetle outbreak in Jasper National Park was discovered at 10 sites in 1991, and has since expanded to 30 sites in 1992, and 55 sites in 1993. Individual sites surveyed in 1993 contained from 3 to more than 200 attacked trees covering areas of 10 m2 to 1 km2 respectively. Sites containing pheromone population monitoring funnel traps contained significantly more attacked live trees than those sites without pheromone traps, suggesting that the traps attract larger beetle populations to the site. Diameter measurements indicated that in the initial years (-1990) of the infestation, larger diameter trees were attacked more commonly. In 1993, freshly attacked green trees were of a smaller diameter.

N2  - From 1991 to 1993, pheromone-based mating disruption for control of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) was evaluated in seven apple orchards. Each pheromone-treated orchard was paired with a similar orchard without pheromone. Populations of codling moth, secondary pests, and selected natural controls were monitored. The cost of using pheromone dropped nearly $100 per ha from 1991-1993 because of reductions in the price of dispensers and improved application. Growers saved $87-147 in insecticides per ha in pheromone-treated orchards, because of an 83% reduction in sprays for codling moth, but savings from reduced labor and machinery costs in treated orchards were minimal. Damage from codling moth was high in one treated orchard in 1991 (7.4%), and increased to 20.8% in 1992. The population density of codling moth was low in the other orchards (fruit injury < 0.4%) in all three years. Insecticide applications after petal-fall for secondary pests were reduced by 18% in treated orchards. Populations of secondary pests were similar between orchard pairs. Among natural controls only parasitism of leafrniners differed significantly between treated and untreated orchards. In 1991, leafrollers caused > 3% fruit injury in three of seven treated orchards, but were not a problem thereafter. Substituting mating disruption for insecticides to manage codling moth in apple orchards may therefore be successful, but for the first three years, may not substantially improve biological control of secondary pests.

N2  - The potential range of gypsy moth in British Columbia is predicted from climatic comparisons to its native range in Eurasia and by using temperature- dependent phenological models of the life stages. The cool and wet coastal areas, northern B.C., and high elevations are predicted to be unsuitable for gypsy moth. Southeastern Vancouver Island, parts of the lower mainland, and southern interior valleys appear to have suitable climates. However, the availability of preferred hosts may limit establishment in some of these areas. Habitats with Garry oak are of particular concern, since it is the most suitable native tree species and is already threatened by urban development.

N2  - Provincial and state records for a sample of insect groups from British Columbia, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington show that this region, here termed "the Pacific Northwest", contains about 29% of North American insect diversity, a level that can be extrapolated to suggest that about 26,000 reported species occur in the region. Nearly half of these species are widely distributed in North America. Many species are more-or-less broadly western; 13% of all species essentially are confined to the Pacific Northwest, although some of them occur otherwise only in California, which contains many Pacific Northwestern species, especially in the north. Most of the fauna of British Columbia occurs also in the United States part of the region, and one-third of the species confined in Canada to British Columbia occur also in Idaho, Oregon or Washington. Despite these overall trends, there are wide differences among families and among genera, reflecting the diverse ranges, origins and ecological relationships of the different groups. Detailed studies that would more fully explain the differences are limited, even for groups of North American insects that are taxonomically better known. Nevertheless, the simple but feasible analysis of state and provincial records presented here provides useful indexes of regional occurrence, and indicates groups in the region that are of particular interest.

N2  - Larval feeding rates, growth rates of imrnatures, and adult fecundities were measured for Colorado potato beetle fed hairy nightshade (Solanum sarrachoides) or potato (Solanum tuberosum). Hairy nightshade is an important economic weed in local agriculture. The larvae consumed more dry weight of potato foliage than nightshade. Developmental rate was higher for larvae fed potato than for those fed nightshade. Mortality was similar on the two hosts. Pupae and adults obtained from larvae reared on nightshade were significantly heavier than those from larvae reared on potato. There were no significant effects of the rearing host on adult female longevity. Fecundity, however, was higher for beetles fed on nightshade than those fed on potatoes. We conclude that hairy nightshade is an important alternative and acceptable host plant for the Colorado potato beetle.

The two photo-scales were then interpreted by two different sets of photo-interpreters, with varying degrees of experience, and compared to ground surveys. Results showed that the use of skilled photo-interpreters improved the accuracy of interpretation of current weevil attacks by 18% to 79% over the use of unskilled interpreters. A significant relationship was also observed between the amount of red foliage remaining on the leader and the accuracy of interpretation of current attacks. Large-scale 70 mm photography can detect currently attacked spruce leaders as small as 35 by 30 cm with an accuracy approaching 90% providing at least 30% of the red needles remain on the damaged leader and experienced photo-interpreters assess the results.

N2  - The distribution of a predatory mite, Galandronus occidentalis, was determined along with its prey, the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, at five elevations on unsprayed hops grown on a 5-6 m trellis. The prey species was well established at all elevations when the study began on July 20, 1993. The predator did not reach the uppennost elevations sampled until two weeks later. Early in the study whole plant predator:prey ratios were 1:90 or more compared to 1 :20 in late August. Counts of hop aphids, Phorodon humuli Schrank, were also made. At high densities, hop aphids and resultant honeydew on leaves interfere with mite population development. Aphid densities of 100 or more/leaf occurred during the last three weeks of this study and reduced mite numbers.

N2  - A botanical insecticide based on extracts of seeds from the neem tree, Azadirachta indica A. Juss, was applied systemically to Sitka spruce and white-Engelmann spruce hybrids and sprayed directly onto the leaders of white-Engelmann spruce to test its efficacy in controlling the white pine weevil, Pissodes strobi Peck. Neither treatment had any effect on weevils or damage in the white-Enge1mann spruce, and control was not economical. Key words: neem; weevil; azadirachtin

N2  - Seasonal flight activity of the speckled green fruitworm, Orthosia hibisci Guenee, was monitored from 1990 - 1993 with a commercial sex attractant in Pherocon 1-C sticky traps and UV light-traps hung in unsprayed apple orchards in the Okanagan (Summerland and Kelowna) and Similkameen Valleys (Cawston). Flights in the Similkameen began in late February each year but not before the second week of March in the Okanagan. Catches with sex attractant peaked around the end of March or early April in the Similkameen and peaked about 5 - 14 days later in the Okanagan. Males were caught earlier in light-traps than in sex-attractant traps, but females were caught in light traps about 6 days after the first males were caught with the sex-attractant. After this time lag, female catches in light traps paralleled male catches. Moths were caught in light traps for 1 - 2 weeks after catches with sex attractants had ended. Weibull functions were fitted to curves of cumulative percent catch with sex-attractant traps plotted against days or degree-days above 3°C air temperature (DD3°C) using Summerland traps. Among models fitted to the Summerland data, one using DD3°C after 1 January was the best predictor of flight activity in Kelowna and Cawston, where the errors in predicting 50% catch were about 1 and 2 days, respectively. A model using the date of first catch in a sex-attractant trap to start DD summations, called the biofix because it serves as a biological indicator of moth activity, predicted 50% catch within 3 - 4 days. The biofix model is recommended because it provides biological realism and less chance for error in years with unusual weather conditions. Models fitted to 10 data sets combined, predict that 50% catch will occur 166 DD3°C after 1 January, and 96 DD3°C after biofix, respectively. These models should aid in timing pest control measures, especially biorational pesticides that require accurate information on insect phenology to be most effective.

N2  - Pheromone-mediated mating disruption to control codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), was tested in commercial apple and pear orchards in 1991 and 1992 using Isomate-C® dispensers. In 1991, a single treatment of 1000 dispensers/ha released the pheromone, E,E-8,10-dodecadien-1-ol (codlemone), calculated rates of 14.9, 15.2, 16.6 and 17.5 gm/ha from 1 May to 30 September in Kelowna, Summerland, Cawston and Oliver, respectively. At the same four sites, but during the 1-hr dusk flight periods, when most mating occurs, codlemone was released at calculated median rates of 7.6, 8.2, 8.3 and 12.7 mg/ha/h during first brood and 2.4, 23, 4,7 and 53 mg/ha/h during second brood, respectively. Damage in 22 pheromone-treated apple orchards ranged from 0.02 - 6.75%, with a median of 042%, whereas damage in 12 pheromone-treated pear orchards ranged from 0.02 - 6.23%, with a median of 0.87%. Three insecticide-treated apple orchards had a mean of 0.06% damage and one insecticide-treated pear orchard had 4.21% damage. Untreated apple and pear orchards had 56.9 and 2.23% damage, respectively. In pheromone-treated orchards, few male codling moths were caught in Pherocon 1-C wing traps baited with 1 mg of codlemone (x=2.9 moths/trap/orchard/season) compared with identical traps hung in insecticide-treated orchards (x=29.2 moths/trap/orchard/season). Traps baited with 10 mg of codlemone caught codling moths in 96% of the pheromone-treated apple orchards and weekly catches showed seasonal flight patterns similar to those in insecticide-treated orchards. A signifieant linear relationship between mean cumulative catches in traps baited with 10 mg of codlemone during night of tirst-brood moths and damage at harvest, can be used to warn growers if mating disruption is failing and that additional treatment may be needed for the second brood. In 1992, treatment of apple orchards in Cawston with 1000 dispensers/ha as a single application on 1 May, released codlemone at calculated median rates of 13.3 and 4.6 mg/ha/h during first and second brood, respectively. A split application of 650 dispensers on 1 May and an additional 350 on 1 July released codlemone at median rates of 8.7 and 7.8 mg/ha/h during first and second broods, respectively. Damage in 5 orchards with a single pheromone treatment ranged from 0 - 1.52%, and 2 orchards with the split application had 0.08 and 0.97% damage. Damage in an untreated control orchard was 43.5%. Used as described here, pheromone-mediated mating disruption using Isomate-C® is commercially viable in British Columbia.

In 20 orchards we found only spirea aphids; in 11, most were spirea aphids and in 2, all were apple aphids ( A. pomi deGeer). In 1995, 76% of those examined were spirea aphids. In 13 orchards we found only spirea aphids; in 22, most aphids were spirea; in one, all, and in 6 most, were apple aphids. In the two years combined, 33 orchards (44%) had only spirea aphids, 33 (44%) had predominantly spirea aphids, 6 (8%) had mainly apple aphids and 3 (4%) had only apple aphids. There were no clear differences in distribution of the two species over time or on different apple cultivars. Key words: Aphid; Spirea ; apple; orchard

We measured and compared their rates of growth in bolts of lodgepole pine and in living trees: Ophiostoma ips from Ips pini against 0. clavigerum from Dendroctonus ponderosae . We measured the length of lesions shown by discolored xylem, but we found both fungi outside of visibly stained areas, which showed that mere staining is not a reliable indicator of fungal growth. There were no significant differences in brood development or survival between the two beetle spp., when bolts were inoculated with either fungal associate.

N2  - The arthropods of the Osoyoos - Mt. Kobau area (119° 40&#039; W, 49° OS&#039; N) in the southern Okanagan valley of BC were surveyed in the summer of 1991. Mt. Kobau is a high ridge with south-facing slopes covered in grassland and sagebrush from valley bottom to summit. A variety of insect traps and active collecting techniques was used to obtain the greatest possible diversity of arthropod species in the samples. Collections were made in a roughly vertical transect of Mt. Kobau from 300m at Osoyoos to the summit at 1861 m. Eighty-eight samples were sorted to select the greatest number of taxa possible. A total of 5566 specimens was prepared for identification and of this, 5023 were identified to species (or morphospecies) by March, 1994. We collected at least 1101 species, including 12 new distributional records for Canada, 15 new distributions for BC, 30 possible new records for Canada and 14 possible new records for BC, 2 new spccies, and 84 specics considered rare, restricted or potentially endangered. Most of the rare species and records were found at low elevations and are typical of deserts and arid sagebrush grasslands of the Great Basin and Columbia Plateau to the south. Comparison of catches made by different collecting techniques indicates that pantraps catch the most specics and are the most cost effective.

N2  - Eggs, larvae, and pupae of the blow fly Calliphora vicina reared normally at 24°C were kept for 24 h at an ambient temperature of 3.0±0.14°C during growth and development. This was to stimlate the chilling of insects before their collection from cadavers in a morgue at 3°C in forensic entomology cases. Such treatment of any stage induced a 24 h delay in adult emergence because the insects did not appear to develop while chilled. No mortality occurred in any stage, including eggs and 1st instar larvae, during chilling. This information is important for, and should improve the accuracy of forensic investigations.

N2  - Z-6-heneicosen-11-one, the major synthetic component of the sex pheromone of Douglas-fir tussock moth, Orgyia pseudotsugata (McDunnough), was used to disrupt insect mating. Dosages of 72, 36, 18, and 9 g/ha of the synthetic pheromone in polyvinyl chloride beads were each applied to three 2-ha plots using conventional aerial spray equipment. Observation of the spraying operation, and catches of male moths in traps baited with standardized synthetic pheromone indicated that two of the 12 plots were not completely sprayed. The efficacy of mating disruption was monitored over the 9 weeks following spraying, using traps baited with feral females interspersed among the standardized traps. When trap catches by feral females in the two unsprayed plot sections were discarded, the mean catch increased as the synthetic dosage decreased. These catches compared with those in the untreated plots were reduced ovcr 99.5% in plots treated with dosages of 72, 36, or 18 g/ha; and by 97.5% with a dosage of 9 g/ha of synthetic pheromone. In our experimental conditions, the difference in numbers of trapped males among the 72, 36, 18, and 9 g/ha dosage groups was marginally nonsignificant. Our data thus indicate that in operational use, dosages near or below 9 g/ha would be significantly different in effectiveness from the 3 higher dosages.

N2  - Studies were conducted to characterize the sexual biology of Argyrotaenia citrana (Fernald) and to evaluate the potential of sex pheromones to disrupt moth communication. Both males and females are sexually active during their first scotophase. Virgin females start calling 3 hrs into scotophase and continue until sunrise. Calling frequency by virgins is lower during the first than in subsequent nights. Females generally mate once during a scotophase. Calling is reduced after mating for one scotophase and then increases though mated females continue to call less frequently than virgins. Peak calling by mated females is delayed several hours compared with virgins. Females may remate after 1-3 days. Males can mate more than once per scotophase. Oviposition is concentrated during early scotophase. Females laid an average of five egg masses. Communication and mating disruption were evaluated in replicated 0.1 ha plots and 100 m2 field cages treated with field-aged polyethylene tube dispensers releasing 0.7-1.2 mg/d of either (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate alone or in a 15:1 blend with (Z)-11-tetradecenal. Mating of tethered females in field cages and catches of lure and female-baited traps in small field plots were nearly completely disrupted with the two component blend. Dispensers emitting only the acetate pheromone were less effective in disrupting moth communication in similar tests.

Sentinel females were placed individually on mating tables on eight different nights during July 1996. The percentage of mated females ranged from 20-100%, with an average of 55.8% (n = 47). One female died and only three escaped. Females of the obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), also mated when placed on the tables in the field, suggesting that the table may have potential for use with many species, particularly those that are too small to be tethered.

This collection increases its northern range and represents the most northerly collection of any member of the family Petaluridae. While no larvae were collected, it is likely that the muskegs that occur in thc Kowesas River valley serve as the larval habitat. This distribution record supports thc prediction that Tanypteryx hageni is not restricted to mountain habitats, hut rather is a resident in low-elevation coastal forests in the northern part of its range.

N2  - The development times of Echinothrips americanus (Morgan) (Thysanoptera:Thripidae) on greenhouse peppers and cucumbers were determined, and commercially available predators of thrips were evaluated as potential biological controls for this pest. Development times on cucumber were 15.6 d ± 1.8, 3.6 d ± 0.8, 2.1 d ± 0.4, and 5.2 d ± 0.9 for egg, first-instar, second-instar and pupa, respectively. Development times on pepper were 15.0 d ± 2.1, 6.0 d ± 2.1, 5.5 d ± 1.2, and 5.2 d ± 1.0 for egg, first-instar, second-instar and pupa, respectively. Development from egg to adult took 26.5 d on cucumber and 31.7 d on pepper. The development time for the pest on pepper is about 20% longer than on cucumber. The predators, Orius insidiosus (Say) (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae), Amblyseius cucumeris (Oudemans) (Acarina:Phytoseiidae) and Amblyseius degenerans (Berlese) (Acarina: Phytoseiidae) were compared on E. americanus . Orius insidiosus significantly reduced thrips populations, but the two predator mite species did not. Our results indicate that O. insidiosus has the most potential as a biocontrol agent.

Our objective was to identify predators that might be used for the biological control of spider mites in greenhouse tomato crops. Three to four pots of bean plants infested with spider mites were exposed each week at each of three locations from early April through to October, in both 1992 and 1993. Predators were collected from these trap plants, identified and tested as potential of spider mites. Twenty-two species were collected, more than half of them predatory Hemiptera. Two species, Feltiella acarisuga (Vallot) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), Stethorus punctum picipes (Casey) (Coleoptem: Coccinellidae) were specialist predators of spider mites. Feltiella acarisuga was the most promising candidate for use in and biological control of spider mites (on tomatoes) based on the frequency with which it occurred on trap plants, its cosmopolitan distribution, and its monophagous feeding habits.

N2  - We estimated the threshold temperature for development of Trypodendron lineatum (Oliv.). Western hemlock logs were inoculated with reproductively active beetles. Beetles developing inside them were reared in temperature controlled chambers at 18, 20, 25 and 30°C. Similar logs were set up outdoors. The outdoor, 25 and 30°C logs were replaced with field attacked logs when the inoculated beetles failed to establish. Sample disks were cut from each log every 6 days and dissected to fmd the number of all life stages. Beetles reared at 25 and 30°C developed more slowly than those outdoors or at 18 or 20°. Development rates in the 18 and 20°C chambers were used to calculate a threshold temperature of 13°C. We estimated that brood and parental beetles would emerge from the logs after accumulation of 265 degree-days above the 13°C threshold.

N2  - Applications of the insect growth regulator fenoxycarb in pear before the appearance of foliage kills the eggs of pear psylla, Cacopsylla pyricola (Foerster), laid on newly expanded foliage 4 weeks after the application. We hypothesized that water in the form of rainfall or overhead irrigation transports the product from sprayed wood onto new foliage in sufficient amounts that eggs on foliage are killed. We tested this hypothesis by covering fenoxycarb-sprayed limbs with waterproof plastic, removing the covers 4 weeks later, immediately drenching half of the limbs with water, and then comparing egg hatch on drenched and non-drenched limbs. We also monitored egg hatch on uncovered limbs. Egg mortality 4 weeks after the application was two-fold higher on limbs drenched with water than on covered, non-drenched limbs (52% vs 26%). Mortality on limbs without fenoxycarb was less than 10%. Eggs deposited on fenoxycarb-treated but uncovered limbs also showed high rates of mortality (33-44%), which may have been due to rainfall in mid-April transporting fenoxycarb onto foliage.

Thanasimus undatulus was attracted to frontalin and a-pinene, the commercial spruce beetle lure, alone or combined with the D. affaber pheromones (+)-endo- and (±)-exo-brevicomin. Ips tridens pheromones, (±)- and (+)-ipsdienol, significantly increased the numbers of T. undatulus attracted to spruce beetle lures. Additional I. tridens pheromone components, (-)-cis-verbenol and amitinol, did not increase attraction to spruce beetle lures with added (±)-ipsdienol. Attraction to I. tridens pheromones indicates that baiting susceptible hosts with I. tridens pheromones to induce competitive exclusion of the spruce beetle may also lead to increased densities of the natural enemy, T. undatulus .

N2  - We examined the suitability of the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), as a host for Aphelinus asychis Walker. The solitary parasitoid, A. asychis imported from France, has adapted to M. persicae reared on potatoes in the laboratory. Females deposited about 95 eggs over 21 d in various stages of the aphid including alates. The mean emergence was 83.3%, and the highest 92.3%. The longevity of female adult parasitoids was about 20 d. Total larval developmental time (14.5 d) was shorter than the adult longevity of females. Parasitoid larvae inside M. persicae mummies were less susceptible to the selective aphicide pirimicarb than to the broad spectrum chemicals, methamidophos and disulfoton. The mean daily emergence (6.1 %) and cumulative emergence (73.3%) from mummies treated by pirimicarb were significantly higher than those from mummies treated by metharnidophos (4.1 and 49.2%) and disulfoton (0.6 and 6.7%). The high fecundity and emergence, and reduced susceptibility of A. asychis to the pirimicarb show its potential as a biological control agent in integrated pest management programs for green peach aphid.

N2  - Carabid beetles were sampled in 15 raspberry fields in the Fraser Valley of BC from April to September, 1994. At least 28 species were caught, but one, Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger), dominated with 80% of all individuals. Eight of the nine most numerous species (>200 individuals caught) were introduced in North America. Significant, 30-fold differences were detected between fields with respect to abundance of seven of these species. The differences could not be attributed to soil type, type of habitat at the edge of the field nearest the traps, or spray history. A sampling protocol for pest managers was developed in which 1 to 3 consecutive weekly samples during July provide a relative index of annual abundance of P. melanarius throughout the season. Traps should be set at a standard distance from the edge of a field because numbers increase with distance from the edge. At least 10 traps per field are required for reasonable precision.

N2  - A small-scale field experiment was conducted near Prince George to evaluate the effectiveness of topical treatments with CO2 and liquid N2 for killing brood in lodgepole pine trees infested with the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopk. (Coleoptera: Scolytidae). CO2 and liquid N2 caused significant (p < 0.05) mortality of approximately 40% and 60 - 63 % of larvae and adults, respectively. About $263 and $67 worth of N2 and CO2, respectively, would be needed to treat 1.5 m of the trunk of an infested tree. The low mortality and high treatment costs make freezing uneconomical compared to the alternatives of monosodium methane arsonate or felling and burning.

N2  - Predation on eggs of codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., was assessed in Washington in June and August, 1995 in eight apple orchards treated with organophosphate insecticides (OPs), four orchards treated with mating disruption (MD) and some OPs, and four treated with MD but not with OPs. Sentinel codling moth eggs laid by caged moths on 10 shoots in each orchard were scored as alive, dead, or missing after 7 d, and beating tray samples of arthropod predators were collected at the beginning and end of each trial. Levels of egg predation (dead + missing eggs) did not differ significantly among orchard types in June but varied among orchard types in August (MD alone> MD + OPs > OPs). The percentage of dead eggs in August was significantly higher in the orchards receiving only MD than in orchards treated only with OPs. The percentage of missing eggs was significantly lower both months in orchards not treated with MD. Densities of spiders and all predators on both sample dates and for earwigs in August were significantly higher in orchards not treated with OPs. Densities of heteropteran predators did not vary significantly by orchard type. No significant correlations were found among predator densities and egg mortality within an orchard type. However, the percentages of dead eggs and dead plus missing eggs were significantly and positively correlated with densities of earwigs, spiders, and all predators in tray samples across the 16 orchards.

N2  - The effects of cold storage on Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman pupae, in darkness at 2.0 ± 0.5°c and 100% R.H. for 0 to 10 weeks, were determined on adult emergence, adult longevity, the number of eggs laid per female, and egg viability in the laboratory. The proportion of adults emerging was not significantly reduced after pupae were stored in the cold room for up to 2 weeks. No adults emerged from pupae being stored for 8 weeks or longer. The lifespan of adult females was longer than that of males. The differences in adult longevity between the two sexes increased after pupae were exposed to cold storage. Cold storage of C. occidentalis pupae significantly reduced adult longevity: longer pupal storage resulted in a shorter adult lifespan. After 1 week of cold storage of the pupae, the mean number of eggs laid per female and egg viability were not significantly reduced as compared with those for females not exposed to cold storage as pupae. Egg production and egg viability, however, were significantly reduced when pupae were subjected to cold storage for 2 weeks or longer. Considering all the parameters measured, pupae may be exposed to cold storage for 1 week without deterioration in adult quality.

N2  - Experiments were conducted to test the null hypothesis that green leaf volatiles, abundant in herbaceous plants and angiosperm trees, have no effect on the response by the conifer-infesting ambrosia beetle, Gnathotrichus retusus (LeConte), to pheromonebaited traps. A blend of four green leaf alcohols, 1-hexanol, (E)-2-hexen-1-ol, (Z)-2-hexen-1-ol, and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, each released at ca. 4 mg per 24 h, combined with a blend of two green leaf aldehydes, hexanal and (E)-2-hexenal, each released at ca. 13.0 mg per 24 h, reduced catches of females to levels not significantly different from those in unbaited control traps. Any of the four green leaf alcohols released alone disrupted responses of females, while 1-hexanol and (E)-2-hexen-1-ol strongly reduced catches of males. The two green leaf aldehydes released together, and (E)-2-hexenal released alone, weakly enhanced trap catches. These results lead to rejection of the null hypothesis on the basis of both positive and negative effects. Disruptive green leaf volatiles may have promise as forest product protectants against ambrosia beetles, by disguising hosts as non-hosts.

N2  - We tested the hypothesis that green leaf volatiles (GLVs) disrupt the response of spruce beetles, Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby, and western pine beetles, Dendroctonus brevicomis LeConte, to attractant-baited traps. Two green leaf aldehydes, hexanol and (E)-2-hexenal, reduced the number of spruce beetles captured to intermediate levels and one green leaf alcohol, hexanol, significantly reduced spruce beetle trap catches. Together, the green leaf alcohols and aldehydes reduced trap catches by 78.7 and 89.3% for males and females, rcspectively. The green leaf aldehyde, (E)-2-hexenal, and two green leaf alcohols, (E)-2-hexen-1-ol and (Z)-2-hexen-1-ol, significantly reduced the numbers of male western pine beetles captured and the latter compound also reduced the numbers of female western pine beetles captured. The greatest disruptive effect for the western pine beetle was 46.7% for (Z)-2-hexen-1-ol on males. These results support the hypothesis that GLVs common to non-host angiosperms are disruptive to pheromone and horomone attraction of conifer-attacking bark beetles. While general GLVs are disruptive to several scolytid species, the most disruptive individual GLV components and blends differ by scolytld species and may reflect differences in the volatile characteristics of their particular ecosystems.

Very few beetles were recaptured more than 500 m from the point of release, although this may have been due to interference by intervening traps. Trapping effectiveness depended on trap location, date of release, wind speed and distance from the point of release. Between 2 and 3% of the released beetles were recaptured in total.

All eggs treated with 100 ppm failed to hatch; a dose dependent response was noticed at lower concentration (LC50= 1.59 ppm, LC95=29.88 ppm). High larval and pupal mortality occurred when fully-grown larvae were exposed to fenoxycarb (LC50=2.33 ppm, LC95=32.67 ppm). Freshly formed pupae were slightly less susceptible (LC50=30.50, LC95=93.00) than eggs or larvae. Abnormal development (both in times required for growth and adult formation) was noted in all treatments.

N2  - Mortality of mountain pine beetle larvae (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) in naturally in rested logs of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Douglas) held at constant low temperatures was investigated. The logs were brought to the laboratory in mid-fall and stored at -6.6°C for 10 weeks, then at -12.2°C for 2 weeks prior to the start of the experiments to allow the larvae to acquire maximum cold hardiness. The logs were exposed to constant temperatures or -1 7.8, -23.3, -28.8, and -34.4°C for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 days. Mortality of larvae was recorded for two size classes: 1st- and 2nd-instar larvae and 3rd- and 4th-instar larvae. Mortality in logs stored at -12.2°C served as control. Mortality was negatively correlated with log diameter, bark thickness, brood density, and gallery length per m2, but only the correlation with log diameter was statistically significant. Mortality in both small and large larvae was inversely related to temperature and directly related to duration of treatment. Mortality of the small larvae was positively correlated to mortality of large larvae but mortality of the latter was significantly lower. Multiple regression was used to describe the relationship between temperature, duration of treatment, and log diameter for both larval groups. Results are discussed in relation to published in formation. Key words: Dendroctonus monticolae; Scolytidae; Pinus contorta; mortality; low temperature; cold hardiness

N2  - Laboratory studies were conducted to characterize some aspects of the sexual biology of Pandemis pyrusana Kearfott. Both males and females were sexually active during their first scotophase. Virgin females held at 22°C started calling the first night 4 - 5 hrs into scotophase. Calling by virgin females occurred earlier and continued longer into scotophase after the first night. Mating lasted 3 - 4 hrs and both sexes mated only once per evening. Calling frequency by mated females was lower than for virgins and dropped off sharply after 2 nights. Forty percent of females mated more than once during the 6-day test. Males mated on consecutive scotophases, but the percentage of subsequent copulations passing a spennatophore declined with age. Oviposition occurred throughout a diurnal cycle, but was concentrated during early scotophase. Females laid an average of four egg masses from which 219 larvae eclosed. Egg mass size, number of larvae emerging, and the number of larvae emerging per egg mass area declined with subsequent egg masses. Key words: Pandemis; leafrollers; apple; sexual behaviour

N2  - This paper provides data on the number of nonviable Cydia pomonella (L.) eggs that are present in orchards receiving sterile moths and the potential for these eggs to support populations of the parasitoid Trichogramma platneri Nagarkatti. In the laboratory, non-irradiated female codling moths laid ca. 214 eggs in their lifetime while females irradiated with 330 Gy laid only 93 eggs. Persistence data collected in the field indicated that the majority of nonviable eggs were no longer suitable for parasitization after 1 week. With a release rate of 1,000 sterile females per hectare per week we estimated that 30,000-40,000 nonviable eggs per hectare would be present in orchards at any given time. When a combination of sterile moths and parasitoids were released into large field-cages fruit damage was less than seen when either tactic was used alone.

N2  - The seasonal occurrcnce of life-history stages of Bucculatrix ainsliella Murtfeldt (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae), and the level or attaek by parasitoids on larvae and pupae, were determined for a population occurring on red oak trees (Quercus rubra L.) in an urban area of Burnaby, BC. B. ainsliella completed two generations in Burnaby in 1997, and a substantial increase in population density occurred between the first and second generations. Pupal parasitism reached high levels (>40% parasitism) during the first generation in this population, but larval parasitism occurred at a very low level. Dispersal of large numbers of second-generation larvae on silken threads, and subsequent pupation on parked vehicles on residential streets, cause much of the pest impact of this "nuisance" inscct. Attack by pupal parasitoids in the first generation probably reduccs the pest impact of these second-generation larvae.

N2  - To test the hypothesis that host selection and mass attack by the fir engraver, Scolytus ventralis LeConte, is mediated in part by pheromones, an exhaustive series of experiments was conducted. Gas chromatographic (GC) analysis and GC-electroantennographic detection analysis was performed on Porapak Q-captured volatiles from virgin and mated beetles of both sexes, logs of grand fir, Abies grandis (Dougl.) Lindl., with males, females or both sexes boring in the bark, and trees undergoing attack in the field, and on extracts of abdominal tips from beetles topically-treated with methoprene, a juvenile hormone analogue, or beetles boring in methoprene-treated bark of grand fir. None of these analyses disclosed any sex-specific compounds or compounds that changed markedly in concentration following treatment. Extracts of the females&#039; terminal abdominal glands with associated vaginal palpi contained exo-brevicomin, a common aggregation pheromone in the genera Dendroctonus and Dryocoetes, but laboratory and field experiments showed it to have no apparent role in long-range orientation. Extensive visual and videotaped observations revealed that females walking on grand fir bark displayed apparent "calling" and "marking" behavior. and during courtship males rubbed the females&#039; abdominal declivity with their frons, placing their antennae in juxtaposition to the females&#039; vaginal palpi. These results arc consistent with the alternative hypothesis that host selection and mass attack by S. ventralis are mediated solely by primary attractants to the host tree, but they do not rule out the possibility of short-range pheromone-mediated behavior.

N2  - Bare soil, grass and weedy ground covers were compared for their influence on population densities of western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera:Thripidae), within a blossoming British Columbian apple orchard. Weedy ground cover harbored the thrips before and during their movement into the apple blossoms and more western flower thrips were found in the trees in weedy ground plots than in bare soil plots during the first week of bloom. These early season differences in thrips counts did not persist through thc season, and were not consistently reflected in the percent of apples damaged by the thrips. The F1 generation of western flower thrips in cluster samples were lower in trees where nymphs of the common green lacewing Chrysopa carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) were introduced at bloom. The introduced lacewings did not reduce thrips damage to the apples. Key words: Frankliniella occidentalis; thrips; apples; ground cover

N2  - An insecticide from neem, Azadirachta indica A. Jussieu, seeds, applied to the xylem of lodgepole pine trees at 0.05 g of the active ingredient, azadirachtin per cm diameter at breast height, reduced larval numbers and almost totally prevented successful development to adulthood of the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, whether applied before or after trees were attacked. Smaller amounts of azadirachtin were less effective. Neem was effective up to the top of the beetle attack zone (4 m), indicating that the active ingredient was effectively translocated. The treatment window for applying neem systemically against this pest is longer in duration than previously thought, and pre-attack treatments can be used to create lethal trap trees.

N2  - Recent research indicates that development of coniferophagous bark beetles can be severely disrupted by systemic applications of extracts from seeds of the neem tree, Azadirachta indica A. Jussieu. However, the potential for neem to repel or deter feeding has not been determined. Surface treatment to the run-off point with a neem based insecticide (2,000 ppm azadirachtin in 10% emulsifiable concentrate in water) to the boles of attractant-baited lodgepole pines, Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelmann, was ineffective at repelling or deterring attack by the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins. Therefore, the activity of neem against the mountain pine beetle is limited to that of a systemically-applied insect growth regulator.

Characteristics of stands and attacked trees varied considerably, and attacked trees did not differ from healthy trees in the same stand in telms of age, height, or diameter. Attacked trees were normally isolated, but along the edges of two small gaps caused by the root disease-causing fungus, Inonotus tomentosus (Fr.:Fr.) S.Teng, we found three and four attacked trees, respectively. All other stands where we found attacks had a high incidence of tomentosus root disease, but we found only two attacked trees which were actually infected by the fungus. The majority of attacked trees displayed basal resinosis, which appeared to be caused by a stain-causing, unidentified pathogen.

N2  - Adult eclosion and oviposition of obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), was studied under field conditions so that integrated pest management of this species could be appropriately timed. Seasonal flight activity of adult males was monitored with synthetic pheromone-baited traps in unsprayed, organically grown apple, Malus domesticus (Borkh.) orchards in the Similkameen (1994-1997) and Okanagan (1996-1997) Valleys of British Columbia. Eclosion of adults from collected larvae and oviposition of female moths was monitored by daily observation in the 1996 and 1997 field seasons to establish relationships between insect phenology and accumulated degree days above 10°C (°ddlO°C) air temperature after 1 January. Males emerged before females throughout the eclosion period in both years. First catches of males in pheromone-baited traps preceded first-male eclosion of collected males by 7 and 6 °ddlO°C in 1996 and 1997, respectively, after which cumulative percentages of trap capture lagged behind cumulative percentages of male eclosion in both years. First and second male flight periods had similar durations in the Similkameen Valley, varying from 481-636 and 476-779 °ddlO°C, respectively. Mean (±SE) initiation of oviposition was 29 ± 2.2 °ddlO°C after the first female eclosed. The nonlinear relationships between plots of cumulative adult emergence, oviposition and trap catch against °dd10°C after I January were modelled using Weibull functions. Fifty percent adult eclosion was predicted to occur at 328 and 335 °dd10°C after 1 January for males and females in the overwintered gcneration, respectively. Fifty percent male and female eclosion in the summer generation was predicted to occur at 843 and 909 °dd10°C after 1 January. Fifty percent oviposition was predicted at 91 °dd10°C after first female emergence. Models of the trap catch in the Similkameen and Okanagan Valleys were similar and predicted 50% of the first flight at 438 (Similkameen) and 485 (Okanagan)°dd10°C after 1 January. Prediction of the occurrence of adult obliquebanded leafroller eclosion, mating and oviposition will aid in the developmcnt of a pheromone-based, integrated pest management programme for C. rosaceana in British Columbia.

N2  - Capture of codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., in lure-baited, wing-style traps placcd at varying distances from polyethylene dispensers (Isomate-C+) in the canopy of an apple orchard was investigated during 1997. Replicated studies of trap - dispenser position were conducted with releases of sterile moths around each trap. In the first experiment, moth catch was unexpectcdly higher in traps placed 1 m below the 1997 dispenser&#039;s height (3.38 m) compared with traps at the dispenser&#039;s height. No differcnces were found in moth catch for traps placed adjacent to or 1 and 2 m distant from dispensers at the dispenser height. Subsequent analysis of the Isomate-C+ dispensers left in the field from 1996 found that they continued to emit low levels of sex pheromone through July. In the second experiment, the 1996 dispensers were removed from the trees around each trap and moth catch was significantly lower in traps placed 1 m below the 1997 dispenser height and in traps adjacent to the dispcnser comparcd with traps 1 and 2 m distant at the dispenser&#039;s height. In a third test, moth catches were significantly reduced when thc trap - dispenser distance was < 0.3 m for both 1996 and 1997 dispensers. Moth catch did not vary in traps placed 0.3 to 2.0 m from either dispenser type. A post-hoc evaluation or trap placements used in an areawide projcct situated near Oroville, Washington, in 1996 found that 9% of traps were placcd within 0.3 m of dispensers. This percentage of traps increased to 30% in 1997 following recommendations that traps should be placed higher in the canopy.

N2  - The effectiveness of exclusion fences in preventing the colonization of carrot plantings by the carrot rust fly, Psila rosae (F.), was tested in small field plots. Fenced enclosures were surrounded by panels of mesh nylon window screen l20cm high. Control enclosures were left unfenced. Although the number of first generation P. rosae adults captured on yellow sticky traps was not significantly different between control and fenced enclosures, the number of second generation adults emerging within enclosures was significantly higher in control enclosures than in fenced enclosures. The percentage of unmarketable carrots, % damaged carrots, % urunarketable yield, % damaged yield, and number of lesions per carrot were all significantly higher in control enclosures than in fenced enclosures. We conclude that exclusion fences impede the colonization of carrot plantings by P. rosae and reduce damage to carrots. The results are discussed as they relate to pest management methods for thc carrot rust fly. Key words: Psila rosae; carrot rust fly; physical control; exclusion fences

N2  - Codling moths, Cydia pomonella (L.), from a mass-reared colony induced into diapause and from locally collected overwintering populations were placed in the field inside mesh cages in the fall of 1997 to determine whether they would synchronize their spring emergence with the wild population and thus could be used as a tool to set biofix. Our results show that the laboratory-reared moths emerged at approximately the same time regardless of the location where they spent the winter. Locally collected (and caged) wild material always emerged later than the remaining wild population and thus was no better at predicting biofix than were laboratory-reared insects.

N2  - An integrated pest management (IPM) program based on monitoring, parasite releases, and economic thresholds was implemented in the hazelnut industry in the early 1980&#039;s. To assess the economic and environmental benefits of the IPM program, growers were surveyed in 1981 to determine insecticide use in 1980, prior to the inception of the program, and in 1998 to quantify insecticide use in 1997, after the program had been adopted throughout the growing region. Survey respondents encompassed 23% and 20% of the hazelnut producing acreage in 1980 and 1997 respectively. Data indicate that the total number of annual spray applications was reduced by about 50%, resulting in an annual industry savings of over a half-million dollars.

Pheromone-baited traps caught significantly more DFB than did trap trees. More male DFB were caught in pheromone-baited traps than in trap trees, while significantly higher numbers of females were caught in the trap trees. Additional benefits of pheromone-baited traps include, easy deployment, less mortality of some beneficial insects, and low cost.

However, some adults of H. euryallis (Boisduval) on southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, were found to lack these white body markings. Controlled rearing indicated that the "brown" phenotype is produced by a recessive allele at a single autosomal locus, and examination of museum specimens showed that it is fairly common on southern Vancouver Island and has been present there for at least half a century.

Aphid accumulations increase with increasing fence height, but are not affected by fence overhang length. Overall aphid levels are higher in small (4.3 m square) enclosed plots than in unenclosed plots. Enclosing large (38 m square) plots does not alter overall aphid catches, but does alter aphid distribution within enclosures. In large enclosures aphid accumulations are higher at enclosure perimeters than interiors, with the highest accumulations near enclosure corners. This concentric distribution is not observed in unfenced areas, and is not altered by the addition of a trap crop outside an enclosure. Key words: Myzus persicae; Delia radicum; physical control

Resulting A. iole larvae developed normally on eggs of both host species and emerged as adults. The wings of A. iole emerging from L. shulli eggs were significantly larger than those from L. elisus probably because the eggs of L. shulli were larger. Anaphes iole females parasitized only approximately 50% of the eggs available of either host species. This may indicate that 50% of the hosts were suitable and rejected, that 50% were unsuitable for oviposition, or that the structure of bean pods prevents females from finding or ovipositing in 50% of hosts. Anaphes iole has potential for biological control of Lygus spp. on greenhouse vegetables in southwestern British Columbia.

N2  - This research examined the eclosion times of blow fly eggs to determine whether eggs begin to develop at the time of oviposition, or in vivo. Eggs were obtained from laboratory colonies of Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy, Phaenicia sericata (Meigen) and Eucalliphora latifrons (Hough) and observed at 2-h intervals. All three species had eggs eclose earlier than the expected minimum of 22 h at 21°C. Precocious egg development occurred for 75% of the C. vicina egg mass, while 100% of the E. latifrons and P. sericata egg masses developed early. Subsequently, we denied an oviposition medium to fresh C. vicina and P. sericata colonies for 7 and 14 d and compared the eclosion times with that of eggs from colonies with a continual access to beef liver. In both species, no precocious egg development was observed as the eggs eclosed 3-4 h after the expected minimum time of eclosion in both treatments and control. Finally, we examined eclosion times of eggs laid by blow flies in the wild. Eggs laid in the wild by P. sericata and C. vicina also took 1-3 h longer to eclose than the expected minimum time of eclosion. Our first experiment demonstrated that eggs laid by a single female at one time, can eclose at a wide variety of times, ranging from 2 h to the expected 22 h after oviposition at 21°C. Our inability to repeat the early eclosion in the laboratory with new colonies, despite the denial of oviposition media, or in the wild under natural conditions, is reassuring to those using egg development and eclosion to determine elapsed time since death. Clearly this phenomenon is not common, and may be explained as an artifact of laboratory colonies that do not have a regular influx of wild blow flies. Key words: forensic entomology; medico-legal entomology; elapsed time since death

N2  - The location, behavior, and sex were recorded for 329 whites potted sawyers, Monochamus scutellatus (Say), on horizontal host logs in a logyard in Ft. Nelson BC. Over 65% of all males and females observed, and 58% of oviposition, occurred on the sides of horizontal host logs. This behavior would minimize the costs of desiccation and slow development of progeny on the upper and lower sections of logs, respectively. The sex ratio was male-biased throughout the season, rising to 4.1 males per female on 5 August 2000. Copulation and oviposition peaked on 9 and 21 July, respectively. By 5 August copulation was no longer observed. A late-season increase in the proportion of mobile males may represent a change in male reproductive strategy from selecting a preferred oviposition site and waiting for female arrival, to active pursuit of increasingly scarce females.

N2  - The cabbage seedpod weevil, Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (Marsham), which has recently become established in southern Alberta, is a serious pest of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) in Europe and the USA and poses a major threat to the economic sustainability of canola production in western Canada. This paper reviews the biology and control of this pest and identifies future research needs. Control strategies in Europe and the USA have so far relied on insecticides because no cultural or biological control methods have been successful. Research on plant resistance is in progress at several research centres and could provide the long term solution. Several parasitoid species are known to suppress populations of the weevil in Europe and are candidates for biocontrol programs in North America. Current research priorities in western Canada are to quantify the effects of weevil densities on canola seed yield, to establish economic thresholds and to design control strategies that integrate chemical, cultural and biological controls. Research programs should be established to screen a wide range of Brassica germplasm to identify sources of resistance for use in developing resistant cultivars for western Canada. Research on the overwintering ecology and seasonal activity of this weevil is needed to model how its range is likely to expand to other canola growing regions of Canada and to enable forecasting of outbreaks. Key words: Brassica, oilseed rape, Ceutorhynchinae, Ceutorhynchus assimilis, Ceutorhynchus obstrictus, canola insect pests

N2  - We report a method of rearing cranberry girdler Chrysoteuchia topiaria (Zeller), a pyralid that is a serious pest of cranberry Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton. Fertile eggs from field-caught females were scattered on reed canary grass Phalaris arundinacea L. planted in greenhouse flats (50 eggs/flat) kept under fluorescent lights at 16L:8D and temperatures of 22-30°C (day): 19-24°C (night). Under these conditions, survival from egg to adult was 28%. Progeny of these adults entered diapause after exposure to low light (ca. 0.5 lux) as larvae. Diapause was broken by placing insects in the dark at 4.5-5.5°C for ca. 3 months, but survival was very poor (8% from egg to adult).

N2  - The population dynamics of Pandemis pyrusana (Kearfott) were studied in 60 contiguous orchard blocks (154 hectares) of mixed fruit production situated in the Yakima Valley, Washington. Grids of sex-pheromone-baited and liquid-food-baited traps were placed at a rate of one trap of each type per 2 hectares. Trees within 50 m of each trapping location were sampled for overwintering and summer generation larvae, and fruit injury prior to harvest. Larvae from both generations were found in a low proportion of apple (Malus domestica Borkh.), pear ( Pyrus communis L.), and cherry ( Prunus avium L.) orchards, but not in the peach/nectarine ( Prunus persica (L.)), apricot ( Prunus armeniaca L,), or prune ( Prunus domestica L.) orchards. Larval densities between generations increased 5-fold in apple and 10-fold in cherry and non-bearing apple. Parasitism of field-collected larvae by tachinid parasitoids averaged 37% and 23% for each generation, respectively. Low levels of fruit injury (<0.5%) by P. pyrusana were detected in only five apple and pear orchards. Cumulative moth catch was 10-fold higher in sex-pheromone than food-baited traps. Moth catch in both types of traps varied significantly among crops, In general, moth catches were highest in apple and cherry. Cumulative moth catch in both trap types in apple and pear during the first flight was weakly correlated with levels of fruit injury. In contrast, moth catch during the second flight was not correlated with fruit injury. The observed low predictive ability of traps was likely due to trap saturation and contamination with non-target moths and a general dispersal of moths among orchards throughout the region. The capture of female moths versus the total of both sexes caught in food bait traps did not improve the prediction of fruit injury in apple or pear.

N2  - Japanese-beetle traps were used to monitor flight of the Pacific coast wireworm, Limonius canus LeConte, in an agricultural field in northern Oregon. Overwintered beetles first appeared in traps in mid-March 2000 and 2001, and were collected until mid- to late-May both years. Most (93%) of the females collected at the beginning of the flight period had been in seminated, which may indicate that mating takes place very soon after beetles emerge from the soil. Sex ratios favored males at the beginning of the flight period and favored females at the end of the flight period. Lower temperatures in April 2001 compared to those in 2000 may have caused a delay in timing of the peak catch (relative to timing in 2000) by almost 3 weeks. A count of over eight beetles per trap per 7-day sampling interval was obtained during the week of peak catch in April 2000. Traps were hung at three heights: 1.5, 0.9, and 0.3 m above ground. Catch decreased with increasing trap height. Traps that had been painted yellow collected more beetles than traps painted white, which in turn collected more beetles than traps painted red, green, dark blue, or black. Two other elaterids, Ctenicera pruinina (Horn) and Cardiophorus montanus Bland, were also trapped during the study. Key words: Limonius canus; click beetles; monitoring; flight; trap

N2  - A two-choice feeding bioassay was used to investigate the effects of dilution, centrifugation, storage and autoclaving on the repellency of the oral exudate of eastern and western spruce budworms, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.) and C. occidentalis Free., to their respective conspecifics. The exudate from insects reared on either artificial diet or foliage was active at a volume equal to the amount emitted by one larva when disturbed with a pipet in the laboratory, but repellency was lost at lower doses. Centrifugation did not partition the exudate into active and inactive fractions. Exudate from both diet- and foliage-reared insects was active for at least 48 h at room temperature. However, after being frozen for one month, exudate from diet-reared insects was still active, while that from foliage-reared insects was not.

Addition of 84%-(-)-verbenone at a high release rate to the three-component aggregation pheromone of I. perturbatus (racemic ipsenol, racemic ipsdienol, and 83%-(-)-cis-verbenol), significantly reduced trap catches. The results of this study, combined with previous results on the presence of verbenone in extracts of volatiles collected from feeding I. perturbatus and GC-EAD data, are consistent with antiaggregant behavioral activity of verbenone for I. perturbatus.

Both A. obscurus and A. lineatus were taken in pheromone traps from each of 77 fields monitored throughout the lower Fraser Valley during 2000 and 2001, expanding the known ranges of both species. No specimens of either species were taken in pheromone traps set at 56 sites distributed throughout the Okanagan, Similkameen and Nichola Valleys in 2000, but one specimen of A. lineatus was found in a private collection that had been captured near Merritt BC. This is the first record of A. lineatus in BC outside of the lower Fraser Valley. Of nine counties surveyed in Washington State in 2000, A. obscurus was taken in traps at several sites in Whatcom county, especially along the Canada/US border, and A. lineatus was taken at several sites in Whatcom, Snohomish and Pierce counties.

N2  - Biogeographic analysis suggests that 241 Cicadellidae, 33 Delphacidae and I Caliscelid are restricted to grasslands in the Pacific Northwest. Nearly half of these (120 or 44%) are endemics. This grassland endemic fauna is third only to those of the prairies and desert grasslands. Of these, only six taxa probably postdate retreat of continental glaciers. The present distribution of the older taxa indicates that this fauna are descended from nine main glacial-era refugia (in descending order of importance): (1) east slopes of the Cascade Range, from Washington state to southern Oregon; (2) Columbia basin including Palouse hills of Washington and canyons of western Idaho; (3) south-facing slopes on the Rocky Mountains of Montana and western Wyoming; (4) the headwaters of the Snake River and south-facing slopes north of the Snake River in southern Idaho; (5) east of the Coast Range of Oregon; (6) edges of glacial Lake Missoula in western Montana; (7) a periglacial grassland near the ice front in Alberta; (8) the mountains of south-central Oregon; and (9) the coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands. Additional refugia might have been in the mountains of Colorado, Utah, eastern Arizona, and eastern Wyoming, where there are an additional 22 endemics, Postglacial warming brought grasslands and their endemic insects to British Columbia on the islands of the Strait of Georgia, to the East Kootenay valley and to the upper Fraser River of BC. Faunal exchanges have occurred across at least nine mountain passes on the continental divide. Three of these passes still provide continuous grassland connections between the prairies and the intermontane grasslands, yet not more than 14 slow-moving prairie species have surmounted any one pass.

N2  - The species of Scolytidae in Alaska have not been compiled in recent times although many of them are included in earlier broader works. The authors of these works are summarized in a brief history of forest entomologists in Alaska. Fifty-four species of Alaskan Scolytidae are listed (23 species in the subfamily Hylesininae and 31 in the subfamily Scolytinae) belonging to 24 genera (11 in Hylesininae and 13 in Scolytinae). They infest 15 species of trees and shrubs of which 10 are conifers (host to 48 species of Scolytidae) and 5 are angiosperms (host to 6 species of Scolytidae). Fifty species are bark beetles that inhabit phloem and four species are ambrosia beetles that live in sapwood. All are species native to Alaska.

N2  - Walking speeds of both Trichogramma brassicae and T. sibericum were substantially lower on tomato than on pepper leaf disks. The difference may be due to the presence of glandular trichomes on tomato foliage. Total time spent on leaf disks during behavioural trials was lower on tomato than on pepper leaf disks for both species of wasps. This may indicate a higher propensity to disperse from tomato foliage than from pepper foliage. Lower walking speeds and shorter residence times on tomato leaves could result in a lower searching efficiency of wasps on tomato than on pepper. The subsequent efficacy of Trichogramma for biological control of cabbage loopers in greenhouses may be lower on tomato crops than on pepper crops.

N2  - Delta, diamond, and wing style sticky traps baited with codlemone were evaluated in both flight tunnel and in field trials to detennine their perfonnance in capturing male codling moth Cydia pomonella (L.). Flight tunnel studies found no differences among trap types in tenns of moth orientation behaviors. However, the proportion of moths contacting each trap type that were caught varied significantly. The ICP wing trap caught a lower proportion of moths than the IIB diamond trap due to a significantly lower efficiency in retaining moths that landed on the trap. The position of a moth&#039;s first contact varied among traps with a significantly higher proportion landing on the outside of the wing style versus the delta and diamond traps. A significantly lower proportion of moths first landing on the outside of the delta trap were caught than for moths landing on the outside of the ICP wing trap. A significantly lower proportion of moths landing on the front opening of the ICP wing trap were captured than for the other traps. No differences were found among trap types for either the proportion of moths flying into traps or the proportion of these moths captured. A majority of moths orienting to the diamond and delta traps first landed on the front flap and walked into the trap. The removal of the front flap from these traps did not affect their efficiency. However, a significantly greater proportion of moths flew directly into the delta trap when the flap was removed. Lure position within a delta trap did not affect moth catch, but it did affect the position of a moth&#039;s first contact with the trap. Lures placed high in the trap elicited moth landing on thc inside surface of the trap&#039;s side or on the outside of the trap. Moths tended to land on the front flap when lures were placed in the adhesive. The relative field perfonnance of traps in a sex pheromone-treated apple orchard was consistent with the flight tunnel studies, however, it was also influenced by moth population density. The ICP trap caught significantly fewer moths than the other traps in an orchard with low codling moth density. The mean cumulative moth catch of each trap type was proportional to its adhesive-treated surface area within orchards receiving releases of sterile moths.

N2  - Xylotrechus longitarsis Casey is a common wood-boring beetle that causes considerable losses to the softwood lumber industry in British Columbia. Trapping experiments were conducted in the southem interior of British Columbia to determine whether the generic bait of α-pinene plus ethanol is an optimal combination for attraction of X. longitarsis. α-pinene alone attracted substantial numbers of X. longitarsis and trap catches were increased significantly with the addition of ethanol lures but different release rates of ethanol had no significant effect. The blend of pure α-pinene and ethanol was significantly more attractive than more complete blends of conifer monoterpenes and ethanol, whether or not α-pinene was a major component of the blend. Strong attraction to α-pinene reflects the preference of X. longitarsis for conifers, and particularly Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco, the bark of which is relatively rich in α-pinene. Increased attraction with the addition of ethanol lures, irrespective of release rates, to traps baited with α-pinene suggests that X. longitarsis prefers severely stressed hosts or deteriorating host material but may also utilize freshly cut or broken material.

N2  - The emission rate, isomeric stability, and relative attractiveness of field-aged gray halo-butyl elastomer and red rubber septa loaded with 4.0 and 10.0 mg of (E,E)-8, I O-dodecadien-l-ol (E8,E10-12:0H, codlemone), the major sex pheromone component for codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., were evaluated. Initially, field-aged red septa loaded with 10.0 mg had significantly higher emission rates than gray septa loaded with 4.0 mg codlemone. Emission rates of codlemone decayed over time from both lures and were similar for lures aged 28-42 d in the field. Isomerization of E8,E10-12:0H occurred rapidly in red septa but did not occur in the gray septa. Moth capture in traps baited with either lure type aged in the field did not differ initially (0 and 7 d), but were significantly lower in traps baited with 14, 28, and 42 d-old red versus gray septa. Significant differences observed in the attractiveness of these two types of field-aged lures were primarily due to changes in their isomeric purity and not to differences in their emission rate. Increasing the codlemone load of gray septa up to 20.0 mg did not improve the performance of lures in sex pheromone-treated orchards. All lures were effective for 10 wk. Loading gray septa with 50.0 mg codlemone increased lure attractiveness and extended its longevity to 16 wk. Proprietary gray septa loaded with a high rate of pheromone and replaced once per season were more attractive than the standard 10.0 mg loaded red septa replaced three times in a sex pheromone-treated orchard.

N2  - In Volume 98, pp. 107-108, the historical account relating to the work of Neil Gilbert and collaborators was not correct. Neil wrote the following response: &#039;After cabbage aphid and Masonaphis, I thought it might be possible to introduce some limited generalization into population dynamics by constructing a Universal Aphid of which every aphid species would be a particular case. But pea aphid put paid to that. In the first two species, predation could be represented by a simple formula because it only took surplus production of aphids and was more or less compensated by density-dependent reproduction. In pea aphid, the coccinellids drove aphid numbers down low, so we either had to study predation in detail or admit defeat. It was all very messy but proved possible to predict predation rates, but not the numbers of beetles entering the field. That would be possible only if you knew the dynamics of the whole local ecosystem, an impossible task. In other words, the aphid population couid not be isolated from the rest, even to a first approximation. The whole thing was a failure as far as I was concerned, although a very instructive one.&#039;

N2  - In the western Nearctic and the Palaearctic Regions several species of Odonata occur, without evident gaps in distribution, from latitude 50° N northwards to the Arctic Circle (66°30&#039;N) and beyond. The decline in incident solar radiation along this latitude gradient does not appear to be reflected, as might be expected, in progressively later emergence, despite the progress of metamorphosis being dependent on ambient temperature. On the contrary, reports indicate that, in some species, northernmost populations may emerge at least as early as, and sometimes even earlier than, more southerly populations, suggesting that some mechanism exists that enables larval developmental rate to compensate for latitude. Reported responses by late-stadium larvae to photoperiod, placed in the context of seasonal changes of photoperiod at different latitudes, make it plausible to postulate the existence of a single, fixed response to photoperiod that would continuously adjust developmental rate to latitude, at least between 50° and 70° N. In Odonata such a response, to be effective, would be confined to species possessing a Type-2 or Type-3 life cycle, in which more than one stadium precedes metamorphosis in spring or early summer. The hypothesis proposed here does not invoke genetic heterogeneity of response in populations at different latitudes, such as has been detected in certain other insects. The response predicted by the hypothesis may complement, rather than substitute for, other mechanisms of seasonal regulation. Steps are described by which the hypothesis could be tested in Odonata. *Text based on an invited, oral contribution to the Workshop "North American Dragonflies", included in the Joint Meeting of the Entomological Society of Canada and the Entomological Society of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, 9 October 2002.

N2  - The European pine shoot moth, Rhyacionia buoliana (Denis and Schiffermueller), is an exotic shoot-boring insect of hard pines in British Columbia. In 1999 infestations of this pest in native lodgepole pine were reported at a seed orchard in the interior of this province where large numbers of the shoot moth reduced seed production by damaging pollen and cone bearing shoots. Rhyacionia buoliana were recorded on about 80% of the trees in a lodgepole pine seed orchard in June 2000. Pheromone trap catches and weather observations over three years indicated that first, and peak R. buoliana flight occurred when approximately 1000, and 1680 degree-days, respectively had accumulated from January to August (using a threshold of -2.2°C). We found no evidence of a serious threat to natural lodgepole pine stands from R. buoliana damage. Head capsule measurements confirmed the presence of six larval instars in R. buoliana in BC.

N2  - Two pre-harvest baiting regimes were tested for their effect on Dryocoetes confusus in select stands at the Sicamous Creek Silviculture Systems Project. Single tree and two tree bait treatments, in addition to a control area, were established in a grid format throughout the research area. There were significantly more new D. confusus attacks in the baited areas than in the control area. Eighty percent of mass attacks occurred within 9 m of single tree bait centres, while 75% of mass attacks occurred within 10 m of twotree bait centres. Baiting appears to concentrate attacks into a discrete area and therefore could be used in single tree selection or patch cut systems (cuts generally less than 5 ha in size), two of the silviculture systems applied at the Sicamous Creek research area. Of 136 dead subalpine fir trees felled and examined, 105 (77%) showed clear evidence of D. confusus attack, making it the major cause of sub-alpine fir mortality at the Sicamous Creek research site. Naturally attacked trees had more advanced brood development and beetles utilized a greater percent of the total tree bole but had lower attack density (number of D. confusus galleries per unit area) than was observed on baited trees. In baited trees, the higher attack density resulted in indistinct gallery systems due to space competition of the brood. This suggested that there was a limited acceptable area for attack in these trees, which would not normally be susceptible. This study concludes it is possible to reduce resident populations of D. confusus by varying the number and placement of bait trees as a pre-harvest treatment.

N2  - Lygus spp. were collected from near and inside vegetable greenhouses during three years in the lower Fraser Valley, British Columbia (BC) and in Leamington, Ontario (ON). In BC, the dominant species was Lygus shulli , followed in abundance by L. elisus and L. hesperus ; L. lineolaris was not collected in the lower Fraser Valley. In ON, only L. lineolaris was collected. In BC, L. shulli was generally distributed throughout the region, whereas L. hesperus was captured in sweep net samples only in coastal areas. Lygus hesperus appeared to be univoltine in BC. All other species in ON and BC were apparently bivoltine. In ON, numbers of adults collected outside of greenhouses correlated with numbers collected inside greenhouses whereas this was not the case in BC. Differences in flight behaviour, abundance and greenhouse construction may account for this latter difference. Our results highlight the need for different approaches to IPM of pest Lygus species in the ON and BC greenhouse industries.

N2  - Our objectives were to document the abundance of lygus bugs (Miridae) in canola after the cutting of adjacent alfalfa hay fields and to document their seasonal activity in canola plots grown in close proximity to alfalfa seed. Cutting alfalfa did not increase abundance of lygus bugs in nearby canola in sites near Barrhead, Alberta (1998-1999), in the Peace River area of British Columbia (2000) or near Carman, Manitoba (2001). In Saskatoon, from 1993-1995, lygus bug numbers remained at low levels in seed alfalfa and canola and there was no indication that the pest species ( L. lineolaris ) in canola moved in significant numbers from the adjacent alfalfa seed field. We conclude that alfalfa forage harvesting generally does not result in massive movement of lygus bugs to nearby canola.

N2  - Studies were conducted to evaluate the influence of trap colour on the captures of honeybees, Apis mellifera L., codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., and non target muscoid flies in sticky delta traps. Traps varied widely in their spectral reflectance. The unpainted white and the painted white and cream traps had the highest reflectance. The painted green trap had the lowest total reflectance. The green, orange, and red traps had low reflectance at wavelengths < 560 nm. Red and green painted traps consistently caught the fewest honeybees, while the unpainted white trap caught the most. Red painted traps caught the greatest number of flies. Significantly more codling moths were caught in green and orange versus the unpainted white traps. In a later experiment, painted green traps caught more codling moths than unpainted white traps.

N2  - Laboratory and field tests were conducted to evaluate the use of an experimental sprayable formulation of chopped hollow fibres loaded with codlemone and mixed with 1.0% esfenvalerate and an adhesive to control codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). Moths were not repelled by the addition of the insecticide to the adhesive and were rapidly killed following brief contact. A significantly greater proportion of male moths flew upwind and contacted individual fibres for a longer period of time when fibres had been aged > 7 d versus fibres 0 – 7 days-old in flight tunnel tests. Field tests using sentinel fibres placed in 10.0 mg drops of adhesive on plastic disks stapled to the tree found that fibres were not touched until they had aged > 8 d. Conversely, moth mortality following a 3-s exposure to field-collected fibres deposited on the top of leaves was low in bioassays with fibres aged > 8 d. The deposition and adhesion of fibres within the apple canopy appear to be two major factors influencing the success of this approach. Fibres were found adhering to foliage, fruit, and bark within the orchard; however, visual recovery of fibres following each of the three applications was < 5.0%. Both the substrate and the positioning of the fibre on the substrate influenced fibre retention. The highest proportion of fibres was found initially on the upper surface of leaves and this position also had the highest level of fibre retention. Fibres on the underside of leaves or partially hanging off of a substrate were dislodged within two weeks.

N2  - Densities and types of arthropods overwintering on common mullein, Verbascum thapsus L., in a fruit-growing region of Central Washington were determined. Over 45,000 arthropods were collected from 55 plants (5 plants from each of 11 sites), dominated numerically by Acari and Thysanoptera. Insects representing 8 orders and 29 families were identified, distributed both in the basal leaf rosettes and in the stalk material of the plants. One specialist insect herbivore of mullein, the mullein thrips, Haplothrips verbasci (Osborn), was abundant at all sites. Several pest and predatory taxa that commonly occur in orchards were also collected, suggesting that mullein may be a source of overwintered pests or predators moving into orchards in early spring. Pest taxa included primarily western flower thrips ( Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande)), Lygus spp., and tetranychid spider mites. Common predators included phytoseiid mites and minute pirate bugs ( Orius tristicolor (White)). Sites that were geographically close to one another were not more similar (in taxonomic composition of overwintering arthropods) than more distantly separated sites.

N2  - Simultaneous disruption of pheromone communication and mating of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L), and four leafroller (Lepidoptera:Tortricidae) species, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), Pandemis limitata (Robinson), Archips rosanus (L.) and Archips argyrospilus (Walker ) using an incomplete mixture of their individual pheromone components was studied in organic apple orchards, in Cawston, BC, 1997. Multi-species disruption with a single 500 &#039;rope&#039; dispenser / ha application of Isomate-CM/LR was compared to a single 500 dispenser / ha application of Isomate-C. Season-long disruption was assessed using synthetic pheromone traps and laboratory-reared females in mating tables. Mean seasonal recaptures of sterile male C. pomonella , using 10 mg codlemone lures in orchards receiving releases of 1000 males / ha / week, were not significantly different in half-orchard plots (0.5 - 1 ha) of Isomate-CM/LR or Isomate-C. Mating of C. pomonella in Isomate-C- and Isomate-CM/LR-treated plots was negligible. Isomate-CM/LR significantly reduced catches of C. rosaceana and P. limitata relative to catches in Isomate-C-treated plots. Few A. rosanus and no A. argyrospilus were caught in any orchard. Mating of C. rosaceana and P. limitata in Isomate-CM/LR treated plots was significantly less than in Isomate-C-treated plots. Our results indicate Isomate-CM/LR will disrupt mating of C. pomonella equivalent to Isomate-C and may provide sufficient disruption of leafrollers to supplement biological control in organic orchards. Further studies are needed to show impacts of mating disruption on leafroller populations and damage when applied to larger areas and for several seasons sequentially.

N2  - We recorded daily appearance of overwintered larvae of eye-spotted bud moth (ESBM), Spilonota ocellana (Denis & Schiffermüller) in spring 1992, 1994, and 1996 in an unsprayed apple orchard at Summerland, British Columbia, to relate larval emergence to degree-day (DD) accumulation and apple phenology. In all years the first larva was found between mid-March and early April, and none appeared after late April. Median emergence of larvae occurred when McIntosh apple trees were at early, tight-cluster stage of fruit-bud development. Larval head capsule measurements showed that ESBM usually overwinter as fifth and sixth instars, with a small proportion (≤6%) as fourth instar larvae. In the laboratory we monitored emergence of non-diapausing overwintered larvae from apple branches incubated at 8.8, 9.4, 12.9, 15.0, 18.0, and 20.9ºC. A least-squares linear regression described emergence over this temperature range relatively accurately (r2 = 0.57, P < 0.05) and a base temperature for emergence (Tb = 1.0ºC ± 0.6) was extrapolated from this regression. Regression analysis indicated median emergence should require 154.6 ± 6.7 DD above 1ºC (DD 1ºC). Using daily airtemperature maxima and minima and 1 March to start accumulating DD1ºC, the error between predicted and observed days to median emergence in the field was -6.7 ± 3.1 d; the regression model predicted early in every case. Using observed larval appearance on apples (1992, 1994, & 1996) and an iterative process, we determined that a combination of 6ºC as the Tb and 1 January as a date to start accumulating DD6ºC, minimized the coefficient of variation for the three-year mean DD 6ºC accumulations (82.7 ± 3.5 DD 6ºC) required for 50% of the larvae to appear in the field. While this latter DD index described observed emergence of larvae accurately, and its use may help improve management of ESBM, it should be validated using independent data before growers use it routinely.

N2  - In 1992, the Okanagan-Kootenay Sterile Insect Release (SIR) Programme was initiated to eradicate codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), from montane, fruit-growing valleys in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Excessive damage in 1994, and failures to maintain sterile:wild (S:W) over- flooding moth ratios at 40:1, a target deemed necessary for eradication, led to concern about activity of sterile moths and recommendations to supplement control in spring. Using pheromone-baited wing traps and passive sticky pane traps we monitored operational S:W ratios to determine if they continued to fall below 40:1 post-1994. Seasonal flight activity and recapture of sterile moths was compared with that of wild moths from 7 May - 1 September, 1995 - 1999, in nine commercial orchards in Cawston, BC. Mean weekly catches of wild males in pheromone traps, reflected first- (May) and second-generation (August) peaks of flight activity in orchards supplemented with pheromone disruption, but only a single period of activity in insecticide supplemented orchards. Weekly catches of sterile moths in these same orchards were always at their lowest in spring, and activity was correlated with seasonal air temperatures. Yearly average S:W ratios in the insecticide-treated orchards ranged from 24:1 - 203:1 in 1995 - 1997. Examining S:W ratios using data from those weeks when wild moths were actually caught, indicates ratios were frequently (29 - 91%) less than 40:1 in spring but S:W ratios fell below 40:1 less often during summer than spring. Passive pane traps also revealed patterns of fewer sterile moth catches, and lower S:W ratios in spring, compared with summer. Our data suggest low overflooding ratios contributed to slower than predicted population reductions, and increased release of sterile moths, of improved quality, between 1995 and 1997 did not significantly increase mean weekly catches or S:W ratios in individual orchards in spring. Therefore, continued application of supplemental insecticides, or a pheromone disruption treatment that reduced catch of moths, but did not significantly affect S:W ratios in spring, is recommended. We conclude that similar analysis of trap data for the entire SIR Programme (1994 - 2004) and correlations with damage would provide recommendations for the best use of sterile insects as part of any future area-wide codling moth management programme.

N2  - The propyl and ethyl esters of (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoic acid were evaluated in gray halobutyl septa as kairomone lures for both sexes of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.). All studies were conducted in &#039;Bartlett&#039; pear orchards with moderate to high codling moth adult population densities and treated with sex pheromone dispensers for mating disruption. Variable results were obtained with kairomone loading experiments. Increasing the lure loading to 40.0 mg of either the ethyl or propyl ester significantly increased male and total moth catch in separate experiments. However, in other tests with the ethyl ester no difference was found in total moth catch in traps baited with 0.1, 1.0, 3.0 or 10.0 mg versus 40.0 mg lures. The 40.0 mg ethyl and propyl ester lures were both more effective than a 3.0 mg ethyl ester lure and comparable to a sex pheromone lure in detecting the beginning of codling moth flight in the spring generation. No difference was found in moth catch between 40.0 mg propyl and ethyl ester lures. Significantly more females were caught in traps baited with 1.0 – 10.0 mg than with 1.0 – 100.0 μg lures loaded with the ethyl ester. In general, kairomone lures caught significantly fewer moths than sex pheromone lures.

N2  - The effect of the pear volatile, ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate (Et-E,Z-DD), on oviposition by codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), was evaluated in a series of choice and nochoice laboratory experiments and in subsequent field tests conducted in apple and walnut. Gray halobutyl elastomer septa loaded with 1.0 and 100.0 μg Et-E,Z-DD significantly increased the numbers of eggs laid by a laboratory population in 96 h no-choice assays by 2-fold. In addition, the number of eggs laid near the Et-E,Z-DD versus a solvent blank dispenser was significantly higher in choice bioassays across a similar range of septa loadings. Oviposition rates by a field-collected post-diapause strain of codling moth were significantly increased by the addition of a 1.0-μg septa versus a solvent blank dispenser in a no-choice bioassay. Field trials were conducted in apple and walnut to develop an artificial egg trap baited with Et-E,Z-DD to monitor codling moth oviposition. Septa loaded with 0.1 to 10.0 mg did not significantly increase oviposition versus solvent blank dispensers on a Mylar plastic collar trap or on the adjacent leaves and fruit in apple. Significantly more eggs were laid on the fruit and foliage than on the plastic collar. No eggs were deposited on non-bearing apple shoots baited with 0.1 – 40.0 mg Et-E,Z-DD septa. Similarly, no eggs were deposited on cylindrical wax paper-covered plastic traps baited with 10.0 μg to 1.0 mg Et-E,Z-DD septa in walnut orchards. The potential of Et-E,Z-DD to monitor codling moth’s oviposition in the field, stimulate oviposition by field-collected strains under laboratory conditions, and to improve pest control by disrupting host location are discussed.

N2  - Ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate (pear ester) is a kairomonal attractant for both male and female codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), in apple, pear and walnut. Studies were conducted in the western Untied States to evaluate the potential attractiveness of this kairomone for eight lepidopteran pests of these three crops, as well as, in cherry, peach/nectarine, apricot, plum, almond, pistachio, grape, kiwi, and citrus. The pear ester was loaded (10.0 mg) into gray halobutyl septa and insects were monitored with diamond- or delta-shaped sticky traps. Lures were not attractive to peach twig borer, Anarsia lineatella (Zeller); oriental fruit moth, Cydia molesta (Busck); omnivorous leafroller, Platynota stultana Walshingham; navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella (Walker); apple fruitworm, Lacanobia subjuncta (Grote & Robinson); pandemis leafroller, Pandemis pyrusana (Kearfott); obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris); and western tentiform leafminer, Phyllonorycter mespiella (Hüebner). Additional studies with C. molesta populations attacking apple and pear would be useful.

N2  - Field trials run from 2001 to 2003 evaluated the effectiveness of a combination of handapplied sex pheromone dispensers (Isomate-C) applied on the perimeter of apple orchards with an internal grid of either pressurized aerosol emitters (puffers) or clusters of dispensers for control of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.). Puffers were placed in a grid at 1 per ha, while the dispenser clusters were applied at 4 - 8 per ha. Puffers were programmed to release either 240 or 360 mg (E, E)-8-10-dodecadienol (codlemone) per day in 48 puffs (every 15 min from 1500 – 0300 h). Dispensers were grouped in clusters of 50 (Isomate-C TT) or 100 (Isomate-C PLUS) releasing 56 and 33 mg codlemone per d, respectively. No significant differences were found in levels of fruit injury in puffertreated orchards paired with similar orchards treated with 500 Isomate-C PLUS individually applied dispensers per ha. Similarly no significant differences in fruit injury were found in orchards treated with individually applied dispensers versus orchards treated with Isomate-C PLUS dispensers (100 per cluster) placed in screened cages or Isomate-C TT dispensers (50 per cluster) hung from plastic disks. Levels of fruit injury, however, were significantly higher in orchards treated with Isomate-C PLUS dispensers (100 per cluster) hung from plastic disks versus in orchards treated with individually applied dispensers. This later poor performance of the Isomate-C PLUS clusters was associated with its more restricted spacing of dispensers within the cluster and a significant reduction in the weight loss of dispensers compared with dispensers applied individually. These studies suggest that the use of puffers can effectively lower the cost of codling moth management through reductions in sex pheromone puff volume and emitter density.

N2  - Experiments were conducted to evaluate the deposition pattern and effectiveness in disrupting male orientation to virgin female-baited traps of a microencapsulated sex pheromone formulation for codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) in apple, Malus domestica Bordhausen. The efficacy of two application techniques was evaluated in field trials with the microencapsulated formulation Checkmate® CM-F: a high volume (926 liters per ha) application with an air blast sprayer and a low volume (46 liters per ha) application with a custom-built vertical boom sprayer. These treatments were compared to an unsprayed control and a control treatment where the formulation was applied directly on the ground within the plots. Disruption of virgin female-baited traps was significantly greater in the low volume versus the air blast application and versus the two types of control plots. Levels of disruption in the air blast-sprayed plots were not different from untreated plots or in plots where the sprayable sex pheromone was applied directly on the ground. A significant increase in the proportion of traps catching moths occurred in week 4. A significant interaction occurred among the effects of spray method, tree canopy position, and leaf surface on microcapsule deposition. This interaction was likely due to the low rate of deposition of microcapsules on the undersides of leaves in the lower canopy with the low volume sprayer. The low volume sprayer deposited significantly more microcapsules in the upper canopy than the air blast sprayer. Significantly more microcapsules were deposited on the underside versus the top of leaves in the upper canopy with the air blast but not with the low volume sprayer.

N2  - Codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), larval bioassays were carried out on apples and leaves collected from trees treated with the commercially available codling moth granulovirus, Virosoft CP4®, to estimate the persistence of the product over time. The virus had a significant effect on survival of laboratory derived codling moth larvae placed on apples collected up to five and eight days post-treatment. Larvae died with virus symptoms after feeding on treated foliage and the leaf bioassay was easier to count than the apple bioassay. A combination assay, exposing larvae to leaf discs and fruit may more accurately account for potential exposure of wild neonate codling moth to virus in treated orchards. The addition of fish, soybean or mineral oils to Virosoft CP4® treatments did not significantly increase the efficacy or persistence of the viral insecticide on apples in this study.

Similar data for a major pear pest, pear psylla, Cacopsylla pyricola (Förster), were also collected for these same shelters. Pear psylla and H. ovalis emerged earliest, both taxa completing emergence by early March (120 degree-days accumulated from early January). Deraeocoris brevis emerged beginning in late February and finished emergence by early April (150 degree-days for 90% emergence). Chrysopa nigricornis emerged considerably later than the other species, and completed emergence by late May or early June. Calendar-date emergence is also shown for spiders (Araneae) and Anthocoridae (Heteroptera), which occurred at lower numbers in the shelters. The anthocorids, Orius tristicolor White and three species of Anthocoris , emerged from shelters in February and March, while spiders emerged over a long interval between March and May.

N2  - The relationship of Douglas-fir beetle, Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins, brood adult lipid levels and position of development along infested tree boles was investigated. In addition, the effects of phloem and bark thickness on brood adult lipid levels were also tested. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in brood adult lipid levels in relation to bole position, phloem thickness, or bark thickness found in this study. Numbers of attacks, larval mines, brood adults, and parasitoid cocoons did not differ significantly by tree bole position. Results from this study suggest Douglas-fir beetle does not benefit, in the form of increased lipid levels, from oviposition at different bole positions.

N2  - When released from attractant-baited multiple-funnel traps, 3-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1- one (MCH) reduced catches of male and female mountain pine beetles, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, by 67.4% and 71.8%, respectively. 2-Phenyl ethanol reduced the respective catches by 96.6% and 95.1%, but only verbenone and all three compounds together reduced catches to levels no different from those in unbaited control traps. In another experiment, all three binary combinations of the above compounds, plus the ternary combination, reduced catches of both sexes by >96%. In comparable tree protection experiments near Princeton BC, MCH and 2-phenyl ethanol alone and together significantly reduced the percentages of pheromone-baited lodgepole pines that were attacked by 16.0%, 33.3% and 40.0%, respectively, but verbenone alone totally protected baited trees, and many trees within 5 m of them, from attack. In identical experiments near Prince George BC, where mountain pine beetle populations were much higher, adding MCH, 2-phenyl ethanol or both together to verbenone did not cause attack to be reduced significantly beyond that achieved by verbenone alone. Our results confirm that 2-phenyl ethanol is an antiaggregation pheromone for the mountain pine beetle, and that MCH is an interspecific synomone. However, because neither was as effective as verbenone in protecting pheromone-baited trees from attack, and adding either or both to verbenone did not improve protection, neither compound warrants further consideration as a potential tool for operational disruption of attack.

N2  - Five species of the damselfly genus Lestes live in British Columbia, Canada, and of these, Lestes forcipatus Rambur and L. disjunctus Selys are the most similar and most difficult to separate morphologically. Females can be readily distinguished by the size of the ovipositor, but males are difficult to separate. In British Columbia, L. disjunctus is the more common, widespread and familiar species. Before 1998, L. forcipatus specimens were mistaken for those of L. disjunctus because the former is primarily an eastern North American species and because most Lestes species are usually identified using male characters. With the discovery that L. forcipatus is part of the western fauna, an evaluation of the relative status of the two species in British Columbia is necessary. The best method for separating the two species uses the length of the anterior lamina (part of the secondary genitalia) as a unique character or as part of ratios using other measurements. In addition, in at least western North America, L. forcipatus males are more pruinescent than those of L. disjunctus , especially on the thorax. Identification using the pruinescence pattern was tested in the field and is recommended as a simple and accurate method for western North America. Soaking Odonata specimens in acetone, a common technique used to preserve colours, damages surface pruinescence and should not be used to preserve mature, pruinescent adults, including those of Lestes species. To identify L. disjunctus and L. forcipatus males treated in acetone, it may be necessary to calculate ratios based on various character measurements. Future research should investigate spatial and temporal differences between the species, as well as modes of interspecific communication.

N2  - Previous observations lead us to believe that female Pandemis limitata (Robinson) (0 to 24 h old) are as attractive as their pheromone gland extract to males in clean air, but are more attractive in an environment permeated with their major pheromone component(Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate. Therefore, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that females can detect and/or respond to their pheromone components. Using electroantennographic detection, we found female P. limitata able to perceive both of their known pheromone components, (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate and (Z)-9-tetradecenyl acetate. Female antennal response was found to be 46.3% weaker than that of males, under identical conditions, with male antennae producing significantly higher deflections to the higher pheromone doses tested and to the plant volatile,(E)-2-hexanal. Observations of females in clean air versus (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate-permeated air showed no significant differences with respect to onset time, frequency or duration of calling. Females moved significantly less often in a (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate-permeated portion of a flight tunnel than in the corresponding clean-air portion.

N2  - As part of a project to develop tools for the physical exclusion of flightless root weevils, adult black vine weevils (BVW), Otiorhynchus sulcatus (F.), were placed in open enclosures with smooth walls of glass, plastic or aluminum to test their ability to escape by climbing. Enclosure walls were left untreated or were treated with substances known to reduce insect climbing ability: fluoropolymer, powdered talc and lithium grease. No BVW escapes were observed under dry conditions, but all treatments allowed some escapes under wet conditions, suggesting that moisture helps BVW adults scale treated surfaces. The results help explain the ability of root weevils to overcome physical barriers under field conditions.

N2  - The hop aphid, Phorodon humuli (Schrank), flies from hop, Humulus lupulus L., to its overwintering Prunus spp. hosts in the fall. The sources of these aphids were not known because much of the aphid flight occurs after hop plants are removed from fields during harvest. We found that the bottoms of hop plants remaining alive in harvested hop yards averaged 1.7 to 5.8 hop aphids per leaf in three years of sampling. Unharvested hop plants remaining after harvest averaged 32.8 to 127.1 aphids per leaf in two years. Feral hops were also infested with hop aphids in late summer and early fall. Sources for the spring aphid flight from Prunus spp. to hop included Prunus cerasifera Ehrhart, which averaged 44.0 to 105.1 aphids per shoot in two years of sampling. Fruit-type Prunus spp. trees growing on residential properties averaged 0.9 and 11.3 aphids per shoot in the same years but few of these trees were found. Plum and prune orchards averaged 0 to 5.5 aphids per shoot in two years and estimates indicate that orchard trees are much more numerous than other hop aphid host trees. Potential alternative management strategies for hop aphid control are discussed.

N2  - We conducted five laboratory and one field experiments to examine potential host selection mechanisms of Saperda calcarata Say in British Columbia. Olfactory bioassays indicated that female (and possibly male) beetles were attracted to volatiles from leafy twigs of trembling aspen, Populus tremuloides Michaux. However, wounding of the bole, ethanol baiting, or both, did not result in significant orientation toward or attack of trembling aspens in the field. Feeding preferences for trembling aspen were strong for both sexes in choice bioassays, but in no-choice bioassays, females did not discriminate between trembling aspen and black cottonwood, P. trichocarpa Torrey & Gray. Scouler&#039;s willow, Salix scouleriana Barrat in Hooker, was fed upon the least by both sexes. When diameter of bolts offered as oviposition hosts was equalized, frequency of oviposition was similar among the three hosts. Our data suggest that feeding preference is the predominant mechanism of host selection by S. calcarata .

N2  - Of the five species of the damselfly genus Lestes that live in British Columbia, Lestes forcipatus Rambur and L. disjunctus Selys are the most difficult to separate morphologically. Females can be readily distinguished by the size of the ovipositor, but males are difficult to separate. In British Columbia, L. disjunctus is more common, widespread and familiar. Before 1998, when it was first reported in BC, specimens of L. forcipatus were misidentified as L. disjunctus because the former is known mainly from eastern North America and most Lestes species are usually most readily identified using male characters. The identities of museum specimens of the two species were checked and corrected by us as necessary. Ecological and behavioural observations and up-dated distribution maps of the species are presented. Throughout its range in BC, L. forcipatus is mostly sympatric with L. disjunctus but lives in a narrower range of habitats and localities - mostly cool sedge marshes and fens. The two species show some temporal and behavioural separation.

N2  - Post-diapause overwintered larvae and neonates of any generation of the peach twig borer, Anarsia lineatella (Zeller), seek suitable sites to bore into and mine tissue of their host plants, including almond and peach. We tested the hypothesis that larvae are attracted to the same almond volatiles that elicit antennal responses from adult moths. Of five candidate almond semiochemicals [β-bourbonene, (E,E)-α-farnesene, (E)-β-ocimene, nonanal, decenal] tested singly or in binary combination (nonanal, decenal) in laboratory Y-tube olfactometers, only β-bourbonene attracted neonate larvae. β-bourbonene in combination with (EE)-α-farnesene was as attractive as the complete almond volatile blend, indicating that they are key semiochemicals for foraging larvae.

N2  - Experiments were conducted in the Ash-Shoubak apple-growing region of southern Jordan to determine the impact of four management practices on reducing populations of the small red-belted clearwing borer, Synanthedon myopaeformis (Borkhausen) infesting apple cultivars grafted on M26, M109, and M106 rootstocks. Results revealed that use of a ﬂexible wire to mechanically kill insect larvae, mounding soil over the graft-union area, wrapping tree trunks with cheesecloth from the soil surface to a height of 80 cm, and use of an insecticidal paint composed of water, copper sulfate, petroleum oil, and Durusban®, all reduced the insect populations compared with untreated control trees. The insecticidal paint treatment caused the greatest population reduction. More S. myopaeformis larvae were recovered from the main trunk of the trees than from main and sub-main lateral branches.

N2  - Laboratory flight-tunnel and field mark-release-recapture experiments were conducted to compare pheromone response, flight activity and recapture of wild codling moths, Cydia pomonella (L.), with codling moths mass-reared by the Okanagan-Kootenay Sterile Insect Release Programme. These experiments were designed to identify factors that may contribute to poor pheromone trap catches of sterile moths in the spring. Irradiation (250 Gy) had no influence on catches of n1ass-reared moths in pheromone traps at spring (16°C) or summer temperatures (25°C) in flight-tunnel assays. In field experiments however, recapture of n1ass-reared and wild moths in pheromone traps was significantly reduced after irradiation, suggesting effects of irradiation were modified by additional factors acting in the field. Catches of mass-reared moths in flight-t1mnel assays showed a nonlinear increase with increasing temperature. There was no evidence that n1ass- reared moths were less responsive to pheromone at low temperatures than wild moths. Based on x-intercepts of linear regressions of percent catch vs. temperature (15 - 25°C), flight-temperature thresholds for mass-reared (14.7°C) and wild moths (15.4°C) were similar in flight-tunnel assays. Irradiated moths carried for 4 h on all-terrain vehicles used for delivering sterile moths were less responsive to pheromone lures in subsequent flight-tunnel assays than moths that spent no time on these vehicles, but only when flown at spring-like temperatures (16°C). In field tests, moths released on the ground were caught significantly less often than moths released within the tree canopy and negative effects of ground release appeared greater when made in spring compared with autumn.

N2  - Experimental plots of potatoes were baited with rolled oats in spring to assess the relationship between counts of Pacific coast wireworm, Limonius canus (Coleoptera: Elateridae), and end-of-the-season damage to potato tubers. Baiting was done at seven intervals beginning before planting of potatoes and ending following plant emergence. Injury (percentage of tubers damaged or number of holes per tuber) showed a curvilinear relationship with increasing wireworm counts in baits. Damage increased rapidly with increasing wireworrn numbers at lower densities, eventually ﬂattening out at very high counts. Wireworm counts in baits ﬂuctuated seasonally, increasing from lows obtained during pre-planting samples to a peak just before plant emergence, followed thereafter by declines in counts. Thus, baiting efficiency varied seasonally. Low counts in baits during the pre-planting interval may have been due primarily to low soil temperatures, while declining counts following plant emergence may have been due to the presence of competing food sources (i.e., the seed piece and developing potato plant). I also assessed depth of wireworms in the soil profile between late-March and mid-May, and found that a relatively large percentage (approaching 25% on two dates) of wireworms occurred very deep in the soil (61-91 cm) until soil temperatures at 31 cm approached 17 °C in early- to mid-May. Thus, low counts in baits during the pre-planting samples may also have occurred in part because a proportion of the population was deep in the soil during this time interval. Seasonal variation in baiting efficiency led to date-to-date differences in predicted damage for a given wireworm count. Low efficiency during the preplanting interval would complicate efforts to use pre-planting baiting as a means to predict end-of-the-season tuber damage.

N2  - Blueberry scorch Virus is a new and important pathogen of blueberry in British Columbia, Canada of which the blueberry-infesting aphid Ericaphis fimbriata is a known Vector. In a study of the movement of apterous E. fimbriata , significantly more aphids fell when one ladybird beetle was added to E. fimbriata infested blueberry branches than when zero, two, or four were added. Similar numbers of aphids fell in the presence or absence of beetles at low aphid density (10-30 aphids per terminal), but more fell in the presence of beetles at high aphid density (50-70 aphids per terminal). The time taken for aphids to move a minimum distance of 60 cm off infested plants onto uninfested plants decreased with increasing aphid density which has important implications for the spread of the Virus.

N2  - Canada&#039;s only apiocerid fly, Apiocera barri Cazier, and sole westem mydid fly, Nemamydas pantherinus (Gerstäcker), (Diptera: Apioceridae and Mydidae) are rare species practically restricted to the antelope-brush, Purshia tridentata (Pursh) de Candolle (Rosaceae), steppe of the southern Okanagan Valley of British Columbia. Some aspects of their natural history are outlined. The distributional records of the species are recorded and mapped in the context of antelope-brush steppe in the Okanagan Valley. This ecosystem has been reduced to one-third of the area occupied in the 1860s. Because these two flies are conspicuous, rare, and dependent to a large extent on antelopebrush steppe, they are good candidates for further study in the federal and provincial efforts to conserve this threatened ecosystem and its many rare species.

N2  - A spider survey was conducted over the summer of 2003 on Chichagof Island, Alaska, USA. Based on this, as well as on data from a preliminary survey in 2002, and two subsequent visits, a preliminary list of 95 spider species is presented for the island. This survey resulted in 10 new species records for Alaska and 8 species not known to occur in British Columbia. The data were tested for completeness using Chao 1, Chao 2, bootstrap, and Michaelis-Menten species richness equations. The number of species observed fell within the variance for both Chao indicators but was below the other two estimators indicating that more species may still be found. Twenty-two micro and three macro habitats were defined in the survey. All data were submitted to the Nearctic Spider Database and cataloged on the Denver Museum of Nature & Science’s website.

N2  - Surveys conducted in the South Okanagan Valley, British Columbia, revealed that a new leafhopper pest of grapes, the western grape leafhopper (WGL), Erythroneura elegantula Osborn, was widespread and often abundant in Vineyards on the east side of the Valley from just north of Penticton south to the United States border. Infestations occurred on drier upland sites where most commercial grape production occurs. The largest populations of up to 40 nymphs per leaf were recorded from commercial Vineyards that had applied reduced rates of the insecticide carbaryl for control of the Virginia creeper leafhopper, E. ziczac Walsh.

N2  - Anagrus spp. are important natural regulators of leafhoppers infesting grapes, tree fruits, and other crops in south central British Columbia (BC). Predominantly four species of these egg parasitoids, A. atomus (L.), A. avalae Soyka, A. daanei Triapitsyn, and A. erythroneurae Triapitzyn and Chiappini, were reared from dormant host plants and from summer host plants in the Okanagan Valley. The largest numbers of Anagrus specimens were collected from roses, Rosa spp; blackberry, Rubus spp; apple, Malus domestica ; and other members of the rose (Rosaceae) family. Species of mint, family Lamiaceae, were important host plants for several species, with lavender, Lavendula angustifolia , and garden sage, Salvia oﬁcinalis , being both a summer and winter host plant for some species. The most likely leafhopper host on these plants is the mint leafhopper, Eupteryx melissae Curtis. This study contributes to our knowledge of the biology of Anagrus species in south central BC and could contribute to future efforts to preserve or enhance populations of these beneficial insects.

N2  - Anagrus daanei S. Triapitsyn, A. erythroneurae S. Trjapitzin and Chiappini, and A. frettakovae S. Triapitsyn parasitize Western grape leaﬂlopper, Erythroneura elegantula Osborn, and Virginia creeper leafhopper, E. ziczac Walsh, eggs during the summer. These leafhoppers overwinter as adults and Anagrus overwinter in leafhopper eggs. Thus, Anagrus must find other leafhopper eggs in which to overwinter. To identify plants on which these parasitoids and their host eggs overwinter, we collected 31 species of plants from 52 sites in the grape growing region of south central Washington and north central Oregon during the winter from 2000 to 2007. A total of 733 female and 1066 male Anagrus was reared from the plants. Twelve plant species harboured Anagrus spp. during the winter. Anagrus erythroneurae was reared from blackberry, Rubus armeniacus Focke; willow, Salix spp.; Wood’s rose, Rosa woodsii Lindley; sweetbrier rose, R. eglanteria L.; rugose rose, R. rugosa Thunberg; and ornamental roses, Rosa spp. L. Anagrus tretiakovae was found on choke cherry, Prunus virginiana L.; rugose rose; Rosa spp.; and blackberry. Only one specimen, from omamental rose, was tentatively identified as A. daanei . Other specimens were identified as A. atomus L., A. avalae Soyka, A. nr. sp. avalae , A. nr. sp. columbi Perkins, A. nigriventris Girault, and A. nr. sp. nigriventris .

N2  - Western ﬂower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), is an economic pest of apples in orchards of North America. Western ﬂower thrips causes damage (“pansy spot”) to apples by its egglaying activities during the bloom and immediate post—bloom periods. Difficulties in monitoring this pest and incomplete understanding of its biology during the bloom period have complicated control efforts in apple orchards. Densities of western ﬂower thrips were monitored in seven (2003) or eight (2004) apple orchards at each of four bloom stages; in each orchard, thrips counts in blossom clusters were estimated at four to six distances into the orchard from an orchard edge that abutted native sagebrush-steppe habitat. We hypothesized that numbers of thrips in blossoms would decline with increasing distance along transects into orchards if the native habitat acted as a source of thrips. Thrips numbers in blossom clusters peaked at full bloom and petal fall. Densities showed a linear drop with increasing distance into the orchard, which we interpreted as evidence that the native habitat adjacent to each orchard did indeed act as a source of thrips moving into the orchards. Pansy spot incidence declined with increasing distance into the orchard. The major drop in damage occurred between the border row trees and samples taken at the adjacent distance (nine m away), suggesting that border rows adjacent to native habitats should be monitored with particular care. Regression analyses showed that damage and thrips density were positively correlated, albeit with substantial levels of unexplained variation in levels of damage.

N2  - Both orchard and adjacent native vegetation harboured adult western ﬂower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), from early spring until fall. Frankliniella occidentalis made up the great majority of adults collected in ﬂowers of most plant species sampled, including apple. Other species found on apple ﬂowers included Anaphothrips obscurus Muller, which lives on grasses, and Thrips brevipilosus Moulton. A mixture of thrips species, including F. occidentalis , Scirtothrzps citri (Moulton), Thrips tabaci Lindeman, and Thrips treherni Preisner, occurred on apple shoots. Thrips were found in orchards as early as green tip (early April), with the highest concentrations of F. occidentalis in shoots occurring in June and July. Thrips declined in late summer as shoots formed dormant buds; however, some F. occidentalis adults were still found in early September. Five common woody plants and forbs selected for sampling in the sagebrush-steppe habitat had F. occidentalis adults present, especially during bloom. Western ﬂower thrips can exploit open ﬂowers or young shoots from spring through fall in native vegetation because of the diversity of plants and their different growth habits.

N2  - Adult western ﬂower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), were most abundant on ﬂower clusters of apple, Malus × domestica Borkhausen, from king bloom to full bloom. Low numbers of thrips remained on the clusters after petal fall as fruit enlarged. Thrips larvae peaked in numbers after densities of adults had peaked, usually by petal fall. Two staining procedures were developed for detecting thrips eggs in the surface of fruit ovary tissues (the edible portion of fruit), and in other blossom tissues (stamen, style, calyx, stem and leaves). Eggs were abundant in the latter tissues throughout the bloom and post—bloom periods; the calyx appeared to be highly preferred. Few eggs were detected in fruit ovary tissues during bloom. Egg numbers in ovary tissues began to increase about 8-13 d after full bloom, when fruit had grown beyond 5 mm diameter. The most effective timing of pesticides corroborated the oviposition data. Formetanate hydrochloride or spinosad caused the greatest reduction in oviposition injury (pansy spot) when applied from full bloom to about 5 mm fruit diameter.

N2  - Five Wireworrn species ( Agriotes obscurus , A. sputator , Limonius canus , Ctenicera destructor , and C. pruinina ) were exposed to clothianidin and chlorpyrifos at various concentrations using a Potter Spray Tower to compare larval susceptibilities to these compounds. Wireworms were stored in containers with soil at 15 °C after insecticide exposure, and their post-application health was evaluated weekly for up to 140 days. Where possible, LC50, LC90, LT50, and LT90 values were calculated and the LC90 and LT90 values of chemical concentrations compared between species. Considerable differences in susceptibility to both chlorpyrifos and clothianidin were observed among species, with the LC90 of L. canus exposed to clothianidin being significantly higher than A. obscurus or A. sputator . Similarly, while the LC50 of A. sputator exposed to chlorpyrifos was similar to that of C. pruinina and A. obscurus assayed in previous studies (0.05, 0.10, 0.10%, respectively), there was low (12.5%) mortality of L. canus at the highest concentration tested (0.15%). There were considerable differences in the survival of various wireworm species after exposure to clothianidin at 0.15%, with the LT90 of L. canus (66.5 days) similar to those of C. pruinina and C. destructor (52.5, 59.5 days, respectively), but much shorter than those for A. obscurus or A. sputator (122.5, 115.5 days, respectively). Considerable differences in the induction of and recovery from morbidity induced by the chemicals were observed among species. Most larvae of A. sputator and A. obscurus exposed to chlorpyrifos were moribund before C. prumina larvae (4, 7, 42 days after exposure, respectively). Most (proportion = 0.86) larvae of L. canus recovered from morbidity induced by chlorpyrifos, but a high proportion (>08) of moribund A. sputator , A. obscurus , and C. pruinina died. Larvae of C. destructor and C. pruinina which were moribund after exposure to clothianidin at 0.15% died or recovered sooner than larvae of L. canus and A. obscurus . Together these results suggest that the efficacy of both clothianidin and chlorpyrifos for wireworm control in the field are affected by the wireworm species present.

(Ericaceae) and the incidence of Blueberry scorch virus (BlScV) was determined. Two applications of kaolin clay reduced the number of alatae collected on treated ‘Berkeley’ plants by as much as a factor of eight between 4 June and 16 August. However, five of 100 test plants located near infected fields and exposed only to migrant alatae between 10 May and 16 August became infected with BlScV: three controls and two treated with kaolin clay. The work demonstrates the importance of migrant alatae in the spread of BlScV; 5% transmission is consistent with previous estimates of annual virus spread by winged and non-winged aphids. Three of the plants became infected between 10 and 27 May (one control and two treated with kaolin clay), indicating the importance of aphid ﬂights in May for virus transmission. Rainfall removed much of the kaolin clay and this may have affected its efficacy. The aphid data demonstrated that migrant alatae are able to discriminate between untreated and kaolin—treated blueberry plants, and that Ericaphis fimbriata (Richards), which utilizes blueberry as a host, discriminates better than other migrant species. Water trap data do not necessarily reflect the total migrant aphid composition found on plants in the field. Plant growth was not affected by the kaolin clay, but the fruit had clay residues amongst the bracts of the calyx limiting the use of this product on producing fields to the period before fruit set. Kaolin clay may be best suited to protection of nursery stock, but further work is needed to improve efficacy during wet weather and determine optimal application frequency.

N2  - The Praying Mantis, Mantis religiosa , was introduced into eastern North America in the 1890s and is now a common species throughout much of the eastern United States and southern Ontario and Quebec. It was introduced from Ontario into the southern interior of British Columbia to control grasshoppers in 1937 and 1938. These introductions became established only in the southern Okanagan Valley where populations have persisted from Okanagan Falls south to Osoyoos. Since the late 1990s, the species’ range has expanded from the South Okanagan north at least to Kamloops and east to Nelson. In addition, in the core of its traditional British Columbia range, the South Okanagan, this mantid has become more commonly encountered during the past decade. M. religiosa has also been collected on Vancouver Island. Specimen, photograph and sight records that document this change in status are listed and discussed and a distribution map is included. Characters used to distinguish M. religiosa from the native Ground Mantis, Litaneutria minor , and the exotic Chinese Mantis, Tenodera aridifolia sinensis , which is available commerciallv as a biocontrol agent are summarized.

N2  - The first Canadian records of the Holarctic species Lampropteryx suﬂumata ([Dems & Schiffermuller], 1775) are documented, based on collections from Alberta and British Columbia. Widespread and common throughout much of Eurasia, the larvae feed on Galium species (Rubiaceae). Diagnostic descriptions and images are provided to aid in future recognition of this species. The specimens were originally detected while constructing a DNA barcoding library for westem North American Geometridae, and provide a good example of how genetic methods can enhance the construction of regional inventories and aid in surveillance for invasive species.

N2  - Transmission of Blueberry scorch virus (BlScV) by the aphid species Ericaphis ﬁmbri ata (Richards), Aphis spiraecola (Patch), Aphis pomi DeGeer, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), Myzus ornatus Laing, Aphis helianthi Monell, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), and Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), was studied in the laboratory using timed aphid acquisition feeding periods and known numbers of aphid vectors. Successful infection of Nicotiana occidentalis Wheeler (Solanaceae), a newly identified herbaceous host, and highbush blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum L. (Ericaceae), following brief virus-acquisition feeds lasting less than 5 min, demonstrated that BlScV was transmitted in a nonpersistent, non-circulative manner. Based on transfer of 10 aphids per plant, the most efficient vector of BlScV from infected to healthy N. occidentalis was M. ornatus . Compared with this herbaceous host, infection rates for blueberry were much lower even though higher numbers of aphids (25/plant) were used. The highest rate of infection for blueberry (20%) was achieved when the green colour form of E. fimbriata was used to transmit the virus. The relatively low rate of transmission from infected to healthy blueberry suggests that BlScV would spread slowly in the field. Planting of certified virus-free nursery material and aggressive removal of infected plants should help control this economically important disease of highbush blueberries.

N2  - Y-tube and parallel tube olfactometers were used to test for attraction between and within genders of the European paper wasp, Polistes dominulus (Christ). In the Y-tube olfactometer, umnated females were attracted to male odour, while males were repelled by umnated female odour. Males and females were not attracted to the odour of the same sex in this experiment. In the parallel tube olfactometer, females were attracted to male odour, while males were not attracted to female odour. Morphological sources of potential sex attractants were tested using an arena bioassay design. Males rubbed their mandibles and gaster on the substrate when exposed to extracts of umnated female or male tagmata, female or male legs, or the male seventh gastral sternite. We did not see overt behavioural responses by females to male or female extracts.

N2  - Results of a three-year study demonstrated that Isomate-CM/LR, a polyethylene, single tube-type pheromone dispenser releasing an incomplete mixture of several species&#039; multi-component pheromones is an effective management tool that provides multiplespecies mating disruption for Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris) and Pandemis limitata (Robinson). When applied at a rate of 500 dispensers / ha within the orchard and the equivalent of 2000 dispensers / ha to trees on the orchard perimeter, levels of control were adequate for production of organic apples in British Columbia, Canada. Trap catches with synthetic pheromone lures were reduced by 79-99% and mating of females on mating tables was reduced by 87-98% in these species. At harvest, damage from leafrollers in pheromone-treated organic orchards was below organically-acceptable economic levels (5%) and similar to damage levels observed in insecticide-treated conventional orchards (2%). Over three years, total trap catches of these two leafrollers and their damage decreased in four of five orchards treated with pheromone, but catches and damage from leafrollers increased in one orchard. These indices remained relatively unchanged in paired insecticide-treated conventional orchards over the same three-year period. In pheromone-treated orchards, levels of damage from leafrollers at harvest were positively correlated with total leafroller catches in pheromone monitoring traps. Use of Isomate-CM/LR as a supplemental pest management tactic in organic orchards will help to reduce damage and economic losses from leafrollers that have been increasing under the area-wide codling moth sterile insect programme ongoing in this semi-desert, montane apple production region.

N2  - A validated model of the timing of post-diapause oviposition in the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, was used to predict when 50% of strawberry leaﬂets with T. urticae also have T. urticae eggs (1005) in each year from 1954 to 2006 at Langley, British Columbia. This timing was studied in relation to hours of frost occurring before and after oviposition. Historically, 1005 occurred before there were frost-free days, but there was a clear threshold at 390 h with temperatures <0°C after 1005, which was not exceeded. This suggests that there is selection pressure for early oviposition, but also a limit to the extent of selection. The subzero temperature profile ~1 month before oviposition was clearly different from that after 1005. The number of hours with subzero temperatures 1 month before oviposition, and the standard deviation of those estimates, were negatively correlated with year and indicated that there could be oviposition in January - rather than February - by 2015. Cumulative hours with temperatures <0°C between 27 November (the empirical estimate of the time when T. urticae begins accumulating degree-days for post-diapause oviposition) and 30 April was negatively correlated with year, and extrapolation of a linear regression suggested that there could be selection for continuous armual oviposition by 2050. There was considerable variation in the data, but considered in combination with published evidence for climate change, these results will be important in developing pest management strategies, and furthermore, will impact many aspects of agriculture in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia.

N2  - The biology and management of bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) in Washington cherry orchards was investigated from 2003-2005. Two dominant species were identified attacking cherry ( Prunus spp.) orchards: the shothole borer, Scolytus rugulosus Müller, and an ambrosia beetle, Xyleborinus saxeseni Ratzeburg. S. rugulosus was the species most implicated in damage to healthy trees. Two distinct periods of S rugulosus activity occur in Washington, with a possible partial third in some locations. The first activity period begins in late April and peaks in late May to early June, with the second beginning in mid-July and peaks in late July to early August. Yellow sticky traps (unbaited apple maggot traps) were effective tools to monitor S. rugulosus activity but ethanol-baited intercept-style traps were necessary to monitor X. saxeseni activity. Movement of S. rugulosus into orchards was closely associated with emergence from outside hosts, generally a pile of recently pruned or cut wood placed outside the orchard. S. rugulosus readily moved distances of 10-50 m to attack trees on orchard borders, but did not move more than two or three rows into a healthy orchard. A residue bioassay technique demonstrated that several insecticides caused mortality of S. rugulosus adults. A pyrethroid, esfenvalerate, was the most active 21 d after treatment. Azinphos-methyl was acutely toxic to S. rugulosus , but for only seven d. Endosulfan and the neonicotinyls, thiamethoxam and acetamiprid, were somewhat toxic to S. rugulosus .

N2  - We evaluated whether management of the broadleaf weed dandelion, Taraxacum officinale F.H. Wigg. aggr., affected damage to apples by westem ﬂower thrips ( Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande)). Four commercial apple orchard blocks in central Washington having high densities of dandelion were monitored over a 3-yr period. Herbicides were applied to the drive rows in one-half of each orchard for each year of the study. A 92% reduction in dandelion densities in the low-weed plots was achieved by the third year of the experiment. The number of thrips per dandelion plant did not change as dandelions became less numerous. This resulted in an overall reduction in western ﬂower thrips per unit area on dandelions throughout the course of the trial. However, the number of westem ﬂower thrips in the apple ﬂowers and shoots were not affected by the treatment. Estimated westem ﬂower thrips population density per ha on apple and dandelion indicated that dandelions harboured a much smaller pool of westem ﬂower thrips in comparison to apple. No significant reduction in fruit injury was detected in any year. Thus, reduction or elimination of dandelion from the orchard ﬂoor appears to be of limited value in managing westem ﬂower thrips in apple orchards.

N2  - The effect of pesticides used against codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., on integrated mite management was studied for three years in five or six commercial apple orchards in central Washington. Phytophagous and predatory mites were counted throughout the season in blocks ranging from 0.4-1.6 ha in size treated with four codling moth insecticides. In one year of the study (2006), five out of six orchards experienced elevated mite densities relative to the standard. In four orchards, novaluron caused a 3.0-16.9× increase in mite populations; acetamiprid caused a 2.6-3.4× increase, and thiacloprid caused a 1.7-13.8× increase. In the fifth orchard, the organophosphate standard had an extremely high mite population, in addition to all three experimental treatments. In 2005 and 2007, only one or two orchards had elevated mite levels in the novaluron, acetamiprid, and thiacloprid treatments. Additive effects of codling moth and thinning programs were evaluated in small plot research trials. Treatments with all three elements [1) codling moth insecticide; 2) calcium polysulfide; 3) carbaryl] produced the highest levels ofspider mites. Three sulfur-containing products (calcium polysulfide, ammonium thiosulfate, and dry flowable sulfur) were evaluated for their effect on Galandromus occidentalis (Nesbitt) and apple rust mite, Aculus schlechtendali (Nalepa). All three materials caused suppressed G. occidentalis numbers. Calcium polysulfide caused the greatest reduction in apple rust mite numbers, ammonium thiosulfate the least reduction, with dry flowable sulfur intermediate between the two. Additive effects of codling moth materials, carbaryl, and sulfur-containing products may be causing increased mite levels in Washington orchards.

N2  - Examination of the holotypes, specimens in the type series and material from across their geographical ranges for Haliplus leechi Wallis and H. salmo Wallis shows that the two names are conspecific; H. salmo is placed as a junior subjective synonym of H. leechi . A sexual dimorphism in the relative eye separation is present in members of this complex, H. canadensis Wallis and H subguttatus Roberts. Preliminary data suggest that this dimorphism may also be present in other haliplid species. This dimorphism should be taken into account in constructing keys for the determination of haliplids.

N2  - The long-term presence of Gypsonoma aceriana (Duponchel) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae: Olethreutinae), a European shoot—boring pest of poplars, was discovered in British Columbia during examination of cytochrome c oxidase 1 sequences of voucher specimens deposited in the Canadian Forest Service, Pacific Forestry Centre, arthropod reference collection. Originally identified as a species of Epiblema , G. aceriana was first recovered in BC in 1980, almost 20 years before it was reported in Washington State. DNA barcodes from both larval and adult collections are demonstrated to be conspecific with an adult collection from Great Britain. Preliminary surveys of early and late instar larval feeding damage in southwestem British Columbia demonstrate that this shoot borer is established on southem Vancouver Island and throughout the lower mainland of the province. The eastem-most collections made to date include locations near Yale in the Fraser Canyon, from the lower Coquihalla River watershed and from Hope.

N2  - The distribution of attack density and egg gallery length by the spruce beetle around the bole of windthrown spruce trees was investigated in central British Columbia. In windthrown trees that are oriented north-south or east-west, the circular distributions of both attack density and egg gallery length were significantly different from the uniform distribution. The mean directions for the center of n1ass of the distributions suggest an evolved preference by the spruce beetle for establishing broods relative to habitat quality. The preferred habitats for brood establishment were the shaded bottoms and lower sides of windthrown trees. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that attack preference is a function of solar insulation during the attack period.

N2  - In British Columbia the family Lampyridae (fireflies) is poorly known. Ten species in five genera are recorded but adults of only two species produce flashed bioluminescent signals. Before 1997, museum collections that we examined held specimens of only one flashing species from three BC localities, despite recent and widespread reports of flashing fireflies in the province. A solicitation of specimens and sight records from entomologists and naturalists resulted in the discovery of 14 additional collection localities for the two species. Sight records are summarized but are not recorded in detail. As far as is known, Photuris pennsylvanica (DeGeer) ( sensu lato ), is restricted in BC to the southem Rocky Mountain Trench (East Kootenay region). Photinus obscurellus LeConte, herein recorded in BC for the first time, is widespread in the northeast, central and southem Interior of the province. This paper briefly summarizes the BC lampyrid fauna, examining the status, distribution and biology of the two flashing species in more detail.

N2  - Mountain pine beetle (MPB) is the most damaging insect of mature pine forests in western North America. The current outbreak in British Columbia is the largest ever recorded. During a survey of beetle occurrence, well—established infestations were sampled in central B.C. and found to possess larval mortality. Bacteria or other microbes were among the potential causes of the mortality. Bacteria were isolated from living larvae and adults, as well as larval and adult beetle cadavers found in bark samples. Bacteria were identified by fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis, which indicated 32 species of bacteria present in the MPB laivae. The predominant bacteria ( Serratia liquefaciens , S. plymuthica ) were detected in about a third of all sampled laivae, regardless of mortality. Rahnella aquatilis was found in 11% of all larvae examined and was usually (93%) associated with laival mortality. Interactions between two bluestaining fungal symbionts of the MPB ( Grosmannia clavigera , Ophiostoma montium ) and two of the isolated bacteria ( S. liquefaciens and R. aquatilis ) were assessed. S. liquefaciens and R. aquatilis both inhibited the growth of beetle-associated bluestain fungi by 72%. The bluestain fungi did not impede bacterial growth, and both bacteria grew on autoclaved bluestain mycelium. Combinations of the two bacterial species formed aggregates on practical-grade (crab) chitin, but there was no aggregation in pure cultures or on the autoclaved mycelium of G. clavigera or O. montium . These results indicated that the two bacteria may be capable of aggregation within the insects, and this may have implications for their combined effects in the beetle. The role of S. liquefaciens and R. aquatilis in MPB biology requires further investigation.

N2  - The cereal leaf beetle (CLB), Oulema melanopus , a serious pest in oats, barley and wheat, is a relatively new pest on the west coast of North America. To determine if adults showed a preference for oat stands of different ages, we examined adult and egg densities in four sequentially planted oat stands in the Willamette Valley, Oregon, in 2005 and 2006. Adults moved from earlier to later plantings (from older to younger oats) during the growing season, particularly once the ﬂag leaf had emerged in earlier plantings. In 2005, the seasonal pattem in egg counts tended to match that of adult counts in the first three oat plantings. The egg to adult ratio was greater in the earlier planted (older) oats, particularly the first planting. The egg to adult ratio was more variable in 2006. Adults spent the most physiological time (degree—days) in the second oat planting, and total egg numbers were highest in the second and third plantings. Data suggest that delayed planting as a trap crop management tool for CLB is complex and potentially ineffective.

N2  - Field studies were conducted in sex pheromone—treated apple orchards to evaluate the performance of a clear 0.11 m2 vertical interception trap coated with oil and baited with either (E,E)-8-10-dodecadien-1-ol (codlemone), ethyl (E, Z)-2,4—decadienoate (pear ester), or both attractants (combo) for adult codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.). Interception traps baited with codlemone or pear ester caught significantly more males only or both sexes than unbaited traps, respectively. Interception and delta traps baited with codlemone caught similar numbers of males. Interception traps baited with pear ester caught up to 8-fold more males and 30-fold more females than similarly baited delta traps, respectively. Seasonal catches of females did not differ between light and pear ester—baited interception traps. Delta traps caught significantly more males, fewer females, and a similar number of total moths as the interception trap when both were baited with the combo lure. These data suggest that new clear trap designs can be developed to increase catches of female codling moth which may enhance seasonal monitoring and establish more useful predictive population models.

Water—pan traps in commercial rhubarb in the Matanuska—Susitna River Valley near Palmer and in the USDA ARS Rheum gerrnplasm collection caught aphids belonging to eight species: Aphis helianthi Monell; Chaitophorus neglectus Hottes and Friso, Euceraphis betulae (Koch); Hayhurstia atriplicis (L.); Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas); Myzus persicae (Sulzer); Pemphigus spp. ; and Rhopalosiphum padi (L.). Only three of the species ( M. euphorbiae , M. persicae , and R. padz ) collected in water— pan traps were also handpicked from rhubarb plants. The bird cherry—oat aphid, R. padi , was the most abundant species collected in water-pan traps and from rhubarb plants. Based on their disease transmission capability, A. helianthi , M. euphorbiae , M. persicae , and R. padi , can be considered to be of potential economic importance to rhubarb production in Alaska.

N2  - In each of the 6 years of this study in south central Washington state, male corn earworm moths, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), first appeared in pheromone traps in late May to mid June, and thereafter were present nearly continuously until mid to late October. Maximum numbers of male corn earworm moths captured in pheromone traps occurred in August and early September. Male  Heliothis phloxiphaga (Grote and Robinson) moths first appeared in traps baited with corn earworm pheromone and conspecific pheromone in April, and were generally present throughout the season until mid to late September. In some years, two peaks of trap capture of H. phloxiphaga males was suggestive of two generations per season, with one flight in April and May and the other in July and August.  Although both species were caught primarily in traps baited with their appropriate conspecific pheromone, smaller numbers of both species were captured in traps baited with the heterospecific pheromone.  Heliothis phloxiphaga captured in corn earworm pheromone traps can be misidentified as corn earworm, resulting in false positives for corn earworm in commercial sweet corn or overestimates of corn earworm populations.

N2  - One hundred thirty species of native and introduced plants growing in uncultivated land adjacent to apple and pear orchards of central Washington and northern Oregon were sampled for the presence of the western flower thrips (WFT) Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande, 1895) and potential thrips predators. Plants were sampled primarily while in flower. Flowering hosts for WFT were available from late-March to late-October. Adult WFT occurred on 119 plant species and presumed WFT larvae were present on 108 of 119 species. Maximum observed WFT density on several plant species exceeded 100 individuals (adults and larvae) per gram dry weight of plant material. The most abundant predator was Orius tristicolor (White, 1879) (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae). It was collected on 64 plant species, all of which were hosts for WFT. The second most abundant predators were spiders (Araneae). Small spider immatures (first and second instars) of several species were common on certain host plants, and are likely to feed on WFT.

N2  - The European plant bug Asciodema obsoleta (Fieber) develops mainly on Scotch broom, Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link; it is one of several broom insects that apparently have been introduced to North America with shipments of nursery stock. This mirid first was reported in North America from British Columbia (Vancouver, Vancouver Island, Bowen Island) in 1966, but no additional records have been published. Based on specimens in BC museums and our recent field work, we extend the previously recorded BC distribution of A. obsoleta and provide the first U.S. record: Washington State (Point Roberts, Whatcom County).

Six species resulted: Catallagia dacenkoi Ioff, Corrodopsylla curvata (Rothschild), Ctenophthalmus pseudagyrtes Baker, Megabothris calcarifer (Wagner), Amalaraeus dissimilis (Jordan) and Peromyscopsylla ostsibirica (Scalon). Ten species of fleas were previously recorded from the upper Koyukuk River watershed. One female specimen each of C. curvata and Ct. pseudagyrtes from the KNWR are the only new fleas added to the upper watershed list.

N2  - We surveyed the parasitoids and hyperparasitoids of the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae , and the foxglove aphid, Aulacorthum solani in the lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada. Field surveys were conducted using isolated pepper plants, with aphids, as trap plants. Primary parasitoids recorded from field surveys were Aphidius ervi , A. matricariae , Praon gallicum , P. unicum , P. humulaphidis , Ephedrus californicus , Diaeretiella rapae , Monoctonus paulensis , Aphelinus abdominalis and A. asychis . Diaretiella rapae only emerged from green peach aphids, and Ephedrus californicus only emerged from foxglove aphids. Aphidius matricariae was the most abundant primary parasitoid species reared from both aphid species. Hyperparasitoid species collected belonged to the genera Dendrocerus , Asaphes , Alloxysta , Pachyneuron and Syrphophagous . In greenhouses, Dendrocerus carpenteri was the dominant hyperparasitoid species. Aphidius and Aphelinus spp. were attacked by hyperparasitoids at similar rates. In the field, Aphidius spp. were attacked by five species of hyperparasitoid, and Aphelinus spp. were attacked by one, Alloxysta ramulifera . In general, the rate of attack by hyperparasitoids was much lower in field surveys than in our collections from greenhouses.

N2  - Since the last publication of a checklist of the Orthoptera of British Columbia, much has been learned about the group. New information has come from a variety of web-based resources as well as new collections. An updated checklist is presented, listing 104 resident species in the province. Two of these species are represented by two subspecies in BC. Eight species have been added since the last list was published, including newly discovered native species and newly established non-native species. Records of six species have been found to be based on misidentified specimens and these species have been deleted from the checklist. An additional 16 species are considered hypothetical and may one day be confirmed to occur in BC.

N2  - Bombus vosnesenskii , the distinctively-patterned Yellow-faced Bumble Bee, has undergone a significant and rapid range extension in British Columbia. Known initially from a single record of a few specimens at Osoyoos in 1951, it was put forward in 1996 as a species that warranted a threatened or endangered status because of its severely restricted range in the province. However, since 2000, the species has expanded north in the Okanagan Valley, west to the Similkameen Valley and, especially, has become firmly established in south coastal regions of the province, including Vancouver Island. Population increases in B. vosnesenskii to the south of BC have also been reported. The reasons for the rapid expansion of B. vosnesenskii in BC are unclear. Particularly in lowland southwestern BC, the range expansion might have been enhanced through escapes from colonies kept as pollinators of agricultural crops. The spread of B. vosnesenskii has coincided with the decline of B. occidentalis , so the former may have been introduced or naturally expanded its range at the same time as a niche was becoming vacant.

N2  - Sugars and several plant essential oils were evaluated as feeding stimulants for larvae of Pacific coast wireworm, Limonius canus (Coleoptera: Elateridae). Compounds were evaluated by quantifying biting rates of wireworms on treated filter paper disks, modifying a method used previously in assays with Agriotes wireworms. Independent counts of the same disk showed that the method led to repeatable estimates of biting rate. Higher rates of biting were obtained on filter paper disks if those disks had been treated with sucrose, fructose, glucose, maltose, and galactose, than if the disks were left untreated. Sucrose and fructose were more stimulatory than the other 3 sugars. Biting rates declined with decreasing concentrations of sugars in water. Combining a highly stimulatory sugar (sucrose) with certain plant essential oils in some cases led to non-additive (both synergistic and antagonistic) effects on biting rates. We discuss the possible role for this type of assay in developing insecticide-laced baits for attract-and-kill programs.

N2  - The survival of Grapholita molesta (Busck) on the synthetic diet currently used by the Okanagan Sterile Insect Release Programme in British Columbia to rear Cydia pomonella L. was compared to that on a synthetic diet normally used to rear G. molesta and crab apples as a control. Development of G. molesta on the three diets was followed from egg to adult. The fitness of the resulting moths was compared using metrics of survival to pupation and pupal weight, survival to adulthood and female fecundity.  More G. molesta reached the pupal stage and had a significantly greater pupal mass when reared on the G. molesta diet than on the C. pomonella or crab apple diets. There was no difference among the number of moths surviving to adulthood on any of the diet types. Although pupal mass was affected by larval diet, G. molesta females had a statistically similar number of offspring regardless of the diet they were reared on as larvae.  Grapholita molesta can be reared on the diet currently used to mass rear C. pomonella for sterile insect release but may require a period of adaptation to the novel food source. If G. molesta becomes established in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, a similar sterile insect release approach to that currently used against C. pomonella may be a feasible approach.

N2  - To improve knowledge of ground beetle communities and the influence of habitat succession on these communities in Alaska, adult ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) activity and diversity was documented on Conservation Research Program (CRP) agricultural lands in Delta Junction, Alaska (64ºN, 145ºW). Twenty species, based on a total sample of 6,116 specimens, were collected during 2006 and 2007 from plots that were in the CRP for 9 years (young-field plots) and 19 years (old-field plots). Two species, Cymindis cribricollis Dejean and Amara obesa Say, are reported for the first time for Alaska. Species richness of carabids for our study plots was estimated using the Chao 1 and Chao 2 estimators to be 22 and 28 species, respectively. Ninety-four percent of the specimens belonged to five species Pterostichus adstrictus Eschscholtz (42.9%), Agonum cupreum Dejean (17.9%), Calathus ingratus Dejean (15%), Amara obesa (11.1%), and Dicheirotrichus cognatus (Gyllenhal) (7.1%). Only Ag. cupreum showed significant effects based on plot age. The majority of carabid activity occurred late in the season, from mid September to early October. A comparison of our findings is made with historical data (1943-1956) from the collection of the Matanuska Experiment Station now incorporated into the University of Alaska Museum Insect Collection.

N2  - This research provides mitochondrial COI sequences and species-specific reverse primers for Aphidius ericaphidis Pike and Starý, Ephedrus incompletus Provencher, and Praon unicum Smith (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), which are primary parasitoids of Ericaphis fimbriata (Richards) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), an important vector of Blueberry scorch virus (BlScV) on highbush blueberry Vaccinium corymbosum L. (Ericales: Ericaceae) in the Pacific Northwest. The COI sequences are deposited under accession numbers EU574902, EU574904, GU237131, KC211020-211024, KC211027-211032.  The combination of three primers in a multiplex PCR assay detects and differentiates DNA from adults of all three parasitoid species. When individual field-collected aphids were challenged with the multiplex PCR assay, immatures of the two numerically dominant species, A. ericaphidis and P. unicum , were readily detected as was multiparasitism by these two species. The uncommon species, E. incompletus , was detected less frequently by multiplex PCR assay than by rearing from the aphid hosts. The diagnostic molecular markers are useful tools for estimating of rates of parasitism and for identifying immatures of parasitoid species within aphid hosts, particularly if used in combination with rearing and dissection assays of field-collected aphids.

N2  - Seasonal flight pattern of the western balsam bark beetle, Dryocoetes confusus Swaine, in stands of subalpine fir, Abies lasiocarpa (Hook) Nutt., in north-central British Columbia was monitored for three years using multiple-funnel traps baited with (±)- exo -brevicomin.  There were two major flight periods per year, the first commencing in mid- to late June, and the second occurring in mid- to late August.  The first flight was predominantly males, while the second flight was composed primarily of females, probably reemerged parent adults.  Little flight occurred until within-stand temperatures exceeded 15ºC.  Traps placed 6 m above ground caught 4 times as many beetles as traps placed 2 m above ground.  Our results indicate that semio-chemical-based manipulation of the western balsam bark beetle should be implemented by early May.

N2  - We examined the effects of photoperiod on reproductive diapause of three haplotypes of potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Hemiptera: Triozidae), collected from three geographic locations: south Texas (Central haplotype), California (Western haplotype), and Washington State (Northwestern haplotype). Psyllids were reared from egg hatch to adult eclosion under short- and long-day conditions, to determine whether short-days led to a lack of mating, delays in ovarian development, and accumulation of fat by female psyllids. Our expectation was that a reproductive response to short-days would be more likely to be exhibited by psyllids of the northern-latitude haplotype (Northwestern) than psyllids of the other two haplotypes. We also examined whether this species exhibited a photoperiod-controlled polymorphism in body size, as observed in other psyllid species, by comparing six body and wing measures of psyllids reared under short- and long-day conditions. Virtually 100% of females of each haplotype exhibited both egg maturation and mating at both long- and short-day conditions, providing no evidence that this species exhibits a photoperiod-induced reproductive diapause. Fat was present in most psyllids, although with higher probability of presence in short-day females than long-day females. Phortoperiod had no effect on body size. We found differences among haplotypes in body size, with psyllids from Washington State (Northwestern haplotype) having larger wings and longer tibiae than psyllids of the two southern populations. Our photoperiod results, combined with overwintering observations for this species and for other Triozidae, prompted us to hypothesize that potato psyllid -- at least in the Pacific Northwest growing region -- overwinters in a temperature-controlled quiescence rather than in a true diapause.

N2  - Lodgepole pine ( Pinus contorta Dougl. ex. Loud. var latifolia ) seed orchards in British Columbia, Canada, suffer from low seedset problems. Seedset can be improved by installing mesh bags over the 2nd-year cones. One mechanism of improved seedset has been shown to be exclusion of the seed-feeding Western Conifer Seedbug, Leptoglossus occidentalis , but the possibility of microclimate alteration leading to improved seedset has not been carefully explored. We measured the internal cone temperatures of cones both inside and outside mesh bags, as well as the relative humidity around cones both inside and outside bags. We also installed time-lapse cameras that, every 5 minutes, photographed unbagged cones situated near bagged cones, and examined the photographs for feeding by L. occidentalis . Internal temperatures of cones inside bags were warmer, accumulated more heat units, and had higher peak temperatures than cones outside bags. Humidity was slightly higher inside bags in late-season, particularly during rainy days. The evidence did not support the hypothesis that microclimate change is the cause of improved seedset inside bags. On the other hand, the cameras showed extensive feeding by L. occidentalis on unbagged cones, and showed a strong correlation between the amount of time a cone was fed upon and the subsequent seedset. Therefore the increase in seedset due to the mesh bags is not related to microclimate change, but is caused by exclusion of L. occidentalis .

N2  - Studying yellowjackets is challenging due to their cryptic nesting behaviour, short field season, and extreme variation in population density. Developing or perfecting techniques for rearing yellowjackets would greatly increase the opportunity of studying the communication ecology of yellowjackets and the evolution of eusociality in the Hymenoptera. Our objective was to assess a method for rearing the five Vespula congeners V. acadica (Sladen), V. alascensis Packard, V. atropilosa (Sladen), V. germanica (F.), and V. pensylvanica (de Saussure) . In early spring of 2014, we collected queens of each of the five species from the field and placed them singly in a plywood nest box connected to a mesh cylinder that served as a foraging arena and provided constant access to water and food (honey, live flies, and live caterpillars). For each queen, we recorded nest initiation, the attachment site of the nest pedicel, and the stage of nest development at the end of the experiment, 9 weeks after the last collection date of queens. Queens of V. germanica (n=18) , V. alascensis (n=11) , V. acadica (n=4) , V. pensylanica (n=23) and V. atropilosa (n=11) had nest inititation rates of 61%, 50%, 25%, 17%, and 0%, respectively. The mean number of nest cells built by queens of V. germanica , V. alascensis , V. acadica , V. pensylvanica , and V. atroplisoa were 21.6 ± 4.6, 17.8 ± 6.3, 8.0, 26.5 ± 8.3, and 0, respectively. Two V. germanica queens and one V. pensylvanica queens established nests that produced a few worker wasps. While our rearing method compares favorably to, and in some aspects improves, previous rearing methods, further refinements are needed to generate the large numbers of wasp workers that are essential for experimental testing of hypotheses pertinent to life history traits of yellowjackets.

N2  - Oregon Branded Skipper (Hesperia colorado oregonia Edwards), is an Endangered butterfly extant at 6 remaining sites on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. I studied the habitat associations of this subspecies within a coastal sand ecosystem at Cordova Shore on southeast Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Little is known about habitat requirements for this butterfly; however, because of its Endangered status, information on its habitat is required to help direct conservation action. During the summers of 2013 and 2014, I compared habitat conditions at occupied and simultaneously unoccupied sites. I used conditional logistic regression for matched pairs to investigate relationships between butterfly presence and six habitat variables in 21 occupied and 21 random plots and used Akaike information criterion (AIC) to identify the best among a set of 20 candidate models. Most of the butterflies (91%) were observed within the Dune wildrye – Beach pea ( Leymus mollis - Lathyrus japonicas ) terrestrial ecosystem. The best supported model included black knotweed ( Polygonum paronychia ) and Oregon gumweed ( Grindelia oregonia ) as the sole variables predicting the occurrence of Oregon Banded Skipper. The model predicted that the likelihood that Oregon Branded Skipper will be present increases with increases in the cover of Oregon gumweed (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 0.9-2.6) and black knotweed (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 0.1-23.6). The two plants are likely important for the Skipper; however, small sample sizes and model confidence intervals suggest a cautionary approach to applying the model. In light of these findings, I provide guidance for future conservation of Oregon Branded Skipper to land managers within Cordova Shore.

N2  - Apple clearwing moth (ACM), Synanthedonmyopaeformis Borkhausen (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae), wasdiscovered in an apple orchard in Cawston, British Columbia in 2005. This xylophagous, invasive Europeanspecies has become a serious problem in high-density apple orchards wheresize-controlling rootstocks are attacked by the wood-boring larvae. Seven screening trials with reduced-riskinsecticides for conventional (seven treatments) and organic apple production (threetreatments) were established in two commercial high-density mixed-variety appleplantings in Cawston. Our objectiveswere (1) to screen several new synthetic insecticides having novel chemistriesthat purportedly have reduced risks, (2) to evaluate use of several organically-approvedspray materials, including nematodes, and (3) to compare the efficacy ofvarious products when applied at different times during the growing season. Single, hand-gun sprays delivering treatmentsin 2000 L of water ha-1 at 200 psi were applied as curative sprays targeting mature larvae inrootstock-scion graft unions in May and October 2008, and June 2009. Among seven treatments tested, only theinsect growth regulator, Rimon® 10 EC (10% novaluron), at 2.4 L a.i.ha-1, caused significant reductions in adult emergence compared withuntreated controls in all experiments.  Whenapplied twice as preventativetreatments during flight of male ACM in 2008, Altacor®, Belt®,Delegate™ and Rimon all caused significant reductions in adult emergence thefollowing year; Rimon caused the greatest reduction (-96.4%). In a similar 2009 trial only Rimon reducedpopulations the following year. One curative or two preventative applications of the organic materials, Entrust®,Crocker’s Fish Oil®, or Purespray Green Oil™, at anyspray timing, did not control ACM. The nematode,Steinernema feltiae (Filipjev) (1×105infective juvenile nematodes / 100 ml of water / tree) provided significant controlof ACM in one spring 2008 trial.  In two 2009nematode-only experiments, a sawdust paste tree-trunk barrier applied over nematodeapplications made either in May or August, caused significant reductions in emergenceof ACM adults. Curative tree-trunk spraysof Rimon 10 EC at the tested rate are recommended for control of ACM inconventional apple orchards. There is noeffective organic control for ACM at this time, but tree-trunk barriers andnematodes may warrant further study.

Cerceris fumipennis colonies were discovered for the 1st time in BC in 2012 at Central Park in Merritt. While collecting data on C. fumipennis at the Merritt colony in 2014, five female Cerceris nigrescens Smith were captured in a sweep net and one female had a single clover rootweevil, Sitona hispidulus Fabricius (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in her grasp. One Cerceris nigrescens and a C.fumipennis nest were both excavated demonstrating that the former created brood cells from 3.8 to 7.6 cm below grade, while the latter dug cells 8 to 15.3 cm beneath the surface.
