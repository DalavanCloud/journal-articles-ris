N2  - A detailed study of vegetation at Bendering Reserve was undertaken to improve on the vegetation classifications currently available, and to then apply the classification to vertebrate habitats. The final classification was derived from that of Beard and Webb (1974) by subdividing some of their life-form groups, modifying other aspects of their system, and classifying all strata. Litter and soils were examined in some detail.

N2  - The vegetation of West Bendering Reserve conforms to that found throughout the Avon Botanical District. It has all the major vegetation formlJ.tion types of the wheatbelt represented, except salt complex. This reserve has the major formations much more equitably distributed (in terms of area) than does the neighbouring Bendering Reserve even though the latter is about 3 to 4 times larger. It has 27 distinct associations, averaging 1.69 associations per square km. One' hundred and eighty-seven species of plants were recorded including <em>Santalum spicatum</em> (sandalwood) a species now scarce in the wheatbelt. A contrived index of abundance of senescent trees is presented. Data from West Bendering Reserve is compared with and contrasted to that of Bendering Reserve.

N2  - Three new species are described - <em>Uca elegans</em> sp. nov., <em>U. pavo </em>sp. novo and <em>U. hirsutimanus</em> sp. nov. Another three species - <em>U. coarctata,</em> <em>U. dussumieri </em>and <em>U. vomeris</em>. previously known from the east coast of Australia, are now recorded from the Northern Territory. The range of <em>U. signata</em> is also extended across northern Australia into Western Australia. The presence of <em>U. tetragonon</em> and <em>U. triangularis</em> in Australia is confirmed and it is concluded that <em>U. minima</em> Crane, 1975 is a synonym of <em>U. signata</em> (Hess, 1865). Descriptions of <em>U. australiae </em>Crane, 1975 and <em>U. erassipes</em> (Adams and White, 1848) are included although we do not recognize them as belonging to the 17 confirmed Australian <em>Uca</em> species. Only one male, the holotype, is known of <em>U. australiae</em> and only one specimen of <em>U. crassipes</em> is recorded from Australia. A key, full descriptions, a pull-out chart and colour photographs are provided.

N2  - The Rowley Shoals (comprising three distinct reefs), Scott Reef and nearby Seringapatam Reef form a series of large emergent shelf atolls arising from depths of between 300 and 700 m along the edge of the broad continental shelf about 260 km from mainland north-western Australia. The Rowley Shoals have been descrived as morphologically the most perfect examples of shelf atolls in Australian waters and appear to represent three distinct examples of shelf atolls in Australian waters and appear to represent three distinct stages in atoll formation. Scott Reef has been drilled to reveal an entirely sedimentary sequence to 4720 m at which the Late Triassic was reached. It seems likely that the other atolls also have a marine sedimentary structure and that reef groth has proceeded intermittently since the mid-Miocene, activated by depression of the shelf edge and changes in sea level.

N2  - A total of 389 macromollusc species, all of which are widespread Indo-West Pacific forms, are recorded from Scott and Seringapatam Reefs and the Rowley Shoals. The fauna is distinct from that of the adjacent continental mainland, and is indicated by the 70 new records for Western Australia. In addition many species rare along the continental coastline are common on the offshore reefs. There is a considerable overlap in the mollusc faunas of the Rowley Shoals and Scott and Seringapatam Reefs. Differences found can be attributed to variations in habitats sampled in the two systems and human influences.

N2  - A series of fish collections from previously unexplored Rowley Shoals and Scott Reef, off north-western Australia, are reported. A preliminary list is provided containing 688 species in 258 genera and 77 families, including 342 new records for Western Australia. Approximately 380 species collected from these oceanic corals reefs have not been found on coastal reefs of Western Australia, although many are present on the Great Barrier Reef. The overall faunal composition is similar to that of other oceanic reef areas in the tropical Indo-West Pacific, with strong affinity to the Indonesian fauna.

N2  - Eighty-three blocks of mangroves were visited in Western Australia from Cambridge Gulf to Shark Bay between 1973 and 1982. The vegetation and substrate at each site are described. Twenty-two species of bird were found to be confined to mangroves or limited to them for at least part of their range in this State: Great-billed Heron (<em>Ardea sumatrana), </em>Mangrove Heron<em> (Butorides striata), </em>Grey Goshawk (<em>Accipiter novaehollandiae</em>), Chestnut Rail (<em>Eulabeornis castaneoventris</em>), Bar-shouldered Dove (<em>Geopelia humeralis</em>), Little Bronze Cuckoo (<em>Chrysococcyx minutillus</em>), Mangrove Kingfisher (<em>Halcyon chloris</em>), Lemon-breasted Flycatcher (<em>Microeca flavigaster</em>), Mangrove Robin (Eopsaltria pulverulenta), Mangrove Golden Whistler (<em>Pachycephala melanura</em>), White-breasted Whistler (<em>Pachycephala lanioides), </em>Wood Fantail (<em>Rhipidura dryas</em>), Mangrove Grey Fantail (<em>Rhipidura phasiana</em>),  Broad-billed Flycatcher (<em>Myiagra ruficollis</em>), Shining Flycatcher (<em>Myiagra alecto</em>), Mangrove Flyeater (<em>Gerygone levigaster</em>), Dusky Flyeater (<em>gerygone tenebrosa</em>), Large-billed Flyeater (<em>Gerygone magnirostris</em>), Yellow White-eye (<em>Zosterops lutea</em>), Red-headed Honeyeater (Myzomela erythrocephala), White-breasted Woodswallow (<em>Artamus leucorynchus</em>), and Black Butcherbird (<em>Cracticus quoyi</em>). For each species, data are given on distribution, status, ecology, voice, food, breeding, colour of unfeathered parts, and for some species notes on geographic variation and taxonomy.

N2  - The ariid catfish of northern New Guinea are reviewed and the genus <em>Arius</em> Valenciennes and subgenus <em>Brustiarius</em> Herre are diagnosed. Three New Guinea species, <em>Hemipimelodus velutinus</em> Weber, <em>H. taylori</em> Roberts and <em>H. macrorhynchus</em> Weber are transferred to <em>Arius</em> Valenciennes, and a replacement name <em>A. robertsi,</em> is proposed for <em>A. taylori,</em> preoccupied. The five northern New Guinea species represented are <em>Arius</em> (<em>Brustiarius</em>) <em>nox</em> Herre, <em>A.(B.) solidus</em> Herre, <em>A. velutinus</em> (Weber) and two new species of <em>Arius</em> Valenciennes. Synonymies and diagnoses are based on examination of types, biological and osteological data, and study of large series of material. <em>Arius utarus </em>sp. nov. is closely related to <em>A. leptaspis</em> (Bleeker) of southern New Guinea. It differs from all other ariids in northern New Guinea by a combination of characters including a broad mouth, rough head shield, long barbels and a palatal dentition consisting of four groups of teeth traversing the front of the palate; and from <em>A. leptaspis</em> by the number of trunk vertebrae, head size, caudal peduncle length and several other relative body parts. <em>A. coatesi</em> sp. nov. attains a large size and is distinguished by several characteristics, particularly its short barbels, small eye and constant palatal dentition of two tooth patches. All species appear to be endemic to the major river basins of northern New Guinea, i.e. the Mamberamo, Idenburg, Sepik and Ramu Rivers. Diagnoses, descriptions, illustrations and some biological data are provided for the new taxa. A dichotomous key to the five species also is given.

N2  - A survey of the freshwater fishes of the Sepik River system of northern Papua New Guinea was undertaken by the authors between 1978 and 1985 with the use of gill nets and rotenone, and also by monitoring catches at local villages and markets. We also include records of past expeditions, namely that of the Dutch naturalist Gjellerup in 1910 and the yacht <em>Illyria</em> in 1929. The total known freshwater fauna as reported herein consists of 57 species in 35 genera and 23 families. The fauna is typical of other sections of New Guinea and northern Australia in that it is dominated by catfishes (Ariidae and Plotosidae), rainbowfishes (Melanotaeniidae), gudgeons (Eleotrididae) and gobies (Gobiidae) which collectively comprise 57 percent of the total species. With the exception of 22 widely distributed species that are frequently estuarine dwellers and are confined to the lower Sepik, the fishes are strongly endemic, either to the Sepik-Ramu drainages (which interconnect during floods), or the "intermontane trough" composed of the combined Markham, Ramu, Sepik, and Mamberamo systems. Individual accounts, including brief descriptions and information pertaining to habitat, distribution and biology are included for each species. In addition illustrations are provided for many of the endemic species.

N2  - Two new species of <em>Gloosogobius </em>are described from the Sepik and Ramu river systems of northern Papua New Guinea. <em>Glossogobius coatesi</em> sp. nov. is known from 30 specimens taken at distances ranging from 380 - 435 km upstream from the sea at elevations between 25 and 125 m. It is characterized by a combination of features which include a low number of second dorsal rays (...), usually (...) anal rays, slightly thickened pelvic fins which are somewhat elongated, 27 vertebrae, and a pattern of five large dark blotches along the middle of the side. <em>Glossogobius torrentis</em> sp. nov. is described from over 200 specimens collected 450 to 680 km upstream at elevations between 200 and 1800 m. It is distinguished by a well developed mental frenum, low second dorsal and anal counts (19 and 17 respectively), a short, rounded and thickened pelvic fin, and black spot at the rear part of the first dorsal fin.

Commonly known as glassfishes because of their semi-transparent appearance when alive, the chandids are inhabitants of fresh and brackish waters of the Indo-West Pacific region. A total of 22 species belonging to four genera are reported from Australia and New Guinea. They are distinguished by various characters including body proportions (particularly maximum depth and the height of the spinous dorsal fin), counts of fin rays, scales, and gill rakers, and the serration pattern of certain head bones.(...)

N2  - This paper is an annotated list of the 379 species and subspecies of birds resident in or visiting the South-west Land Division of Western Australia and the seas over the adjacent continental shelf. It is the most diverse part of the State, the climate varying between arid with hot summers in the far north-east and humid with cool summers in the far southwest. Almost all of the Division lies south of the mulga-eucalypt line and receives most of its rain between late autumn and early spring. Originally the dryland vegetation consisted almost wholly of forests, woodlands and shrublands; there was little grassland before European settlement. With more than 90% of the population this Division is by far the most environmentally disturbed part of Western Australia. The many changes resulting from these disturbances are dealt with in the species accounts.

N2  - The paper provides an overview of the geomorphology and Late Cenozoic geomorphological development of the Cape Range region. The broad scale geomorphology of the region is directly controlled by the structural geology and uplift history. The open anticline which forms the range has been deeply dissected on the flanking margins. The pervasive development of karst terrains and dissolution forms, at a variety of scales, reflect the dominance of carbonate lithologies. A series of emergent reef-complexes are striking elements of the gcomorphology of the western side of the Cape Range. From these, new palaeontological evidence is presented which suggests that uplift in the area is likely to have been a feature of the late Tertiary, and that it did not extend into the Quaternary, as was previously thought. The coastal margin of Cape Range has seen the development of extensive alluvial fans. These interfinger and are associated with a series of marine-nearshore morphostratigraphic units of Middle (?)- Late Quaternary age. Deposits of Last Interglacial age are especially prominent elements of the geomorphology of the coastal margin.

N2  - Cape Range is composed of a sequence of predominantly calcareous sedimentary rocks of Palaeocene-Pliocene age, overlain by Pliocene-Ilolocene alluvial, littoral, and shallow water marine sediments on the coastal plain, which borders the range. It is a gentle anticline resulting from inversion of fault movement on an underlying fault. The uplift has occurred intermittently since the Late Cretaceous and has affected sedimentation. The range emerged as an island probably in the Pliocene and karstification is inferred to have rapidly extended down for about 100 m in karst-prone limestone and gradually extended laterally as the range emerged. During the lowsLand of sea level in the Pleistoeene the karstifieation is presumed to have extended further offshore and been accompanied by deep erosion and establishment of the present-day drainage system. The present regional water table occurs below the level of karstification in the central part of the range and witllin cavernous limestone around its margin. The groundwater is believed to occur as a lens of fresh groundwater overlying seawater as on some oceanic islands. The remnant cave syslcm in the central part of the range is inferred to have provided a relatively stable habitat for a diverse subaerial cave fauna since the Pliocene, whereas water-filled cave system on the coastal plain, which is the habitat of aquatic troglobites, has probably extended and been subject to marked variation in the hydrogeological regime as the range has risen, and in response to ehanges in climate and sea level.

N2  - -The paper provides a tentative outline of the Late Cenozoic climate history of the Cape Range region. Given the sparsity of information specific to the region, a model of palaeoclimatic events is developed based on a wider understanding of the nature and controls of palaeoclimatic events in northern Australia. From the available evidence, it seems that the wetter conditions which prevailed in this area during much of the Tertiary were replaced in the closing stages of the Tertiary by a drier climate regime. The recent climate regime of the region is likely to have been in existence since the Middle Pleistocene. The general Middle - Late Quaternary climate regimes are likely to have oscillated between long, dry glacial stages, lasting for some 100 000 years, and shorter, wet interglacial stages, which lasted for some 10 000 years. There are suggestions that some Pleistocene interglacials were wetter than the Holocene but this is difficult to demonstrate.

The Cape is dominated by a series of limestone hills of moderate to low relief, surrounded by sandplain or coastal plains. The Cape Range itself is vegetated with <em>Eucalyptus</em> over <em>Triodia</em> , with <em>Acacia- Cassia</em> shrubs as understory or locally dominant. The lower ranges are vegetated with <em>Acacia</em> shrublands over <em>Triodia</em>. The coastal plain is vegetated with grasslands, coastal strand vegetation, low shrublands (including Samphires and Saltbush) and Mangrove low forest and the sandplain by heath over <em>Triodia</em>.

All seven elements are macrofaunal and exhibit troglobitic morphology. Meiofaunal elements (protists, turbellarians, nematodes, oligochaetes, copepods, and acarines) are cited. The gastropod <em>Iravadia</em> sp. is recognized as possibly a marine stygophile.

N2  - The terrestrial cavernicolous fauna of Cape Range is dominated by a wide array of arachnids and myriapods, of which 64 species have been collected from the caves or their entrances. Sixteen species are fully troglobitic (two schizomids, two pseudoscorpions, one harvestman, seven spiders, four millipedes), while others show either partial modification for cave existence, or are unmodified representatives of the surface fauna that opportunistically occur in the caves. The hiogeographic affinities of at least five of these species is found to be tropical Australia, with at least one maintaining links with an ancient Gondwanan fauna presently found in northwestern Australia, India, and southern Africa (including Madagascar). Another distinct component of the cavernicolous fauna is derived from southern Australia The significance of the Cape Range troglobitic arachnid and myriapod fauna is highlighted by comparisons between the faunae in three other Australian karst systems (Nullarbor Plain, Chillagoe, and Tasmania) in which the richness of the Cape Range fauna is exceeded only by the Tasmanian region, which contains twice as many troglobites but which includes over 60 karst regions. Complete knowledge of the cavernicolous fauna is hampered by lack of taxonomic expertise and, in some cases, lack of sufficient specimeus.

The allozyme data are used to assess patterns of genetic diversity within and amongst a troglophilic philosciid isopod, <em>Laevophiloscia yalgoonensis</em>, and five troglobitic groups, the schizomid <em>Draculoides vinei</em>, the paradoxosomatid millipedes <em>Stygiochiropus</em> spp., an undescribed genus of melitid amphipod, <em>Stygiocaris</em> spp. shrimps, and the blind gudgeon <em>Milyeringa</em> <em>veritas</em>. The implications of the data for species delineation, the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships, the estimation of times of divergence, and various aspects of intraspecific diversity are discussed in some detail.

N2  - Cape Range peninsula contains a diverse troglobite (obligatory cave inhabitants) fauna, the only rich troglobite community known in Western Australia and in the semi-arid tropics. At least thirtyeight species of troglobite (or stygobiont) in this sparsely sampled area place it amongst the worlds faunistically diverse karst areas. The characteristics of the region and its subterranean fauna are broadly examined in this paper.

N2  - Archaeological research on Cape Range peninsula has provided the earliest unequivocal evidence for the use of coastal resources by Pleistocene Australians. Mandu Mandu Creek rockshelter, a small limestone cave in the western foothills of Cape Range is currently the oldest reliably dated archaeological site in northern Western Australia. Excavations in this site, and in two other rockshelters in Cape Range, firmly establish that coastal resources have been an integral part of Aboriginal subsistence strategies in this region for over 30,000 years. The archaeological record from midden sites near the modern shoreline provides important evidence for the presence and subsequent decline during the middle Holocene of a more diversified intertidal environment than exists today on this semi-arid stretch of the Western Australian coast.

N2  - Twenty-three locations were surveycd along Western Australia's west and south coasts during thc period 1976-1993. This produced a total of 728 specics of reef fishes, of which 491 specics were tropical (67% of the total), 174 species warm-temperate (24%), and 36 species subtropical (5%) the remaining 27 species (4%) have uncertain distributions. Tropical fish numbers were highest in the Ningaloo Reef area at the northern end of the study area, the fauna reducing southwards to Rottnest Island, where it was nevertheless still prominent. The warm-temperate component was most numerous along the south and lower west coasts, its numbers reducing northwards to Shark Bay. Within the overlap zone of these two faunas, the subtropical fauna was at its strongest.

N2  - One scaphopod and 35 gastropod species are recorded from the Late Maastrichtian Miria Formation of the Carnarvon Basin, northwestern Australia. Preservation of the fossils suggests that the assemblage, which is inferred to contain herbivores, possible detrital feeders, graz.ers, predatory and ectoparasitic carnivores, is only partly representative of the original fauna. The original mineralogy of the shells has, in part, determined which mollusks have been preserved, their state at recovery, and whether or not they can be identified. Primary calcite has remained but argonite has been lost and partially replaced by secondary calcite. Six species are known only from internal moulds,

N2  - A survey of the Cenozoic fossil fauna of Barrow Island, northwest Australia, has yielded a rich fauna of Middle Miocene and Late Pleistocene molluscs, and a rich Middle Miocene echinoid fauna. This paper, in recording 179 species, represents the first documentation of the fossil fauna of Barrow Island. The Miocene limestones reach up to 29 m in thickness in cliff sections exposed on the western side of the island. On the eastern side they are up to 9 m thick and are overlain by Late Pleistocene limestones. Formerly considered to belong to the Trealla Limestone, the Miocene limestones are regarded as a distinct formation, herein termed the "Poivre Formation", on account of their more variable and generally coarser sediment grain size.

N2  - The duration of copulation in spiders varies both-within and between species, and in the latter by several orders of magnitude. The sources of this variation are explored in comparative analyses of the duration of copulation and other life-history variables of 135 species of spiders from 26 families. The duration of copulation is correlated with body size within several species, but the pattern is not consistent and more generally there is no inter-specific covariation between these variables. The duration of copulation within orb-weaving spiders is associated with both the location of mating and the frequency of sexual cannibalism, suggesting that the length of copulation is limited by the risk of predation. Finally, entelegyne spiders copulate for longer than haplogyne spiders, a pattern that can be interpreted in terms of male mating strategies or the complexity of their copulatory apparatus.

N2  - Aspects of the biogeographical history and behavioural ecology of the Australian <em>Latrodectus hasseIti</em> provide support for the endemic status of this species. Cannibalism, prey stealing and short instar lengths are growth strategies for female spiders whereas early maturation, small size, hiding and scavenging are useful survival tactics for males. Moreover male complicity is an important component of sexual cannibalism which is shown to be a highly predictable event. <em>Latrodectus hasseIti</em> males hybridize with female <em>L. katipo</em> (a New Zealand species) and fertile Fl and F2 generations imply genetic relatedness. Hence, it is likely that <em>L. hasselti</em> and <em>L. katipo </em>evolved from a common ancestor in ancient Pangaea, a feasible explanation only if <em>L. hasseIti</em> is endemic to Australia. It is concluded that<em> L. hasseIti</em> would have been able to persist in outback Australia for millions of years, with its intraspecific predatory habits aiding subsistence and the evolution of sexual cannibalism providing a way of coping with infrequent meeting and mating opportunities.

N2  - The number of social spider species in Australasia may be as few as three, or as many as there are species of spiders, given the present lack of concensus on the definition of a social animal. This is part of the reason why a unified theory of sociobiology has been elusive, and is especially regrettable for arachnologists because spiders are unusually promising subjects for testing theoretical ideas about social behaviour. A review of these problems, with special reference to Australasian social spiders, argues that cooperation among mutually tolerant individuals, in behaviour other than courtship, mating and parental care, is the sole defining criterion of sociality.

N2  - Attempts to conserve invertebrates face many conceptual and practical problems. Spiders are one group of invertebrates with an undeserved bad public image, and it could be thought that any attempt to promote spider conservation in Australia would be seen as a waste of time and effort. The utilitarian values of and the threats to spiders are summarised. It is argued that spiders have one advantage over most over groups of invertebrates: they are well known, although not well appreciated, by most of the populace. It is suggested that spider conservation in Australia is at a stage where programmes emphasising the positive benefits of spiders may result in a more sympathetic attitude towards spiders.

N2  - Mites, the most diverse taxon in the Arachnida, are a major component of the rainforest canopy fauna. Twenty-nine species of mites were identified from the outermost canopy (leaves and their subtending stems) of a single rose marara tree (<em>Pseudoweinmannia lachnocarpa</em>) growing in subtropical rainforest in south-eastern Queensland. None of these species were found in suspended soils collected from a treehole and the root mats of two epiphytic ferns on the same tree, although 21 other mite species lived in the soils. Forty-seven leaves and 290 cm of small stems from brown beech trees (<em>Pennantia cunninghamii)</em> at two subtropical rainforest sites 110 km apart contained 1615 mites representing 43 species. The average brown beech leaf contained three times as many species as the average rose marara leaf. Most mites collected from brown beech leaves were found within domatia, structures lacking on rose marara leaves. When domatia were blocked, average species number per leaf was reduced to half that on leaves with open domatia. Only four mite species were common to both sites, and only five species were found on both rose marara and brown beech, suggesting that a very diverse fauna awaits discovery.

N2  - The distribution of 12 species of scorpions overlap that of the Western Australian wheatbelt, for five species the overlap is only marginal. In the south-west, species richness increases from two on the lower south coast to seven in the central wheatbelt before declining slightly further north. Species richness data from 7 districts indicated that with adequate sampling rIchness could be calculated from distribution maps. At the level of remnant, richness varied from two to six, with a significant correlation between area and species richness. In small areas (0.05 to 2.4 ha) within a remnant, area and number of trap nights were not significantly correlated with species richness, but the number of microhabitats did show a significant positive correlation. Detailed habitat data was only available for the KeIlerberrin district. <em>Lychas alexandrinus </em>and <em>Isometroides vescus</em> were habitat generalists, whereas <em>Cercophonius michaelseni</em> and <em>Urodacus armatus</em> while using a variety of vegetation associations were dependent on microhabitat and soil type respectively. <em>L. marmoreus</em> and <em>U. novaehollandiae</em> were recorded too infrequently to assess habitat requirements. Data from this area suggested that all species can survive in small isolated remnants as small as 0.05 to 2 ha. However intensive grazing can lead to local extinction in remnants up to 7 ha. All species can survive fire, however, for<em> C. michaelseni</em> destruction of microhabitat eventually leads to local extinction.

A cladistic analysis of generic relationships is presented and two new subfamily groupings are recognised. These are the Filistatinae (<em>Filistata, Kukulcania, Sahastata</em> and, provisionally, <em>Zaituna</em>), and the Prithinae, subfam. nov. (<em>Pritha, Wandella, Yardiella, Andoharano, Afrofilistata, Pikelinia, Filistatoides, Filistatinella)</em>. The taxonomic validity of the prithine genera Malalistata and Tricalanws are questioned. The affinities of the enigmatic central Asian genus Microfilistata remain obscure.

N2  - The chorion surface features of the eggs of various orders and suborders of chelicerates are compared. Eggs of the suborder Mesothelae have spheres coating the chorion surface as found in the other Araneae suborders. Hence, all Araneae eggs examined have had a surface coating of spheres. Some Ricinulei eggs are coated with spheres comparable to those found in the Araneae but they are not sister groups. No other chelicerate eggs examined have surfaces coated with spheres comparable to those found in the Araneae. These include the Schizomida, Pseudoscorpionida, Uropygi, Amblypygi, Opiliones, Acari, Xiphosura and Pycnogonida. These other orders have different features on the egg surface ranging from a lack of ornamentation, through sculptured surfaces, to honeycomb structures or fibrous networks. The presence of a layer of spheres on a ricinuleid egg similar to those found on the eggs of spiders needs confirmation as there is a chance that a spider's egg was being carried by the ricinuleid when it was collected.

Since the first description in 1985, two more complete specimens have been found, and are described herein. They are of particular significance in that they have been etched from limestone and are virtually undistorted. As a result they provide detailed information on the anatomy of the Osteolepiformes previously available only from interpretations of ground sections, and from etched specimens of the genus <em>Cladarosymblema</em>, which comes from the much later Early Carboniferous (Visean) of Queensland, and <em>Medoevia</em>, which comes from an unknown, probably Late Devonian, locality in Russia. Particular items of significance are the notch in the anterior end of the maxilla defining the posterior margin of the choana; the absence of prenasal fossae; the very high crista suspendens; the foramen for the ophthalmica magna situated at the anterior edge of the basisphenoid process; the pair of large rounded processes at the edge of the fossa Bridgei; the proximal part of the hyomandibular is horizontal; the basibranchial/basihyal is short, broad and flat, making a single unit; and the posterior edge of the palatoquadrate making a high arch.

N2  - The work is a taxonomic treatment of a number of closely related groups of gorgonians within the family Isididae (Octocorallia: Coelenterata). The revisionary aspects of the study are centred around the genus <em>Mopsea</em> which is shown to be grossly paraphyletic. Heretofore including 17 nominal species, it is proposed that only the type species<em> Mopsea encrinula</em> is valid; a second, new species is added. Of the other recognised species, <em>Mopsea dichotoma</em> (Linne) is an unidentifiable melithaeid, and the remainder are divided amongst 1 existing and 7 new genera. These re-assignments are primarily on the basis of polyp structure, colonial branching pattern, and axial architecture, which are correlated with sclerite form and arrangement. Various states of these characters are used to define the relatedness of other genera. Taxonomic confusion is most likely to arise amongst both unbranched forms and branched forms which are predominantly planar, so the species of all known closely related genera with these morphologies are revised. The latter comprises the recognised and valid genera <em>Acanthoisis</em>, <em>Peltastisis</em>, <em>Circinisis</em>, <em>Minuisis</em> and the neglected <em>Notisis</em>. Although <em>Minuisis</em> has a generally bushy habitus, it is included because its growth form is modified to pinnate, planar branching by a commensal scale worm. It is shown that <em>Primnoisis</em>, <em>Chathamisis</em>, and <em>Echinisis</em> which have a bushy growth form can be distinguished as a group on this character, and individually using polyp structure; and these taxa are only considered at the generic level. Descriptions are extensively illustrated with scanning electron micrographs and all preparation techniques are detailed.

N2  - A total of 410 sites in the major watersheds in the south-western corner of Australia, bounded by Bunbury in the north-west and just east of Albany in the south-east, were sampled for fish. Sampling of the different sites was carried out using one or more of the following methods, namely seine netting, scoop netting, trapping and electrofishing to catch juvenile and adult fish, and light trapping, scoop netting and haul netting to collect larval fish. The fish caught at each site were identified and the number of each species recorded. These data were then collated, both with those derived from the studies of Christensen (1982) and Jaensch (1992) and with the records of the Western Australian Museum (WAM), to elucidate the distributions of each of the fish species found in freshwater in south-western Australia. The eight species endemic to south-western Australia are <em>Tandanus bostocki, Lepidogalaxias salamandroides, Galaxias occidentalis, Galaxiella nigrostriata, Galaxiella munda, Bostockia porosa, Edelia vittata </em>and<em> Nannatherina balstoni</em>. The other species found in this region include <em>Galaxias truttaceus</em> and <em>Galaxias maculatus</em>, which are also represented in south-eastern mainland Australia and Tasmania, the anadromous lamprey <em>Geotria australis</em>, and those teleosts which are commonly found in freshwater, but belong to predominantly marine families, i.e. <em>Leptatherina wallacei, Pseudogobius olorum</em> and <em>Afurcagobius suppositus</em>. Finally, there are those species that have been introduced into the region, i.e. <em>Oncorhynchus mykiss, Salmo trutta, Gambusia holbrooki</em> and <em>Perca fluviatilis.</em>

N2  - The oldest articulated teleostome (?acanthodian) fish yet found in Australia, <em>Yealepis douglasi </em>gen. et sp. nov., is described from Yea in central Victoria. The specimen was associated with the Lower <em>Baragwanathia</em> Plant Assemblage in the Late Silurian (Ludlow) Yea Formation. The middle part of the body squamation is well preserved in part and counterpart, showing pectoral, pelvic and anal fins. The normal body scales are square-crowned, 0.8 to 1.5 mm wide, with a base wider than the crown. The crown bears short radial ridges along the anterior margin, and several vertical and / or radial ridges along the posterolateral sides. The only overlapping scales are the small, elongated scales near the distal margins of the fin webs. Dermal shoulder girdle plates, and fin and intermediate spines, are absent. The noncaudal fin webs do not bear the spines along the leading edges which are diagnostic for acanthodian fishes. This new genus is assigned to the Teleostomi, and provisionally to the Acanthodii, based on the type of scale and squamation pattern. Order and family are indeterminate, as it also lacks diagnostic characters for the recognized acanthodian orders. Alternatively, the new genus could represent a stem-group teleostome.

N2  - Microvertebrates obtained from measured stratigraphic sections near Buchan in northeastern Victoria and Taemas in southern New South Wales have been dated as <em>dehiscens</em> and <em>perbonus</em> conodont zones (early Emsian). The two microvertebrate faunas are similar; the areas are separated by only about 300 km and were both shallow marine environments during the Early Devonian. Thelodonts are a rare component in the otherwise abundant microvertebrate fauna recovered from four sections containing almost 450 samples; 18 turiniid scales have been found. It is considered likely that only one species of turiniid is represented. Trunk and transitional scales share similarites with scales of at least five species of turiniids from eastern Gondwana, recovered from the Aztec Siltstone in Antarctica, the Cravens Peak Beds in western Queensland, the Officer Basin in South Australia and the Silverband Formation in western Victoria. Some head scales show a previously undescribed crown morphology of sharply incised, parallel-sided notches separating wide radiating ribs. The scales are referred to <em>Turinia</em> sp. cf. <em>T. australiensis.</em>

N2  - A new primitive coelacanth <em>Gavinia syntrips</em> gen. et sp. nov., is described from the upper Middle Devonian Mt Howitt site, central Victoria. The genus is based on a partial skull, complete caudal fin and distal section of trunk and median fins, some isolated scales, and indeterminate remains. It is regarded as the most primitive member of the Coelacanthiformes because it has a very long dentary bone, approximately 36% of the lower jaw length, a relatively elongate cheek region, and coarsely omamented scales. It retains the basic coelacanthiform synapomorphies of having a tandem double lower jaw joint; broad-headed, short hyomandibular; large, deep operculum; and a rostra I organ denoted by the large pore system in the snout bones. Isolated coelacanth remains from the Pambula River site, New South Wales, are also referred to <em>Gavinia</em> sp. indet. A provisional phylogenetic analysis places <em>Gavinia</em> as the plesiomorphic sister taxon to all other Coelacanthiformes (Actinistia), and this suggests a possible origin for the clade in eastern Gondwana.

A preliminary phylogenetic analysis considers three possible positions for the new species in a previously published cladogram for species of Bothriolepis. A close relationship to several Antarctic species is suggested. Correlation between southeastern Australia and the Aztec sequence of Antarctica is discussed. The Aztec sequence may be younger than previously proposed.

N2  - The ontogenetic trajectories of dermal plates of the arthrodiran placoderrns <em>Compagopiscis croucheri </em>and <em>lncisoscutum</em> <em>ritchiei</em> from the Late Devonian Gogo Formation, Canning Basin, Western Australia were compared to assess the impact of heterochrony. Most characters showed peramorphosis. Allometric predisplacement occurred in: the biting division of the inferognathal; the anterior ventrolateral; and the median dorsal plate's breadth. Allometric hypermorphosis was seen in the increases of the prepineal length of the skull roof and the median dorsal plate length. Peramorphic traits contributed to a trend of skull elongation. Fewer paedomorphic features were found. Allometric postdisplacement that resulted in paedomorphosis occurred in the postmesial breadth and the orbital diameter of the skull roof. It is suggested that lengthwise growth occurs earlier in ontogeny than breadthways growth, and that dissociated heterochrony was an important mechanism in the evolution of these arthrodires.

N2  - Re-mapping during 1994-96 of the Upper Devonian on the Parkes and Grenfell 1:100,000 map sheets was the first systematic field examination of this area by an experienced vertebrate palaeontologist. This resulted in the discovery of some 40 new fossil localities (mostly fish) at various horizons within the Hervey Group. Two new fish occurrences, in sediments associated with the underlying Dulladerry Volcanics, require an age revision from Early to late Middle Devonian for the termination of Devonian volcanism in central New South Wales. The age of the Canowindra fossil fish fauna is uncertain, but may be as old as late Frasnian, rather than Famennian as was previously assumed. Correlations across the Lachlan River are clarified, and a new locality for the sinolepid antiarch <em>Grenfellaspis</em> is reported from near the top of the Bumberry Formation. A fish fauna from higher in the sequence includes an antiarch with an armour 1-2 m long, of comparable size to similar material from South China, which supports a latest Devonian Asian connection with East Gondwana. Preliminary analysis of faunal content is used to propose a provisional succession of six faunal zones, to improve the resolution on the Late Devonian part of the macrovertebrate zonation for East Gondwana.

Based on a single, fairly complete specimen, it is distinctive in its a single dorsal fin braced by a large, stout spine with numerous ribs and posterior denticles, apparently no second dorsal or anal fin, an amphistylic jaw suspension, and a distinctive triangular palatoquadrate. It is suggested that the species may represent a high-latitude, Late Devonian relict taxon.

N2  - South African fossil fish remains spanning much of the Devonian Period have now been reported from the Bokkeveld and Witteberg Groups (West Gondwana). Emsian and Eifelian material is scarce, consisting of fragments of an antiarch, elasmobranchs, the acanthodian <em>Machaeracanthus</em> and a possible dipnoan, represented by a single scale. Recent explorations have focused on Middle Devonian (Givetian) and Late Devonian (Famennian) sites in the south and west of the country. The Givetian ichthyofauna is characterized by a high proportion of sharks to placoderrns and an absence of agnathans, actinopterygians and dipnoans, with only a single crossopterygian (<em>Onychodus</em> sp.).

N2  - Reinvestigation of the snout of the Lower Carboniferous rhizodont fish <em>Barameda decipiens</em>, together with observations on an isolated premaxilla of <em>Strepsodus sauroides</em> from Scotland and a new Devonian rhizodont from Canowindra, Australia, reveals that the rhizodontid snout had only one pair of nostrils rather than two as previously suggested. There are distinct lateral rostraI and tectaI bones surrounding the external naris. The palate of <em>Barameda</em> also shows evidence of a choana being present. The protrusion of the lower jaws in <em>Barameda</em>, previously interpreted as an artefact of preservation, is matched in the three-dimensional Canowindra material and appears to be a real morphological feature. These data permit a new reconstruction of the head of <em>Barameda</em>.

N2  - The Permian (Artinskian) Whitehill Formation (Ecca Group) in South Africa and southern Namibia was deposited as part of a large stratified inland sea which extended from the southern margins of South Africa, and southern Namibia, northern Namibia (Aba-Huab Formation, Huab Basin) to the Iratl Formation of the Parana Basin in Brazil and parts of Uruguay. A common biota exists between these two continents, namely mesosaurid reptiles, pygocephalomorph crustacea, wood, palaeoniscoid fish and insects. The Whitehill Formation also contains plant stem fragments, palynomorphs, coprolites, a cephalochordate, rare sponge spicules and traces of arthropods and fish. The good preservation, particularly of the palaeoniscoid material, from the Whitehill Formation contrasts strongly with the disarticulated scales and spines from northern Namibia and Brazil. Recent collections in the Whitehill Formation near Calvinia and Louriesfontein (Northern Cape Province) of South Africa have demonstrated the necessity for a review of the palaeoniscoid taxa present in these units. Possible new species have also been collected, including a deep-bodied form.

N2  - The holotype and only known specimen of the prosauropod <em>Agrosaurus macgillivrayi</em> Seeley, 1891 probably comes from the Late Triassic Durdham Down locality near Bristol, England. Originally it was reported as being from the northeast coast of Australia. Firsthand examination of the most plausible northeast Australian source for such a fossil, outcrops of the Jurassic Helby Beds exposed on the east coast of Cape York Peninsula, have demonstrated that the rock in that unit was quite unlike that associated with the holotype. Gross and trace element comparisons between possible fossil bone fragments from the Helby Beds and the holotype also showed them to be quite different. On the other hand, similar comparisons between the holotype and fossil bone from Durdham Down showed them to be quite comparable, as were the rocks and microvertebrates there and the ones associated with the holotype. Furthermore, <em>A. macgillivrayi </em>is probably a junior synonym of <em>Thecodontosaurus antiquus</em> Morris, 1843 from Durdham Down.

N2  - A brief review of recent research into Australasian sauropterygians is given. The earliest record is an Anisian pachypleurosaur from South Island, New Zealand. An Early Jurassic record from Queensland, hitherto included in the Plesiosauria is shown to be the last known pachypleurosaur. A diverse record of Pliosauroidea is known from the time of the break-up of East Gondwana, in marginal rift sediments of Western Australia and South Australia, dated to the earliest Cretaceous. The record of the marine incursion into the Eromanga Basin, Queensland, contains Albian-age pliosaurs and elasmosaurs. The New Zealand plesiosaurian record contains mostly members of the 'long-necked' Plesiosauroidea, all from the Haumurian stage of the Campanian-Maastrichtian. One specimen represents a unique record of a cryptoclidid in Australasia, more closely related to the European Callovian <em>Cryptoclidus</em> than to the other late cryptoclidids known from South America and the Antarctic Peninsula.

N2  - Both climate and tectonics have been demonstrated to be prominent factors in the formation of the sedimentological record. By extension, these factors must have been influential in the preservation of the vertebrate fossil record. The Late Cretaceous Foreland Basin of the Rocky Mountain region in North America is a rich source of vertebrate fossil remains and is ideally situated to investigate this issue. A sample of 185 published and unpublished vertebrate localities has been examined to determine the relative influence of regional tectonism versus climate in the formation of this fossil record.

N2  - The Early Eocene Tingamarra Local Fauna, from near Murgon, Boat Mountain, southeastern Queensland, has produced an array of important vertebrate fossils, including two, possibly three, taxa of nonpasserine birds. The fossils described here are comparable with what have been termed the 'transitional' Charadriiformes, for which the 'form family' Graculavidae has been recognized. The post-cranial skeletal morphology of these birds is shared by early members of the Anseriformes, causing uncertainty over the correct ordinal allocation of taxa in the absence of the distinctive anseriform skull. As a conservative approach, the Murgon specimens are allocated to the Graculavidae in the Charadriiformes, pending the discovery of informative cranial elements. Because both the Graculavidae and early anseriforms are largely restricted to the period of the Late Cretaceous through Early Eocene, the occurrence of these fossils at Murgon is consistent with the date obtained from radiometric and other faunistic sources.

A new species, <em>Ektopodon litolophus</em>, described on the basis of an M1 from the Leaf Locality, Lake Ngapakaldi, Lake Eyre Basin, is characterized by the extremely simple structure of the crests. Ektopodontids are recorded for the first time from the northern half of the Australian continent through discovery of a tooth fragment at Wayne's Wok Site, Riversleigh World Heritage area, northwestern Queensland. Comparisons of M1 of <em>Chunia</em> and <em>Ektopodon</em> species now allow evolutionary trends of simplification to be discerned.

Approximately six <em>Micronomus</em> species are today widely distributed across the Australian mainland, Papua New Guinea and Ambon, and are found in most habitat types from desert to rainforest. The discovery of an indeterminate species of <em>Micronomus</em> in the Chinchilla Local Fauna does not contradict the palaeoenvironmental interpretation of the area as woodland savannah.

N2  - Environmental changes during the Quaternary in eastern Asia had profound impacts on the distributions of mammals. Critical for many taxa were the southward latitudinal shifts of the tropical and subtropical zones, and decreases in the areal extents of these zones. In this study, a geographic information system (GIS) has been used to examine the spatial responses of mammalian genera to environmental changes of the Pleistocene of China. Conditions of increasing seasonality during the Pleistocene favoured the evolution of large and well-insulated morphs in several mammalian families (e.g., Rhinocerotidae, Tapindae, Elephantidae), but this strategy was not successful (in terms of long-term survival) in many cases.

N2  - <em>Borungaboodie</em> <em>hatcheri</em> gen. et sp. nov., a very large potoroine kangaroo, is described from a dentary collected from a Pleistocene deposit in a cave near Witchcliffe in southwestern Australia. It is clearly distinguished from all other potoroines on the basis of several unique morphological features of the dentary and dentition, as well as its larger size. <em>Borugaboodie</em> may represent the least derived member of a lineage containing <em>Caloprymnus</em>, <em>Milliyowi</em> and <em>Aepyprymnus</em>. The dentary of <em>B. hatcheri </em>seems to have been capable of generating proportionally larger bite forces than modern bettongs, suggesting a more resistant diet. Its larger body size may also have facilitated a higher degree of opportunistic omnivory than in any modern potoroine. While its ancestral stock may well have inhabited the Miocene wet forest of the southwest, <em>B. hatcheri i</em>tself was probably adapted to a sclerophyll habitat.

At least nine mammal species are recorded from the Bird's Head for the first time; two of these are described as new and three others are almost certainly extinct on the Bird's Head. The new species are a diminutive striped possum, genus <em>Dactylopsila</em>, and an unusual ringtail possum with no close relatives among extant New Guinean pseudocheirids; the latter species is allocated with considerable reservation to the genus <em>Petauroides</em>, which otherwise includes only the Australian Greater Glider, <em>P. volans</em>. An apparently new species of <em>Pogonomelomys</em> is left unnamed pending wider revision of this group.

N2  - A trilobite from an olistolithic slab of Ordovician shallow water limestone in the Big Stockyard Creek area south of Greenvale in the Broken River Province, northeastern Australia, is a new representative of the subfamily Asaphinae: <em>Norasaphus</em> (<em>Shergoldina</em>) <em>greenvalensis</em> subgen. nov. and sp. nov. Due to close morphological relation to previously described Norasaphus from the Nora Formation of central Australia, a late Early Ordovician age is inferred for the trilobite-bearing horizon-the first record of Early Ordovician shelly faunas from northeastern Australia. The agespectrum of Ordovician-Silurian carbonate olistoliths and clasts in debris flows of the Broken River region is increased by the recognition of a late Early Ordovician age for the host olistolith. The "lost" Georgetown Block carbonate platform is now inferred from this occurrence to have been in existence through much or all of the time-interval from late Early Ordovician until at least earliest Wenlock times. Autochthonous and allochthonous carbonate units in the southwestern Broken River Province (west of the Grey Creek Fault Zone) confirm that a carbonate platform (or platforms) persisted, intermittently, in the Broken River Province/Georgetown Province until at least two-thirds of the way through Devonian times, until around the Givetian-Frasnian boundary.

N2  - The Broken River Group in northeastern Queensland has produced the first Middle Devonian trilobites from Australia. With the exception of an undetermined phacopid from Emsian shales, all faunas were recovered from earliest Eifelian through Givetian to ?earliest Frasnian shallow water bioclastic limestones and marlstones. The specifically determinable part of the material consists entirely of five new taxa: <em>Proetus</em> (<em>Devonoproetus</em>) <em>sparsinodosus</em> (Eifelian), <em>Proetus</em> (<em>Devonoproetus</em>) <em>latimargo</em> (Eifelian), <em>Burgesina</em> <em>mawsonae</em> (Eifelian), <em>Scutellum</em> <em>tenuistriatum</em> (Givetian) and <em>Phacops</em> (<em>Phacops</em>) <em>brocki</em> (Givetian) A new genus of proetine, <em>Burgesina</em>, with type species <em>B. mawsonae</em> n. sp. is proposed. Preliminary palaeogeographical comparisons suggest only weak linkages with typical North Gondwanan faunas from Bohemia, southwestern Europe and North Africa. By contrast, the trilobites from the Broken River region are closely related to faunas from Inner Mongolia.

Several blocks from one locality are richly fossiliferous and yielded a fauna of 1024 Late Ordovician conodonts. The fauna includes <em>Belodina confluens</em>, <em>Phragmodus undatus</em>, <em>Yaoxianognathus</em> sp. cf. <em>Y. ani,</em> <em>Y. trunguskaensis</em> and <em>Drepanoistodus</em> <em>suberectus</em>, indicating an Eastonian age. Similar faunas are known from the olistostromal Wisemans Arm Formation and are characteristic of the Late Ordovician "Australasian Faunal Province".

N2  - Stratigraphy and conodont biostratigraphy of the Graveyard Creek Group, particularly the Jack Formation, near the Broken River Crossing, northwest of Charters Towers, are described. A minor lenticular limestone within pelitic lithologies near the Crossing, yielded a late Llandovery C5 fauna, consistent with evidence from graptolites. Diagnostic conodonts were obtained from two limestone units in the overlying Jack Formation. The lowest 72 m of the lower of these units is referred to the Ludlow (but not latest Ludlow) <em>ploeckensis</em> and <em>siluricus</em> zones, and correlates broadly with the interval Silverdale Formation to lower Hume Limestone of the Yass Basin, southeastern Australia. The upper unit yielded <em>Icriodus</em> <em>woschmidti</em> <em>hesperius</em> from two localities, which indicates a latest Pridoli-early Lochkov age and provides the possibility of recognising the Silurian-Devonian boundary within the sequence.

The chitinozoan species <em>Bulbochitina</em> <em>bulbosa</em> Paris, which has been used as an index species for the late Pragian by Paris <em>et al</em>. (1999) in their global biozonation of the Devonian, occurs in the middle part of the Point Hibbs Formation. Previous studies have shown that the oldest <em>B. bulbosa </em>occurs low in the <em>kindlei</em> Conodont Zone, and the presence of this species suggests that the middle and upper part of the Point Hibbs Formation belong to the <em>kindlei</em> Conodont Zone or higher. Chitinozoan species recovered from Tasmania include those with representatives in western France, Bohemia, Poland, Victoria and northern Queensland.

N2  - In order to refine the chronologic framework for the Chah-Riseh area, north-east of Isfahan, limestone samples were collected from a section measured through the most continuous outcrop of limestone thought to span the youngest Late Devonian and/or Early Carboniferous time interval, through an apparent erosional interval into a substantial sequence of dolomitised carbonate. A small Late Devonian (Early <em>expansa</em> Zone) conodont fauna was recovered from the lower half of the section. Above the conodontbearing horizons a red shale and quartz arenite horizon indicative of an erosional interval proved to be unfossiliferous. Above that again, the sequence of dolomitised carbonates is dated as Early Permian on the basis of their fauna of foraminifers. The hiatus between the lower limestone and the upper dolomitised limestones encompasses latest Famennian, the entire Carboniferous and possibly the earliest Permian horizons. Based on chronology and lithology, the lower limestone is referred to the Shishtu Formation, and the upper dolomitised carbonates to the Jamal Formation.

This study surveys previous and current work done on the biostratigraphy of micro and macro vertebrates from ten localities. These localities are: Soh limestone beds, north of Esfahan (<em>hemiansatus</em> to Early and Middle <em>varcus</em> Zones); Ab-e-Morad, Chanaruh (Bidou), Hutk and Tangile-ab-Garm (Ravar) localities in Kerman Province (Early <em>varcus</em> Zone to Early Frasnian); Chahriseh area of northeastern Esfahan (probably Late Givetian or Early Frasnian, <em>jamieae</em>, <em>crepida</em> to <em>rhomboidea</em> and <em>postera</em> to <em>expansa</em> Zones); Howz-e-Dorah and Niaz sections at the Shotori Range, Tabas region (<em>falsiovalis</em>, <em>linguiformis</em>, <em>crepida</em>, <em>expansa</em> to Middle <em>praesulcata</em> Zones); and the Garigoon Mountains in the Dalmeh area, northeastern Ardekan (<em>triangularis</em> to <em>crepida</em> and <em>postera</em> to Early <em>expansa</em> Zones).

Previous interpretations where the Guneyyaka Formation begins in the Late Silurian and represents continuous deposition through to the Middle Devonian, are not confirmed. An earliest Devonian transgression post-dating a pronounced Silurian-Devonian boundary hiatus is also recorded in the Tahtalidag Nappe. There is little thermal alteration of sediments deposited in the Karaburun-Boikardag Ocean on the Perigondwanan shelf to the south during the Caledonian time interval.

N2  - A rich conodont fauna of the <em>Pterospathodus eopennatus</em> Zone (lower Telychian), the oldest Silurian fauna from the southern Taurides, was recovered from the middle Sapandere Formation of the upper Antalya Nappe at Kemer, western Taurides, Turkey. It is similar to European warm-water conodont faunas of the same age. This suggests the formation was initiated by a pre-Telychian (?Aeronian) transgression. The Ashgill of the same area contains Perigondwana cold-water fossils, whereas early Llandovery glaciomarine deposits to the southeast contain exotic dropstones, such as micaschists and orthogneisses. The warming after the end Ordovician-earliest Silurian glaciation caused a rapid global sea-level rise resulting in deposition of black shales during the Aeronian, followed by a drop in sea-level in the late Telychian of southern Turkey.

N2  - A total of 34 Late Devonian brachiopod genera from north (Alborz Mountains), east (Tabas region) and central-southeast Iran were compared, using the Jaccard similarity index, with synchronous faunas from 28 localities spread across Gondwana, Euramerica, Siberia, Kazakhstan, and South China. The highest levels of similarity occur between brachiopod taxa from the three Iranian localities and terranes traditionally regarded as part of the northern margin of Gondwana (especially Afghanistan, Armenia, NW Pakistan, Libya, Cantabrian Mountains and Iberia). The distribution of benthic shelf faunas was probably strongly influenced by climatic (latitudinal) continuity, geographic proximity and open dispersal routes along the "North Gondwana Current". Jaccard analysis also reveals some biogeographic links between Iranl Afghanistan and Euramerica throughout the Late Devonian, supporting the hypothesis that a narrow « 1000 km) Prototethys Ocean separated the two super continents during this interval.

N2  - Pragian (Early Devonian) brachiopod data from the Asia-Australia hemisphere have been analysed numerically in an attempt to decipher biogeographic relationships which may have implications with respect to the dynamics of crustal blocks in the hemisphere. Results of numerical analysis accord with earlier qualitative analysis (Talent <em>et al</em>. 1987): that there was a high level of brachiopod provincialism during mid-Palaeozoic times. Quantitative analysis moreover revealed new aspects of interrelationships between brachiopod associations from block to block. Three provinces are indicated around the margins of the Siberian continent in much the same way as provinces are arrayed around the margins of the main continental blocks of the present day, the positions of the latter-and presumably of those arranged around the Siberian continent during Pragian times-being determined by latitude and the circulation pattern of colder and warmer waters. The two provincially discrete entities (West Ural and Polar Ural faunas, 1 and 2) on the margin of the Russian Platform are likewise explicable in terms of palaeolatitude and palaeoceanic circulation. The four regions of the Southern Hemisphere--Melbourne, Tabberabbera-Molong, West Tasman and Takaka (New Zealand)-are represented by Pragian brachiopod associations indicative of a discrete province, though the Takaka (New Zealand) faunas are rather more endemic than the others.

N2  - Upper Devonian ammonoids from the Canning Basin of Western Australia represent one of the most diverse faunas globally known. It consists of cosmopolitan (pantropical), endemic and "spot" taxa (with disjunct distribution in few widely separated basin). Endemism is low at the generic but very significant (ca. 50%) at the species level. Linked with regional facies change and eustatic influences, there were alternating episodes with lowdiverse, relatively highly endemic or with species-rich and rather cosmopolitan faunas. Faunal similarities both in the Frasnian and Famennian were closest with Germany, slightly less with North Africa, SW England, the Ardennes, and the Montagne Noire. Frasnian faunal links with the Timan and eastern North America were severed after the Frasnian-Famennian boundary whilst relationships with the Urals and Poland became closer. Faunal similarities were clearly more dependent on regional facies developments of plates than on their spatial distance. The regional diversity curve reflects both global extinctions and radiations as well as effects of Canning Basin structural evolution. Three major extinctions, the Bugle Gap, Lower Kellwasser and Upper Kellwasser Events occurred in the Frasnian. Not a single ammonoid species regionally survived the Frasnian-Famennian boundary and the basal Famennian lacked ammonoids all over Australia. The post-<em>Annulata</em> Event regression regionally initiated a strong final decline of ammonoid faunas.

N2  - Devonian and Carboniferous crinoid faunas of Gondwana are generally not as large or well known as faunas from Laurentia and Baltica. Devonian faunas are known from three regions in Gondwana: Northern Africa (Morocco and Algeria), eastern Australia, and the southwestern edge of Gondwana in a belt extending from the Karoo Basin of South Africa through West Falkland Island into the Chaco Basin of Argentina and Bolivia, into Columbia. Most faunas are of Early Devonian age, mostly Emsian. No faunas are recognized from the Frasnian and only one specimen has been referred to questionable Famennian strata. Australian and Northern Africa faunas show closer affinity to Baltica faunas at the generic level. The Australian and southwestern edge Gondwanan faunas have the most endemic genera. These may be cold water Devonian faunas or they may support a generally warmer global climate for the Devonian as the southwesten edge faunas were living at 60° to 85° S latitude.

N2  - This paper reports the first detailed study of the vascular flora of the southern Carnarvon Basin, an area of c. 75 000 km2. A total flora of 2133 taxa of vascular plants was listed for the area. There are eight major conservation reserves which have 1559 taxa present in them. Most of the 574 unreserved taxa are wetland taxa, taxa of tropical affinities or those only present on the Acacia shrublands of the central basin. Vegetation patterning at a regional scale showed the major floristic boundary in the south west of the study area, which in turn reflected the major climatic gradients of the area. The other major influence on vegetation patterning was soil type.

N2  - The southern boundary of the Carnarvon phytogeographic district separates the arid <em>Acacia</em> shrublands from the species rich heaths and woodlands of the Irwin region. This boundary has previously been mapped at a scale of 1 : 250000 using the structure, density and composition of the dominant perennial plant species. One hundred quadrats were established across this boundary to determine if floristic composition correlated with the mapped position of this boundary. Our results suggest that the boundary of the Southwestern Botanical Province should move west and south to exclude the <em>Acacia</em> - <em>Casuarina</em> thicket on red sandplain and the tree heaths south of Shark Bay. In terms of species and family composition the vegetation of these areas is more similar to typical Carnarvon vegetation than to the scrub heaths of the yellow sandplains of the Irwin. Major edaphic patterns are strongly correlated with the position of the revised boundary.

The flora was dominated by arid species but also included 34 temperate taxa at the northern end of their range and 18 tropical taxa at the southern end of their range. Five species (<em>Dichopogon</em> <em>tyleri</em>, <em>Calandrinia</em> sp. Coolcalalaya (GJK and NG 698), <em>Myriocephalus</em> <em>gascoynensis</em> ms, <em>Lythrum</em> sp.

N2  - Fifty-six sites, representing 53 wetlands, were surveyed in the southern Carnarvon Basin in 1994 and 1995 with the aim of documenting the waterbird and aquatic invertebrate fauna of the region. Most sites were surveyed in both winter and summer, although some contained water only one occasion. Altogether 57 waterbird species were recorded, with 29 292 waterbirds of 25 species on Lake MacLeod in October 1994. River pools were shown to be relatively important for waterbirds, while many freshwater claypans were little used.

N2  - Ten scorpion species of four genera were recorded from 61 quadrats positioned through the 75 000 km2 study area, and sampled continuously over a 12 month period (114 000 trap nights). An average of 3.1 species were recorded per quadrat. Analysis of the data matrix revealed that species abundance patterns related to various climatic and soil attributes, particularly soil texture, while assemblage composition conformed with annual average precipitation.

N2  - Nineteen genera belonging to seven families were recorded during a systematic survey of mygalomorph spiders in the southern Carnarvon Basin, a region on the central coast of Western Australia. The study was based on collections of predominantly male specimens collected from pitfall traps. Of the 60 species distinguished, 55 were undescribed. Patterns in the species composition of assemblages conformed with the gradient in wettest quarter precipitation, although localised patterns of endemism were also apparent. Species richness at quadrats exceeded that of many other habitats in Western Australia. Seasonal occurrence of wandering males (phenology) agreed with that known for respective genera in other regions, particularly of the predominantly winter breeding Idiopidae. Unusually large numbers of specimens were collected of some small-bodied nemesiids (over 70 specimens at some quadrats); this indicates an extraordinary population density possibly comparable to patches in some mesophytic forests.

N2  - A survey of the ground-dwelling araneomorph spider assemblages of the Southern Carnarvon Basin revealed a total of 33 families. Apart from the Gnaphosidae and Zodariidae which were not analysed due to timeconstraints, we recognized a total of 285 species placed in 146 genera. Very few taxa could be assigned to existing genera or species, reflecting poor taxonomic knowledge of many groups of spiders. Patterns in species composition across the study area were correlated with rainfall gradients, and a discrete claypan fauna was detected. Vicariance events seem to explain part of the patterning evident. However, strongly localised patterns in species composition were also evident.

N2  - At least 15 species of centipedes and 11 species of millipedes were recorded from the southern Carnarvon basin. Centipede diversity is dominated by scolopendrids with 13 species, but most species are relatively widespread both within the survey area and in other regions of Western Australia. Centipede communities were found to be strongly correlated with rainfall and soil texture variables. Millipede diversity is dominated by members of the paradoxosomatid genus <em>Antichiropus</em> which is represented by seven undescribed species, five of which are restricted to individual survey areas. The other two species are found at two and three survey areas, respectively. These distribution patterns are seen elsewhere in Western Australia with <em>Antichiropus</em> which contains many highly localised species.

N2  - Geographic range and status is documented for the 279 bird species known to occur in the southern Carnarvon Basin, Western Australia. The 162 breeding species are mapped, and each was assessed for possible changes in abundance during the last century. No species is known to have become extinct. For about 75% of breeding species we could not detect a change, but about 13% have increased in abundance and 10-15% have decreased in abundance. These changes are comparable to those reported for a nearby arid area (the Murchison catchment), but are less than those reported for an eastern Australian arid area (western New South Wales).

N2  - We present the results of the first systematic survey of bats in the southern Carnarvon Basin. Two megabat and eleven microbat species were recorded. A twelfth microbat species, <em>Macroderma</em> <em>gigas</em>, is known from subfossil material. We demonstrate tight, functionally appropriate relationships between species' foraging microhabitats, flight performance indices, and echolocation call parameters. Patterns in the species composition of microbat assemblages across the study area conform with a 'temperate to tropical' climatic gradient, but are modified by variation in the structural complexity of the vegetation. Within the study area, these relationships allow the species composition of microbat assemblages to be predicted from vegetation structure and local availability of roost sites, and provide an explicit basis for assessing the reserve system from the perspective of microbats.

N2  - Site-based data on patterns in terrestrial and wetland biodiversity were used to identify some major gaps in the comprehensiveness of the reserve system in a 75000 km2 region on the mid-west coast of Western Australia. Data comprised lists of plants, birds, reptiles, frogs, mammals, ground-dwelling spiders, scorpions and centipedes from 63 terrestrial sites, and waterbirds, wetland plants and aquatic invertebrates from 51 wetland sites. The sites were positioned in a stratified array across the geographical extent of the region, but their number and dispersal was limited by the cost of sampling such a variety of taxa. Although this geographical sparsity limited the geographical resolution of the reserve selection procedures, a distinct lack of cross-taxon congruence in the geographical patterns of taxa implied that data on a range of taxa should be used to design the region's reserve system. We specify the biological characteristics and pattern of occurrence of 12 terrestrial communities and eight wetland-types that need to be added to the reserve system.

N2  - Between the familiar surface habitats of rivers and streams and the less well known groundwater environment lies an ecotone whose ill-defined boundaries oscillate in response to changes in surface discharge and groundwater pressure. This ecotone, termed the hyporheic zone, plays a crucial role as a dynamic chemical and physical filter between the adjacent ecosystems. It also potentially harbours a diverse fauna whose taxonomic composition in Australian waters is only now being explored. Given the dominance of this fauna by crustaceans in most parts of the world, coupled with Australia's rich hoard of syncarids and other Gondwanan relicts, it is likely that the biodiversity of the hyporheic zone of many of Australia's streams and rivers is considerable and exhibits high endemicity.

N2  - The Western Shield of Australia has been above sea level since the Palaeozoic. It is incised by ancient palaeovalieys now containing groundwater calcretes that are found throughout much of arid Australia. The calcretes are deposited, owing to surface evaporation, from a groundwater flow path that increases in salinity from fresh to hypersaline groundwater each terminating at a salt lake (playa). The calcrete aquifers contain a diverse obligate groundwater fauna (stygofauna: predominantly Crustacea) in one of the oldest non-marine landscapes on Earth. Each of the 11 calcrete areas examined so far contains a unique fauna; there are over 210 large discrete calcrete bodies in the Western Australian arid zone. This paper examines a working hypothesis that the stygofauna became isolated in the upper tributaries of the palaeodrainage systems by the progressive upstream movement of salinity from the Eocene onwards. Although each calcrete body does have a unique fauna, as predicted by the hypothesis, the hypothesis has proved too simple because the hydrochemical cycles are repeated along the length of the palaeochannels, each terminating in a saltlake immediately downflow of the calcrete. A new hypothesis has to incorporate these intervals of hypersaline groundwater/ calcrete discontinuities acting as barriers to dispersal of the stygofauna. The paper focuses on the geological and landscape setting, and the hydrochemical and groundwater context in which this stygal diversity is found. It is intended to serve as a background resource for further work on this diverse stygofauna. A synopsis is provided of the knowledge of this stygofauna. The presence of such highly diverse and locally endemic stygofauna, often ancient relictual lineages, in a major economic resource within arid Australia poses delicate and chalienging conservation issues. At the same time the scientific challenge is considerable to understand the development and functioning of these systems in order that they can be managed sustainably.

N2  - Fossil fish remains belonging to the <em>Wuttagoonaspis</em> assemblage are described from the Devonian rocks of the Georgina Basin, central Australia. The study is based on some 450 samples from 30 localities in the lower Dulcie Sandstone of the Dulcie Syncline (Northern Territory), and Cravens Peak Beds of the Toko Syncline (western Queensland). First recorded from the Darling Basin of western New South Wales, the diverse <em>Wuttagoonaspis</em> assemblage was probably the first vertebrate fauna to become established in rivers and lakes of the Australian continent. It occurs over an area of about one million km2, but up to now only one species has been described from the type area. The Georgina Basin assemblage is highly endemic, with some 20 genera representing about 13 taxa of family or higher rank. It includes three of the four major groups of jawed vertebrates (placoderrns, acanthodians, osteichthyans), and at least two agnathan groups: pituriaspids (previously described), and thelodontids (unstudied). Amongst placoderms, the order Arthrodira is represented by at least six families, one of which is new (family Bulbocanthidae). Seven new arthrodire species are assigned to the following new genera: <em>Lurapulllaspis</em>, <em>Toombalepis</em>, <em>Tnoralaspis</em>, <em>Ethabukaspis</em>, <em>Tokolepis</em>, <em>Cravenaspis</em>, and <em>Mithakaspis</em>. A new species, <em>Wuttagoonaspis</em> <em>milligani</em> sp. nov., is erected within the genus <em>Wuttagoonaspis</em> Ritchie, 1973 (endemic family Wuttagoonaspidae), the only named taxon from the Darling Basin assemblage. <em>Huginaspis</em> <em>australis</em> sp. nov. is assigned to the genus <em>Huginaspis</em> Heintz, 1929 (family Phlyctaeniidae), previously known from the Early-Middle Devonian of Spitsbergen. <em>Tnoralaspis</em> <em>petercooki</em> gen. et sp. nov. has its type locality at Gosses Bluff in the Amadeus Basin (Pertnjara Group). The new actinolepidoid family Bulbocanthidae (<em>Lurapullaspis</em> <em>johannseni</em> gen. et sp. nov.) is also known from the Early Devonian of western USA, Spitsbergen, and Severnaya Zemlya. <em>Toombalepis</em> <em>tuberculata</em> gen. et sp. nov. is placed in the actinolepidoid family Antarctaspidae, also known from the Devonian of Antarctica (<em>Antarctaspis</em> White, 1968) and South China (<em>Yujiangolepis</em> Wang <em>et aI</em>., 1998). <em>Cravenaspis</em> <em>trematosus</em> gen. et sp. nov. is provisionally placed in the phlyctaenioid family Arctaspididae, also known from Spitsbergen. <em>Mithakaspis</em> <em>lyentye</em> gen. et sp. nov. is referred to the cosmopolitan family Groenlandaspidae, together with another new genus (unnamed), and two indeterminate species cf. <em>Groenlandaspis</em> Heintz, 1932. The placoderm order Petalichthyida is represented by an indeterminate genus and species, and the class Acanthodii by indeterminate fin spines. Osteichthyan remains apparently include three orders of sarcopterygians (?rhizodontids, ?porolepiforms, onychodontids), but the material is insufficient to erect new taxa.

N2  - Subtidal habitats at 45 locations were recorded on video during the diving surveys of the Dampier Archipelago in 1998 (DA1/98) and 1999 (DA3/ 99) and analysed for percentage cover in terms of 13 benthic categories. The video recording provided a permanent record of each station while the video transect analysis provided a quantitative description of the benthic habitat to complement the semi-quantitative specimen collections. A statistical comparison of the habitats present indicated that the survey stations could be grouped into seven distinct categories (abiotic - six stations; macroalgae four stations; gorgonian soft corals - one station; neptheid and alcyoniid soft corals - five stations; foliose non-Acropora hard corals - one station; branching Acropora - two stations; massive non-Acropora - four stations) and one less distinct category (abiotic and hard coral habitats, predominantly massive non-Acropora or tabulate Acropora species - twenty two stations) based on dominant percentage cover.

This brings the total number of these corals for the Dampier Archlpelago to 229 species from 57 genera. The Dampier Archipelago is placed second only to Ashmore Reef in terms of number of coral species for a Western Australian reef. High species richness did not necessarily mean high coral cover. The first reported case of a hard coral containing mature ova during spring on the west coast of Australia is described. A complete updated list of azooxanthellate scleractinian corals recorded from the Dampier Archipelago is also presented (25 taxa in 6 families).

N2  - Thirty-five species of littoral and shallow-water barnacle species were collected during the expeditions and fieldwork in the tropical waters of the Dampier Archipelago. Barnacle communities stratify on the basis of depth, with intertidal, shallow subtidal and deeper subtidal communities recognisable. Clear distribution differences exist between intertidal and deeper water communities; the shallower water subtidal community is somewhat intermediate, with some species wide-ranging. Species diversity is greatest in the intertidal whereas many of the deeper water stations are dominated by only one or two species. A checklist produced from barnacle records contained in the collections of Australian museums presently documents 49 littoral and shallow-water barnacle species from the Dampier Archipelago. The fauna is dominated by species with Indo-West Pacific and lndo-Australian distributions. It shows strong affinities with that of the Kimberley area to the north and many similarities with those of the more southern Muiron Islands, Exmouth Gulf and Montebello Islands in northern Western Australia. The fauna, however, differs significantly from the barnacle fauna of the southern Australian warm temperate province. First collections of <em>Balanus reticlulatus</em> and <em>Megabalanus</em> <em>rosa</em> raise the number of introduced barnacle species currently recorded from the Dampier Archipelago to six.

N2  - Three hundred and eighty-one crustacean taxa have been identified from collections made during the Woodside Dampier Archipelago diving and dredging expeditions between 1998 and 1999, bringing the total known from the area to 426. Most species (361) belong to the Decapoda. A total of 120 species are new records for the archipelago, 14 are new records for Western Australia, five are new records for Australia and three are new species. Species diversity was greatest in the intertidal and shallow subtidal waters around the islands, where there was generally a high diversity of potential hosts for crustacean symbionts. These areas were characterised by a dominance of xanthoid crabs. Diversity was lowest in the deeper inter-island waters typified by soft and rocky bottoms with few potential hosts. The anomuran Porcellanidae and the brachyuran Portunidae were dominant at these sites. The collection has a high occurrence of Indo-West Pacific species typical of the Northern Australian faunistic province.

N2  - A total of 695 molluscan species was recorded from intertidal and subtidal surveys conducted at the Dampier Archipelago, Western Australia during October 1998 and August-September 1999. There was a considerable degree of overlap in the molluscan faunas of the eastern and the central and western sectors. However, an east/west gradation in bottom type and exposure is associated with a significant difference in the faunas of the two areas. Of the 523 species recorded from the steeper, higher energy eastern sector, 153 were not recorded from the central and western sectors. Similarly, 180 of the 536 species from the generally more sheltered waters of the central and western sectors were not found further east. However, 199 species were recorded from only a single station during the two survey periods, with 92 of these being found only in the eastern sector and 107 found only in the central and western sectors. Such records contrast with those of the 29 species recorded from 20 or more stations. The greatest diversity of molluscan species was recorded from subtidal habitats characterised mainly or exclusively by living or non-living hard substrata. A slightly lower but comparable diversity was recorded from intertidal and subtidal soft substrata. The molluscan diversity of intertidal hard substrata was approximately one-third that occurring on subtidal hard substrata and on the combined intertidal/subtidal substrata. The diversity of the fauna of these three habitat groupings was much greater than that recorded from the mangals and those recorded in close association with plants and other animal groups. More detailed examination of these habitats than was possible during this survey would undoubtedly lead to an increase in these numbers. The overall diversity of molluscan species recorded for the Dampier Archipelago waters during this survey is greater than those of other Western Australian areas between the Houtman Abrolhos and the western Kimberley areas which have been similarly surveyed.

N2  - From a dredge survey of the subtidal fauna of the Dampier Archipelago a total of 422 species of macromolluscs was identified, comprising 227 gastropods, 188 bivalves, four scaphopods and three chitons. Most species were uncommon but abundant taxa included the bivalves <em>Melaxinaea</em> <em>vitrea</em>, <em>Corbula</em> <em>tunicata</em> and <em>C. crassa </em>and the gastropods <em>Herpetopoma</em> <em>atrata</em> and <em>Xenophora</em> <em>solarioides</em>. Community analysis identified eight molluscan assemblages, reflecting the varied and patchy nature of the substrates that ranged from muds and silts to coarse sands, gravel, rubble and rocks. The most species-rich stations were those located inshore at water depths &lt;10 m. These muddy stations were also notable for the diversity and abundance of suspension-feeding bivalves. Most of the mollusc species identified are distributed widely around tropical Australia and the Indo-West Pacific but a few are endemic to northwestern Australia, including the newly described lucinid bivalve <em>Lamellolucina</em> <em>pilbara</em>.

N2  - The results of two diving surveys (DA1/98 and DA3/99) and a dredge survey (DA2/99) conducted in the waters of the Dampier Archipelago, Western Australia, are summarised. The diving surveys sampled 70 sites in the eastern (DA1/98) and western (DA3/99) halves of the Archipelago. Considerable differences were demonstrated between the echinoderm faunas of these areas, with more species (139) recorded in western than eastern (115) areas and only 74 species in common between the two. There are major habitat differences between the eastern and western parts of the archipelago, with more areas of soft substrate in the western part, providing more habitat for astropectinid starfishes and burrowing heart urchins. The dredging survey (DA2/99), which sampled 100 sites spread throughout the archipelago, showed that the area has an extremely rich echinoderm fauna, unmatched by any other in Western Australia. Fifty-two percent of the species taken by dredging were not found on the dive surveys. A complete list of all species found during the diving and dredging expeditions (260) and a supplementary list of material from the Dampier Archipelago held in the Western Australian Museum are presented, making a total of 286 species, the highest number recorded from any part of Western Australia. This rich fauna is a reflection of the diversity of habitats and the range of exposure to wave action, turbidity and currents related to the complex topography of the archipelago. The archipelago is the type locality of three valid echinoderm species and two from deeper water north of the archipelago. The distribution of species falls roughly into five groups: 9% are endemic to northwestern Western Australia, with some extending into the Northern Territory; 11% are endemic to northern Australia including Queensland and some extending to New South Wales; 28% extend northward to Indonesia, with some to Japan; 47% are widespread Indo-West Pacific species; and 6% are Indian Ocean species extending to the Red Sea or Persian Gulf.

N2  - The shallow-water fish fauna of the Dampier Archipelago (to a depth of 30 m), which now totals 650 species, consists of a rich coral reef fauna (465 species), a moderate mangrove one (116 species), smaller numbers of soft bottom inhabitants (106 species) and a relatively low number of pelagic species (67). The outer islands are inhabited predominantly by coral reef fishes whereas inner areas close to the mainland are occupied by mangrove and silty-bottom dwellers. The inter-island passages have a relatively rich soft bottom fauna. Species diversity is at its highest in areas of high topographic diversity, the area with the highest diversities lying along the exposed northern perimeter of the archipelago. These more off-shore areas are apparently under the direct influence of the off-shore flowing, warm Leeuwin Current, where water clarity is high and propagules from upstream locations, such as the Rowley Shoals, are deposited. The more in-shore areas are affected by high turbidity resulting from mangrove communities and high freshwater runoff during cyclonic events. The fish fauna of the archipelago is closely related to that occurring at the more off-shore Monte Bello Islands, but is noticeably less diverse than the islands of the West Pilbara region to the south. Some elements of the Kimberley fish fauna also inhabit the archipelago.

N2  - A biological survey of wetlands in the Wheatbelt and adjacent coastal areas of south-west Western Australia was undertaken to document the extent and distribution of the region's aquatic invertebrate diversity. Two hundred and thirty samples were collected from 223 wetlands, including freshwater swamps and lakes, salinised wetlands, springs, rivers, artificial wetlands (farm dams and small reservoirs), saline playas and coastal salt lakes between 1997 and 2000. The number of aquatic invertebrates identified from the region has been increased five-fold to almost 1000 species, of which 10% are new and known to date only from the Wheatbelt, and another 7% (mostly rotifers and cladocerans) are recorded in Western Australia for the first time. The survey has provided further evidence of a significant radiation of microcrustaceans in south-west Western Australia. Comparison of the fauna with other regions suggests that saline playas and ephemeral pools on granite outcrop support most of the species likely to be restricted to the Wheatbelt. Most species were collected infrequently, but for many of the least common species the Wheatbelt is likely to be on the periphery of their range.

N2  - Eight hundred and thirteen quadrats were surveyed to sample wetland vegetation throughout the wheatbelt and adjacent south coast of Western Australia, an area of ca. 220 000 km2. Two hundred and fourteen wetlands were intensively sampled with between one and ten quad rats placed at each wetland to capture the major vegetation zonation. A further 100 quadrats were scattered through the study area to sample particular examples of wetland vegetation. Sampling spanned the full range of elevations at wetlands from inundated basins to the adjacent landforms such as lunettes.

N2  - Ground-dwelling frogs, reptiles and small mammals were sampled at 252 quadrats chosen to represent the geographical extent and diversity of uncleared terrestrial environments across the Western Australian wheatbelt. These sites were not overtly affected by secondary salinisation, but did include sites that were 'naturally' saline. We recorded a total of 144 species from 74 genera and 15 families. There was an average of 10.4 species per quadrat with a range from one to 19. Vertebrate species richness was highest on dissection valley floors and sandy depositional surfaces of the 'old plateau' but lowest on saltflats. Total species richness was positively correlated with high levels of sand, with low levels of soil nutrients and with good soil drainage. When frogs, reptiles and mammals were considered separately, temperature and rainfall attributes were also shown to exhibit correlations with species richness. Patterns in species composition could be explained in terms of climatic and substrate variables, including salinity. Two distinct faunas were identified - one concentrated in the semi-arid northern and inland parts of the study area, and one concentrated in the more mesic south and south-east. Further patterning could be discerned within this dichotomy, including the existence of a small group of species that arc associated with saline areas. Correlations between climatic and substrate variables could be discerned even at very low levels in the classification analysis, suggesting strong deterministic patterns in vertebrate species composition across the study area. Integrated management programs over entire catchments will be necessary in order to maintain conservation values, but there is doubt that the impacts of salinisation and fragmentation can be mitigated quickly enough to allow the small, ground-dwelling vertebrate fauna to withstand the effects of these processes in the Western Australian wheatbelt.

The study area covered 230,000 km' or 70% of the South West Botanical Province, one of the world's 25 biodiversity hotspots. It included all or part of the six biogeographical regions centred on the wheatbelt. The native vegetation in the study area is highly fragmented with 74% having been cleared for agriculture. Clearing has not been uniform; more extensive areas of bushland remain along the southern and western margins.

N2  - A survey of the salticid spider fauna of the wheatbelt revealed a total of 41 genera and 121 species, of which 17 genera and 106 species are undescribed. Patterns in the species composition of assemblages across the survey area were broadly correlated with environmental gradients, particularly Maximum Temperature in the Warmest Period. High proportions of apparently localised endemic species dominated the geographical patterns in species composition. A rare, widely distributed, compositionally discrete, saline-associated fauna was detected. Taxonomic revisions taking into account fauna collections from surrounding areas are required to understand the relationships between localised endemics and environmental gradients.

Analysis of the data at the landscape scale showed no significant relationships between species composition and substrate at each quadrat, other than a weak north-south changeover in composition. Strongly localised patterns of composition at the species level were overt, with a high proportion of short-range endemic species. However a regional-scale analysis (of species compositional patterns by survey area) showed a distinct relationship with precipitation in the driest period. Also, species richness for each survey area and each landform type revealed a correlation between low richness and both high rainfall and low drainage. Greater knowledge of zodariid ecology is required to determine the possible influence of microhabitats on species composition.

N2  - Five saline wetlands in the Western Australian wheatbelt were surveyed for their terrestrial invertebrate fauna (Araneae, Scorpionida, Coleoptera, Dermaptera, Formicidae and lsopoda). Surveys were restricted to dry lake floor and fringing samphire and woodlands with the aim of assessing whether there are species of native fauna restricted to one or more of these habitats. A total of 356 species were recorded (123 spiders, 6 scorpions, 173 beetles, 45 ants, 4 earwigs and 4 isopods). Of these, 198 were from the inundation zone (lake floor and samphire zones) and 229 from woodland; only 72 species were common to both areas. Thus, the inundation zone fauna is not a subset of that found in woodland. Assemblage richness and structure differed between wetlands, reflecting recorded levels of regional diversity. Classification and ordination of the data reflected differences in faunal composition both between habitats and between geographic areas, although all woodland habitats were more closely related to each other than to either lake floor or samphire habitats from the same wetland.

A total of 744 species comprising 39 families were recorded, of which the families Salticidae (121 species), Zodariidae (117), Theridiidae (80), Lycosidae (61), Oonopidae (46) and Lamponidae (41) exhibited a marked species-level radiation. For analysis, families with a high proportion of arboreal species, and quadrats that were often flooded or overtly affected by secondary salinity, were excluded. Thus, a total of 622 species from 240 quadrats were analysed, with an average of 21.9 (s.d. = 8.3) species per quadrat. Most of the variation observed in the patterns of species composition could be explained in terms of summer temperature, precipitation seasonality, soil salinity and pH attributes. Assemblage species richness was constrained by soil salinity, except for the Lycosidae which showed a positive relationship.

N2  - Prudent allocation of scarce conservation resources requires rigour in the indentification of conservation areas. We sought to broadly identify areas within the wheatbelt that would efficiently represent assemblages derived from the biological survey considered susceptible to the threat of salinity. We inferred the spatial distribution of each assemblage's species richness using a simple interpolation procedure. After omitting assemblages considered not to be threatened by salinity, as well as those for which the interpolation procedure failed to discriminate areas of high and low richness, analyses were undertaken using 17 aquatic and 6 terrestrial assemblages. To gain an appreciation of the magnitude of resourcing required for different levels of representation, we described the number of subcatchments and the area required to satisfy a range of conservation targets, where targets were based on the number of species associated with each assemblage. Near-optimal solutions were identified using a heuristic algorithm principally driven by a measure of irreplaceability for each of 829 subcatchments comprising the study area.

N2  - Alan Solem's systematic work focused on Pacific island Endodontoidea and on Australian Camaenidae. His many papers on these taxa deal with 647 species (329 new) and 136 genera. His descriptions and identification criteria are detailed and clear. Though not a formal cladist, his interpretation of characters shows that his approach was intuitively cladistic, and his phylogenies are likely to survive formal analysis. His comprehensive revisions, and his cataloguing of whole faunas enabled him to analyse patterns of distribution, and to relate them to evolutionary, biogeographic and ecological theory. For the Pacific Islands, he exposed the limitations of the equilibrium theory of MacArthur and Wilson, drawing attention to its neglect of <em>in situ</em> speciation. In Australia, he identified many cases of remarkable allopatric distributions amongst camaenid genera and species, many of which have minute geographical ranges. Because he studied the whole fauna, and achieved remarkable geographical coverage, he could contrast these patterns with those seen in other families, and in the much richer faunas he studied in New Zealand, where many congeners coexist. He used his experience as a basis for a global review of land snail diversity. Some of the questions and ideas he raised are discussed here and elsewhere in the symposium. At the time of his death, Solem was working on the description of more material (8-10 genera and c. 100 species), and had started to explore the evolutionary events underlying these contrasts. Both his described and undescribed materials are available in WAM and FMNH, and offer the opportunity for cladistic and molecular analysis, answering questions of theoretical and conservation concern. His work has already informed conservation planning in Western Australia. Snail faunas are good general indicators of conservation value, and the completion of his work will further aid conservation planning.

N2  - Sri Lankan snails have a complex history that might be linked to events ranging from Mesozoic plate tectonics and climate change on a global scale to more recent regional climate change and human impact. The fauna could include ancient groups that may have been present in Pangaea, diversified in Gondwana and survived in Deccan Plate refugia at the KIT boundary and Pangaean taxa that arrived via Eurasia. Taxa could have been assimilated from continental fragments encountered during the northward rafting of the Deccan Plate. Fauna colonising immediately following Eurasian contact could have been a regional fauna associated with Tibetan plateau plate fragments. There may have been a brief period when an Arabian corridor was open to African faunas and there was likely to have been a succession of immigrants through the Assam corridor or through long distance dispersal. The presence of <em>Acavus</em> and <em>Oligospira</em> as endemic acavoids in Sri Lanka and the complete absence of acavoids from India as well as the presence of at least 10 species of <em>CoriIla</em> and only one in India, give a greater potential Gondwanan identity to Sri Lanka's snail fauna. A similar pattern with <em>Tortulosa</em> may also have ancient origins. It is possible, but perhaps doubtful, that this picture has been sustained since the KIT boundary. A more likely explanation might be that during successive Deccan Trap lava flows Gondwanan snails survived as a small relict fauna in a southern Deccan Plate refuge and possibly a north eastern refuge. Snail faunas could have later dispersed across the intertrappean and supratrappean landscape from a refuge or refugia to be largely replaced in India by a subsequent combination of climate change and competition from a succession of colonizing species. A notable feature of the Sri Lankan snail fauna is the level of endemism and lack of shared components with India at the species level. A high level of endemism may have been present in the highland areas of Sri Lanka through the Cenozoic and earlier, and current endemism may be a mixture that includes Mesozoic elements. However, species turnover could be high and many of the current species could have become established in the Quaternary. Most of the Sri Lankan land snail species diversity and endemism is confined to forests in the wet zone of the Southwest. The maintenance of high levels of endemism and generation of high species diversity in a confined area through long periods is thought to be linked to the varied topography in Sri Lanka and the capacity for altitudinal faunal shifts in response to climate change. The remaining fragmented forests in a mosaic of transformed habitats no longer offer such capacity for altitudinal adjustment giving a poor prognosis for the long-term survival of the fauna.

N2  - As elsewhere, invertebrate taxa have received little attention in conservation planning in India. The Western Ghats has been designated as a global biodiversity hotspot, one of only two such designations in India. We have assembled a database for land snail records in the region, incorporating both published records and the results of our own surveys over the last three years. Of the 269 species  so far recorded, 75% are endemic to the region. Many species have very restricted ranges within the region. There is a decline in diversity and local endemism from south to north. The southernmost division (8-12°N) has much the riched recorded fauna (210 species), and the highest level of local endemism (56%). The latter is much lower in the central (12-16°N) and northern (16-21°N) divisions. There is thus considerable faunal turnover within the region. The overall level of endemism is higher than that recorded for other taxa, and our data have already been used to identify three local hotspots within the region. These results are discussed in terms of present climate and habitats, and in terms of environmental history. Comparisons are made with studies on other continents, and the impact of human activity by the destruction and fragmentation of habitats is considered.

N2  - Richness and shell size distributions of land snail faunas were analyzed from 838 sites sampled within ten geographic regions spread across a 2,300 x 2,800 km area in eastern North America, extending from tundra and taiga to tallgrass prairie, mixed boreal-hardwood, deciduous and evergreen subtropical forest. A total of 410,667 individuals from 166 taxa were encountered. These data documented: (1) Eastern North American land snail communities are frequently marked by high levels of syntopic species richness. Over 52% of sites exceeded 12 co-occurring taxa, with almost 10% supporting more than 24 taxa. Two percent of sites harbored 30 or more taxa. (2) Site richness was inversely related to latitude, with an almost 5-fold decrease towards the north. (3) Site richness was least in oligotrophic and grassland habitats, and greatest on base-rich bedrock outcrops. (4) Communities are dominated by taxa with maximum shell dimensions of &lt;5 mm, representing almost 75% of species and over 80% of individuals within sites in most regions. Taxa with shells 10 mm or larger never constituted more than 16% of taxa and 7% of individuals in average sites. (5) Northern communities harbored a more narrow range of size distributions, with both the largest (10+ mm) and smallest &lt;2 mm) size classes becoming less frequent. (6) Medium and large shelled taxa were most frequent in outcrop and lowland forest habitats, while minute species were most frequent in grasslands. (7) The contribution of a and y diversity to regional richness was greatest in the north, with 41% of taxa being found on average in Churchill, Manitoba sites. However, the contribution of B diversity peaked in the south. These results suggest that the latitudinal gradient in land snail richness in eastern North America is related not only to an increase in the number of niches and guilds towards the south, but also to increased niche overlap towards the north.

N2  - -Alan Solem highlighted the high alpha diversity of land snails that occur in forests of mid-western North Island New Zealand, This paper examines patterns of diversity in land snails across the entire New Zealand archipelago, with a review of the biogeography and composition of taxon groups and with analyses of faunal composition and ecological diversity at national, island and bioregion scales based primarily on collation of museum records, Community composition and structure are also analysed using two extensive series of plot-based assessments. The fauna is primarily Gondwanan in origin, with apparently little influence from establishment of new taxa by chance dispersal since the late Paleocene. It has undergone extensive <em>in situ</em> cladogenesis and speciation that, combined with island biogeographic processes of dispersal and extinction, have resulted in marked intraarchipelago differences in the character of regional species pools. Species richness of communities (0 - 74 for 400 m2 plots) was shown to vary substantially within and between bioregions, in part related to patterns of niche availability driven by temporal and spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions and floristic diverSity, It is concluded that in general the New Zealand land snail communities are not in a state of equilibrium, and that the highly dynamic nature of the environment prevents this, Only where regional conditions have favoured persistence of a diversity of forest habitat over several million years is high mean species richness evident at the plot scale. The New Zealand fauna exhibits a strong predominance of minute species with low shell height:diameter ratios. The essentially unimodal dispersion in the shell morphospace contrasts markedly with the bimodal pattern exhibited in many other faunas, If shell shapes define the repertoire of available niches then there is something different about New Zealand in respect to the niches occupied by land snails. However, the shell morphology in the New Zealand representatives of snail families conforms rather closely to that expected within the respective families worldwide, suggesting the morphospace pattern seen in the New Zealand fauna is largely a product of phylogenetic constraint, and has little to do with ecology. The high levels of cladogenesis evident in the New Zealand fauna suggest innovations in ecological niches that are not evident in examination of the shell height:diameter morphospace.

When supplemented with the results of similar research in Madagascar and West Africa by other workers, the information provides a more detailed picture of the patterns of land-snail diversity on the continent than was available to Solem (1984). We describe our field methods, re-examine Solem's (1984) assessments of sympatric, allopatric and mosaic diversity patterns in African forests and provide a review of overall species number at continental, regional and country-wide scales, and in the main African forest biomes that have been studied.

N2  - The forest snail fauna of northern Europe originated from postglacial colonization from the south. While it is regionally poor (c. 150 species, excluding slugs), individual localities (clusters of sample sites within a few km of each other) can be rich by global standards (up to 57 species). Distance decay in faunal similarity is very gradual in lowland regions, but Carpathian faunas are sharply differentiated, and hold the most endemics. British faunas are remarkably uniform. Very little of this differentiation is due to congeneric replacement; it results mostly from shifts in the richness of whole families. Clausiliids in particular predominate in the Carpathians and adjacent areas, but this is not reflected in the apparent density of individuals: as species richness increases, average abundance of each declines. In general, small species are more Widely distributed than large ones. Although the richest localities are found in the Carpathians, regional variation in local richness is slight. Substrate has Significant effects: oligotrophic areas have poorer and more locally variable faunas. At a slightly larger scale, areas of less than 100 km2 holding more than 60 species can be found in many parts of the region (even more when slugs are included); the richest such patches hold about half the whole regional forest fauna. Comparison with limited data from regions further south shows that although they have much richer regional faunas, local communities are no richer than those of the north. Distance decay is much more rapid. These results are discussed, with global comparisons, in terms of the ways in which molluscan communities are assembled and structured.

N2  - In the present paper we study the biogeography of land snails in the Skyros archipelago (central Aegean) using both conventional species-area analysis and the newly-developed choros model. The choros model is a simple mathematical relationship, which analyses species richness as a function of area and of environmental heterogeneity, quantified by assessing the number of defined habitats present on each island. We surveyed land snails on 12 islands of the archipelago of Skyros in the central Aegean Sea (Greece). The different types of habitats were defined based on the ecology and biology of each species distributed in the archipelago. Forty-two land snail species were recorded living in 11 different habitat types. The z-values from both models, the choros and the classic species-area relationship, place the archipelago in the "within biogeographic province" category, mainly due to the recent formation of the archipelago. This recent formation resulted in a group of small islands still behaving as parts of a continuous landmass. The recorded extinction of land snails in the archipelago follows the general pattern of extinctions of this animal group in the Aegean area. The choros model gave a better fit to the data than the classic species-area model, indicating that the range of habitats available plays a significant role in determining faunal diversity independently of area. The availability of knowledge on the ecology of each species in most islands of the Aegean enabled us to recognise the key environmental features on which we based the definition of the habitat types. Such background knowledge is essential if island studies are to progress beyond the simple demonstration of a species! area relationship.

N2  - In this study the photosynthetic performance and efficiency of the symbiosis of different species of the Cladobranchia (Nudibranchia) with zooxanthellae (Dinophyceae) of the genus <em>Symbiodinium</em> Freudenthal, 1962 is investigated. The species studied include members of the Aeolidoidea (<em>Aeolidiella alba</em> Risbec, 1928, <em>Limenandra nodosa</em> Haefelfinger and Stamm, 1958, <em>Phestilla lugubris</em> (Bergh, 1870) <em>Phyllodesmium briareum</em> (Bergh 1896), <em>Spurilla australis </em>Rudman, 1982), one member of the former Arminoidea (<em>Dermatobranchus</em> sp.) and one of the Dendronotoidea (<em>Melibe</em> cf. <em>bucephala</em> Bergh, 1902). Long term cultivation under starving conditions indicates a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae in all investigated species by means of Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorescence. The data taken by a Diving-PAM (submersible Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer) indicate interspecific differences in the ability to retain photosynthetic active zooxanthellae and suggest different stages in the evolution of this symbiosis represented by different species of Nudibranchia. The efficiency of the symbiotic relationship can be correlated with morphological adaptations, especially the branching system of the digestive gland. Interspecific differences in the photosynthetic characteristics suggest different involved types or strains of <em>Symbiodinium</em>, depending on the specific food source and its distribution in geographic range and depth.

N2  - Sea hares (Opisthobranchia: Anaspidea) have long been known to form dense aggregations in shallow marine habitats. However, there have been few attempts to document the dynamics and causes of these aggregations. The present report investigates the population dynamics of <em>Bursatella leachii</em> found in association with a cyanobacterial bloom in tropical north Queensland, Australia. The aggregation was fuelled by a continual source of recruits and in laboratory testing, this population preferred a green alga to its prey item in the field, the cyanobacterium, <em>Calothrix crustacea</em>. Therefore, <em>B. leachii</em> has the ability to continually recruit in large numbers to seagrass beds in order to exploit an abundant but less preferred food resource.

N2  - Several approaches to examining the evolution of organisms have been tested over the past several decades. Specifically, morphological and molecular (DNA sequences) data sets are the most widely used methods to test a phylogenetic hypothesis. A cost benefit analysis of previously published studies of nudibranch mollusc phylogeny is presented. The previous studies utilized different types of data sets to derive hypotheses of relationships. The present cost benefit analysis examines the usefulness of the different data sets to verify an existing species level phylogeny. The existing hypothesis had been derived from morphological data only. Results of the present analysis indicate that two of the four data sets used, DNA sequence data and morphological characters, are the most effective when measured in terms of robustness of the resultant phylogeny and considering cost and time spent on the analysis. The other two data sets: sperm morphology and natural product chemistry were found to be valuable at higher taxonomic levels. Conclusions from the cost benefit analysis indicate that combinations of data can provide valuable insight into evolutionary relationships, allowing the researcher to further examine a hypothesis from various perspectives. Those perspectives include the molecular evolution of the organism, morphological character evolution, chemical evolution and reproductive evolution at a cellular level. Using a multidisciplinary approach to systematics reveals the complexities of evolution.

N2  - Genera in the largest family of the suborder Sacoglossa (Mollusca; Opisthobranchia), the Plakobranchidae Gray, 1840, have been systematically revised numerous times since the 1800s. Several authors have questioned the validity and inter-relationships of the genera <em>Tridachia</em> Moerch, 1863, <em>Tridachiella</em> MacFarland, 1924, <em>Elysiella</em> Bergh, 1872, <em>Pattyclaya</em> Marcus, 1982, Elysia Risso, 1818, and <em>Thuridilla</em> Bergh, 1872. For many other groups, molecular data have proven fruitful in determining the systematic relationships of organisms for which few suitable morphological characters are available. Using DNA sequence data from one nuclear (Histone 3) and two mitochondrial genes (Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I and large ribosomal subunit), we infer the phylogenetic relationships among five of the seven recently recognized genera within the Plakobranchidae. These data question the monophyly of the genus <em>Elysia</em> and suggest that further divisions within the genus may be necessary. Additionally, it appears that the family Boselliidae Marcus, 1982 may be, at least, paraphyletic since one member of the genus <em>Bosellia</em> Trinchese, 1891, clusters within the family Plakobranchidae.

N2  - Specimens of <em>Umbraculum</em> Schumacher, 1817 from the North Atlantic (Great Meteor Bank and Azores), the Mediterranean Sea and from the southwest Pacific (Australia, Solomon lds, New Zealand) were investigated anatomically and histologically to clarify whether U. <em>mediterraneum</em> (Lamarck, 1812) and U. <em>umbraculum</em> (Lightfoot, 1786) are two distinguishable species or only one. Additional molecular analyses of one specimen each from Australia, the Azores and the Great Meteor Bank were performed, using 18S rRNA, 16S rRNA and COl genes. The morphological and molecular investigations give no evidence supporting their separation into two species. We therefore consider U. <em>mediterraneum</em> to be a junior synonym of U. <em>umbraculum</em>, and follow the assumptions of Burn (1959) that there is only one species of <em>Umbraculum</em>, with a wide spread distribution in tropical and warm temperate waters.

The animals were collected in two different locations of Portugal and Spain, and were kept in the lab for reproduction and subsequent observation of the early development. The egg masses of both species consist of gelatinous flat ribbons coiled regularly. <em>D. areolata </em>pre-larval development was about 11-12 days, hatching a planktotrophic larva. In the case of <em>D. pelseneeri</em>, the development was direct with a juvenile hatching from the egg after 26-27 days. The different type of development could explain the wide geographic dispersion of <em>D. areolata</em> in comparison with the restricted distribution of <em>D. pelseneeri</em>.

N2  - <em>Facelina stearnsi</em> Cockerell, 1901 is known from Santa Cruz (Nelson 1986) to La Jolla, California (Behrens 1991). Several preserved specimens are examined and compared with the original description and other species in the genus <em>Austraeolis</em> Burn, 1962. The coloration, reproductive and radular morphology are described in detail for the first time using SEM, compound microscopy and photographs of live specimens. Observation of several new morphological and anatomical characters suggests a reassignment of <em>Facelina stearnsi</em> to the genus <em>Austraeolis</em> Burn, 1962.

N2  - The nudibranch Dendrodoris arborescens (Collingwood, 1881) has hitherto been (1) mistaken for the sympatric species <em>D. nigra</em> (Stimpson, 1855), which is similar in appearance; or (2) considered as a colour form of <em>D. fumata</em> (Ruppell and Leuckart, 1828). However, our investigations linking larval form, morphology and colour pattern, clearly show that <em>D. arborescens</em> is a separate valid species with its own set of unique characteristics. This result increases the number of <em>Dendrodoris</em> species known from Australian to thirteen, highlights the useful nature of larval features to species identification and contributes to the resolution of a previously confusing species complex.

N2  - Subterranean copepods have been studied from 160 samples (from around 150 different localities) in the Pilbara region, collected by the Department of Conservation and Land Management, Western Australian Museum, mining companies and environmental consultants between 1997 and 2003. A rich and interesting copepod fauna was found in this arid area, comprising 41 species and subspecies classified into 24 genera, seven families and two orders (Cyclopoida and Harpacticoida). The following five genera are new to science: <em>Australoeucyclops</em> (Eucyclopinae), <em>Orbuscyclops</em> (Cyclopinae), <em>Biameiropsis</em> (Ameiridae), <em>ArchinitocreIla</em> (Ameiridae), and <em>Abnitocrella</em> (Ameiridae). Two new subgenera are also described: <em>Rochacyclops</em> (in the genus <em>Halicyclops</em> Norman, 1903) and <em>Pilbaracyclops</em> (in the genus <em>Fierscyclops</em> Karanovic, 2004). Only 11 species were previously known from the region, so an additional 30 species and subspecies of copepods are reported for the first time in the Pilbara in this monograph. Of them, 23 species and subspecies are described as new to science and ascribed to the following 15 genera: <em>Halicyclops</em> Norman, 1903 (one new species); <em>Australoeucyclops</em> gen. nov. (one species), <em>Mesocyclops</em> Sars, 1914 (one), <em>Orbuscyclops</em> gen. nov.

N2  - A total of 66 species of Candoninae have been described or recorded from North America in the period between the years 1894 and 1990. The majority of these species are known from the United States of America and their type material is kept in the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington. Since they were described, many new genera have been established in the subfamily Candoninae and more important morphological features for generic discrimination have been found. The descriptions of the North American Candoninae species are not sufficient to enable a proper generic designation or to establish their relationships with other World representatives of the subfamily. This paper is the result of re-examination of almost the entire collection of North American Candoninae from the Smithsonian Museum, and has resulted in a description of one new species and supplementary descriptions of 23 species. Seventeen species and four subspecies known from North America are synonymized, and four species known from elsewhere are synonymized with some of the North American species. Several species are found to be misidentified and three are considered <em>incerte sedis.</em> As a result of this revision, with the addition of the synonyms already recognized, the number of North American Candoninae is reduced to 40 species. A key for their identification is provided. In addition, a key to the World representatives of the <em>caribbeana</em>-group of species of the genus <em>Typhlocypris</em> <em>Vejdovsky</em>, 1882 is given. The morphological characteristics of some examined species necessitate redefinition of the genera <em>Candona</em> Baird, 1845, <em>Eucandona</em> Daday, 1900 and <em>Fabaeformiscandona</em> Krstic, 1972. In the present paper the genus <em>Candona</em> is divided into two subgenera: <em>Candona s.str.</em> and <em>Neglectocandona</em> Krstic, 1993. The nominal subgenus is further divided into three species groups: <em>candida</em>-, <em>acuminata</em>-, and <em>intermedia</em>-group. <em>Neglectocandona</em> is divided into <em>neglecta</em>- and <em>triangulata</em>-group. The groups <em>intermedia</em> and <em>triangulata</em> are established here for the first time. The former group is endemic to North America, while the latter is endemic to Ohrid Lake. The generic diagnosis of the genera <em>Eucandona</em> and <em>Fabaeformiscandona</em> are narrowed and a discussion on the systematics of all three genera is given. The majority of the North American Candoninae, ie. 47%, belong to the genus <em>Candona</em>, 32% to the genus <em>Typhlocypris</em>, 13% to <em>Eucandona</em>, while <em>Nannocandona</em> Ekman, 1914, <em>Paracandona</em> Hartwig, 1899 and <em>Fabaeformiscandona</em> have one representative each (2.5%) in the North American fauna. Total of 14 species recorded in North America are also known from elsewhere, while 26 species are endemic to this region.

N2  - -- Forty-seven species of alpheid shrimp were collected by the Dampier Archipelago Expedition in 1998-2002. Six species are reported for the first time from northwestern Australia. The majority of the positively identified species (18, or 40%,) range widely from the western Indian Ocean;) and Red Sea to the central Pacific Ocean. Seventeen species (38%) range from the western Indian Ocean into the western Pacific, six species (13%) range trom the eastern Indian Ocean into the western Pacific, and 4 species (9%) range into the eastern Pacific. Three species of commensal shrimp were collected from corals and crinoids. Two species are strictly intertidal, 11 are strictly subtidal and 32 range from the lowest intertidal zone to subtidal depths. The majority of the shrimp inhabit areas of rocks, coral, shell or rubble, but <em>Alpheus rapacida</em> De Man, 1908 and <em>A serenei </em>Tiwari, 1963 typically live in sandy or muddy areas. We follow the systematic treatment of Chace (1988) and Banner and Banner (1973; 1975; 1982) 'for alpheids, but use a new subdivision, the "<em>Alpheus armillatus</em>" subdivision of the <em>Alpheus edwardsii</em> species group.

N2  - An examination of the specimens thought to represent the hermit crab genus <em>Paguristes sensu lato</em> in all of the major Australian Museums has provided material for the first comprehensive review of this taxon in Australian waters. In keeping with the current subdivision of <em>Paguristes</em>, the recently resurrected <em>Stratiotes</em> Thomson is represented by the former <em>Paguristes tuberculatus</em> Whitelegge. The two recently described species, <em>Paguristes monoporus</em> Morgan and <em>Paguristes laurentae</em> Morgan and Forest have been reassigned to <em>Pseudopaguristes</em>, the latter as the senior synonym of <em>Paguristes</em> <em>brachytes</em> Komai and <em>Pseudopaguristes</em> <em>gracilis</em> Rahayu. The regional fauna of <em>Paguristes</em> <em>sensu</em> <em>stricto</em> now includes 20 species, of which four are new to science. <em>Paguristes</em> <em>crinitimanus</em> sp. nov. and <em>P. triton</em> sp. nov. are described from the Northern Territory, <em>P. geminatus</em> sp. nov. from Queensland, and<em> P. dampierensis </em>sp. nov. from the Dampier Archipelago of Western Australia. Five species, <em>P. alcocki</em> McLaughlin and Rahayu, <em>P. palythophilus</em> Ortmann, <em>P. simplex</em> Rahayu and McLaughlin, <em>P. miyakei</em> Forest and McLaughlin, and <em>P. puniceus</em> Henderson, are new additions to the Australian fauna. Range extensions also have been recorded for six species, including two previously known only from the type localities. Full descriptions and illustrations are provided for the new taxa, while more abbreviated descriptions and figures accompany the remainder. Keys to the genera, and keys to the Australian species of <em>Pseudopaguristes</em> and <em>Paguristes</em> <em>s.s.</em> also are provided.

N2  - The hermit crab fauna of the Dampier Archipelago of Western Australia was found to consist of 34 species, representing the two major paguroid families, Diogenidae with 24 and Paguridae with 10. The Archipelago has provided new distributional records lor 9 ot the 24 diogenid species: <em>Clibanarius</em> <em>longitarsus</em>, <em>Dardanus</em> <em>hessi</em>, <em>D. squarrosus</em>, <em>Diogenes</em> <em>biramus</em>, <em>D. capricornis</em>, <em>D. dorotheae</em>, <em>D. pallescens</em>, <em>Paguristes</em> <em>alegrias</em> and <em>P. kimberleyensis</em>. The presence of <em>Ciliopagurus</em> <em>krempfi</em> is a new record tor Australia. Additionally, the new species of <em>Paguristes</em>, <em>P. dampierensis,</em> has been described in an accompanying paper in this volume. Of the 10 pagurid species, the Archipelago represents new distributional records for <em>Paguritta</em> <em>harmsi</em>, <em>Pagurus</em> <em>compressipes</em> and <em>P. hedleyi</em>. In addition to a new species, <em>Pagurus sticticus</em>, described from the Dampier collections, 4 species, <em>Anapagurus bonnieri</em>, <em>Icelopagurus</em> <em>undulatus</em>, <em>Nematopagurus</em> <em>australis</em> and <em>N. ostlingochirus</em>, represent new additions to the Australian fauna.

N2  - Background information is given on a biological survey of Faure; Island, Shark Bay, conducted to provide a basis for a translocation program involving threatened mammal species presently surviving on outer islands of the bay. Tenure, climate, geology and land forms of the island arc summarised. Late Pleistocene marine shell beds arc described that represent transgressive phases of the last interglacial. Above these are dune deposits containing fossil land snails deposited during the arid, low sea level period of the last glacial cycle prior to the post~glacial transgression that re~created the bay and isolated Faure as an island. This geomorphic history is discussed in relation to the extinction of the mammal species on the mainland of the region and the suitability of Faure Island as a translocation site.

N2  - Remains of four species of non-volant native mammals have been found on Faure Island: <em>Perameles bougainville </em>(Western Barred Bandicoot), <em>Bettongia penicillata</em> (Woylie or Brush-tailed Bettong), <em>Pseudomys fieldi</em> (Shark Bay Mouse) and <em>Rattus tunneyi</em> (Pale Field-rat). Three of these species, <em>Pe. bougainville</em>, <em>B. penicillata</em> and <em>Ps. fieldi</em>, are abundant and their remains are recorded from several or most dune 'blowout' sites and all are recorded from a substantial cave deposit. These three were members of the original (i.e. immediately pre-European) fauna of Faure Island. <em>Rattus tunneyi</em>, in contrast, is known from a single specimen from a dune blowout, but is not recorded from the cave deposit. It appears unlikely to have been a member of the original fauna, but rather the specimen may be a relict from an earlier fauna, or may have been carried to the island from the mainland by a predator. Comparison with other islands in Shark Bay suggests that, at some 5800 ha in area, Faure Island should have carried more than three mammal species. There is no evidence that the island has been significantly smaller at any time since it was formed by rising sea level about 7000 years ago. A lack of habitat diversity or extremes of temperature or drought may have reduced the number of mammal species over the millenia, or it is just possible that the original fauna may have included other small species with restricted habitat requirements whose remains have not been detected. It is, however, very unlikely that any other medium-sized mammal originally occurred on the Island.

N2  - The currently recorded Faure Island herpetofauna comprises 24 species of reptile. This is a strict subset of the more diverse herpetofauna recorded from adjacent Peron Peninsula. We describe the broader geographic distributions and habitat associations of each species, and discuss the biogeography of the island herpetofauna in the context of the Carnarvon Basin biogeographic region. The reduced island diversity is presumably due to a combination of lesser sampling effort and 'drop out' extinctions following drowning of the continental shelf and severance of the island around 6500 years ago.

This list comprises 69 species of non-passerines and 28 species of passerines. Forty-four species depend almost entirely on the ocean including beaches, mangroves and associated mudflats and tidal samphires for food resources. The landbird fauna is relatively depauperate. Faure Island has significant areas of mud flats for traniequatorial migrant wading birds that are protected by agreements between the government ot Australia and the governments of Japan, China and South Korea. Breeding data for 23 species are presented.

N2  - Feral cats became established on Faure Island during the late 19th century and were probably introduced from pearling vessels or by early pastoralists. The Australian Wildlife Conservancy (AWC), lease holders of the Faure Island pastoral lease, is planning to establish the area as a site for the conservation of threatened mammals. AWC proposes to translocate native mammal species to the island. To enable the successful recolonisation of the island by these species it would be necessary to implement a feral cat eradication program. This paper describes a preliminary feasibility study for the eradication of feral cats from the island.

N2  - One hundred and twenty-one species of marine algae, seagrasses and cyanobacteria are reported from the offshore atolls of northwestern Western Australia (the Rowley Shoals, Scott Reef and Seringapatam Reef). Included are 65 species of Rhodophyta, 40 species of Chlorophyta, nine species of Phaeophyceae, three species of Cyanophyta and four species of seagrasses. This report presents the first detailed account of marine benthic algae from these atolls. Twenty-four species are newly recorded for Western Australia, with four species (<em>Anadyomene wrightii</em>, <em>Rhipilia nigrescens</em>, <em>Ceramium krameri</em> and <em>Zellera tawallina</em>) also newly recorded for Australia.

N2  - A quantitative survey documenting the diversity and abundance of sponges at Mermaid, Scott and Seringapatam Reefs, north Western Australia, was conducted in September 2006. Four reef habitats (fore reef slope, channel, lagoon and intertidal reef flat) were surveyed by recording numbers of sponge individuals on replicate transects, providing baseline data of sponge species present and their abundance. In total 132 sponge species were recorded from these reefs. The majority of the species found (79) were unique to one of the reefs, with only 14 species found at all three reefs. A clear difference in the composition of the sponge assemblages between Mermaid and Scott Reefs was detected, which appears to be strongly influenced by the presence of infrequently recorded (rare) species. Intertidal reef flat habitats had lower species richness than subtidal habitats (&lt;3 species at intertidal stations compared to between 6–21 species at subtidal stations). Channels were distinct from other subtidal habitats and were characterized by high abundances of a few common species. Over half of the species found in the study were rare with 56% having five or fewer individuals recorded from all locations in the study. This is the first documentation of the sponge fauna from these reefs and only the second study to date to examine the sponges found on the oceanic reefs off north Western Australia.

N2  - A diverse assemblage of scleractinian species was recorded during a rapid assessment of the shallow water coral taxa of Mermaid, Scott and Seringapatam Reefs. All taxa were predominately widespread Indo-Pacific species that present clear affinities with coral assemblages of Ashmore Reef and the Indonesian provinces to the north. A total of 269 scleractinian species from 57 genera in 14 families were recorded, comprised of 211 species at Mermaid Reef, 224 species at South Scott Reef, 201 species at North Scott, and 159 species at Seringapatam. The study yielded 22 new distribution records for Mermaid Reef, 18 new distribution records for Scott-Seringapatam, one new record for Western Australia (<em>Fungia moluccensis)</em>, and one new record for the Rowley-Scott region (<em>Montipora digitata,</em> previously recorded from Ashmore Reef). Multivariate analyses indicated there were distinct communities within and among reefs associated with the reef front, lagoon, and intertidal reef flat habitats.

N2  - The atolls on the north-western Australian continental shelf are recognised in having a diverse shallow-water fauna with many widely distributed Indo-West Pacific species. However, the crustaceans of these reefs are poorly known. A survey of the crustaceans of four of the reefs on these continental-shelf atolls (Mermaid, South and North Scott, and Seringapatam reefs) was conducted in 2006 by the Western Australian Museum, Perth. Identifications focused on the stomatopod and decapod crustaceans, although many species within these groups such as the galatheids, caridean shrimps, and stomatopods, are not yet fully identified. A total of 157 species were recorded, more than doubling the numbers of species previously recorded from these atolls. The number of species will increase with identification of the unidentified specimens. The Xanthidae (Brachyura) was the most diverse family at all reefs, which is typical of Australian coastal waters. Differences in the stomatopods and decapod assemblages among reefs and respective habitats are discussed.

N2  - A survey documenting the diversity and indicative abundance of targeted echinoderms (asteroids, echinoids and holothurians) at Mermaid, Scott and Seringapatam Reefs was conducted in September 2006. Due to logistical constraints species were counted along a single transect furnishing limited scope for statistical analysis. Echinoderms (including some ophiuroids) were collected opportunistically at each station. Fourteen species of echinoderm were collected from the NW atolls for the first time (five species of Asteroidea including a possible new species, six Ophiuroidea and three Echinodea). Voucher specimens of all but the commonest species have been lodged with the Western Australian Museum. The echinoderm fauna of Scott Reef, particularly North Scott Reef, has declined in abundance and species richness since the surveys of the 1980s. This may have been influenced by a significant coral bleaching event in 1998 and subsequent scouring by cyclonic activity. Fishing pressure at South and North Scott Reefs (but not Mermaid Reef) by Indonesian fishers has also had a drastic effect on holothurian populations to the point where oligospermy will be a serious factor.

N2  - The biodiversity of fishes on the Australian North West Shelf atolls is known to be the richest in the state. In recent years however, there has been minimal focus on comprehensive taxonomic fish surveys in this region. Since the atolls are subjected to an increasing frequency of pressures such as major cyclones, coral bleaching, tourism, fishing and natural resource exploitation, it is critical to monitor this region to have the information to safeguard the biodiversity for the future.

N2  - We describe the origins, relevance, aims, specifications and sampling strategy of a six-year biodiversity survey of Western Australia's Pilbara biogeographic region (179,000 km2). During the project, 422 terrestrial sites were sampled for perennial and annual vascular plants, of which 304 were also sampled for small ground-dwelling mammals, birds, reptiles, frogs, ground-dwelling spiders, ants, beetles and scorpions. Ninety-eight sites on waterbodies were sampled for aquatic invertebrates, macro- and microphytes and the fringing riparian vegetation; 508 boreholes were sampled for stygofauna; 69 sites were sampled for microbats; and mammal bone material from 15 late Holocene deposits was identifi ed. An introduction to literature on the region's physical environments and recent land-use history is provided, along with descriptions of the Pilbara's four sub-regions in terms of their different landforms and vegetations.

N2  - Small (&lt; 50 g) ground-dwelling mammals were sampled as a part of a larger survey of the Pilbara biogeographic region in Western Australia. Environmental attributes infl uencing the probability of occurrence of individual small mammal species were identifi ed using the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) modelling approach. Interpretation of co-occurrence patterns, based on known habitat associations throughout wider ranges in the Pilbara and/or elsewhere in Australia, was used to facilitate comparisons of sub-sets of the species models. Eighteen species were recorded during this study (mean of 3.4 per survey site [range: 0–7]), but only 14 had suffi cient survey records to construct models with reasonable certainty. Complex, non-linear responses were observed for most of the MARS species models, with model performance higher for species with a restricted distribution than the more widely ranging species. Species co-occurrence patterns appeared to be best explained by substrate with three alignments linking species that tend to occur on increasingly sandy, clayey and rocky substrates. Similarly, variables describing the substrate were consistently and strongly represented in the models, indicating that these mammals partition their habitat on substrate type at the local scale in the Pilbara. Climate attributes added little information to the models, although distance to the coast, a surrogate for a range of climatic infl uences, was important for some species. That all species previously known to occur in this region were recorded in the current study suggests that this fauna is still intact, despite a variety of factors (e.g. pastoralism, weed invasion, inappropriate fi re regimes and mining) that have been transforming the region's ecology for more than a century.

N2  - Between 2004 and 2007, we systematically surveyed microbats across the Pilbara region in Western Australia, and collected data on species' foraging ecology. Here we report the results of the echolocation survey of 69 sites dispersed among 24 survey areas covering the 179,000 km2 region. Echolocation call sequences were identified using a library of known calls accumulated during field work. In combination, the frequency maintained for the greatest number of cycles (<em>FpeakC</em>) and the bandwidth ratio of this peak (<em>Q</em>) identified search-mode echolocation calls by 13 of the 17 species comprising the microbat fauna of the Pilbara bioregion. These variables did not separate<em> Taphozous georgianus</em> from <em>T. hilli </em>calls, <em>Chalinolobus gouldii</em> from <em>Mormopterus loriae</em>, and allopatric pairs of <em>Nyctophilus</em> species. Even so, the spectral characters provided an ecologically informative, viable and non-intrusive survey tool.

N2  - Ground-dwelling spiders were sampled at 304 quadrats in 24 survey areas chosen to represent the geographical extent and diversity of terrestrial environments in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, an area of approximately 179,000 km2. Only taxa that were primarily ground-dwelling and were taxonomically robust were identifi ed to species level. A total of 375 species comprising 14 families was recorded. The families Salticidae (93 species), Zodariidae (71 species) and Oonopidae (70 species) showed marked species-level radiation. After excluding quadrats that were burnt or flooded during the sampling period, the distribution data of 375 species from 294 quadrats were analysed, with an average of 12.9 (<em>SD</em> = 6.8) species per quadrat. Singletons (species recorded at only one quadrat) constituted 26% (98 species) of the total number of species, and were found more frequently in the Roebourne and Fortescue subregions. Species assemblages were indistinct at the quadrat level, but signifi cant clustering occurred when the data were pooled into the 24 survey areas. The arrangement of the survey areas on an MDS ordination plot was analogous with their spatial positions on a map, in particular the division into a northern and southern Pilbara with the Fortescue cluster running in between. This division was also evident with a number of strong allopatric species distributions. The separation of the survey area clusters was correlated with variation in annual precipitation, latitude and dry season precipitation. Given the sporadic nature of rain events in the Pilbara bioregion and the limitations of the climatic data, however, some caution is advised in interpreting these results.

N2  - The Pilbara region of Western Australia is an arid zone with an abundance of wetlands, ranging from springs and river pools to salt marshes, claypans, rockpools and gnammas. The Pilbara is also rich in mineral resources, which are being heavily exploited, and most of the region is under pastoral lease, with both land uses potentially having an impact upon aquatic systems. In order to provide information for improved conservation planning, including environmental impact assessment and reserve system design, a survey of wetland fauna was undertaken as part of a broader biodiversity survey of the region. This paper describes patterns in the distribution of the region's aquatic invertebrate diversity and identifies environmental correlates of those patterns. Invertebrates and environmental variables were surveyed at 100 wetlands in spring and autumn between 2003 and 2006. The Pilbara appears to have a particularly diverse fauna for an arid zone, with just over 1000 species collected, an average of 94 species per sample and a maximum sample richness of 226 species. About a fi fth of the fauna is known to date only from the Pilbara. The remaining species are western endemics, occur elsewhere in northern and/or inland Australia, or have continental or wider distributions. Most species seem to be widespread in the Pilbara region but rare and/or restricted elements are present, especially in some permanently flowing springs, including those in Millstream and Karijini National Parks, and in ephemeral wetlands such as Fortescue Marsh and freshwater claypans. Faunal composition was not strongly correlated with season, drainage divides, stream order or previously recognised bioregional boundaries. A number of assemblages of species with common patterns of occurrence were identified, each showing unique associations with measured environmental variables. Flow, turbidity, salinity, sediments, macrophytes and hydrological persistence are among the environmental gradients most strongly correlated with occurrence patterns in the fauna.

N2  - We sampled scorpions in a systematic survey of 294 sites representing the major landform types across the arid Pilbara region of north-western Australia, an area of ca. 179,000 km2. We trapped two species of <em>Isometroides</em>, 10 of <em>Lychas </em>and 10 of <em>Urodacus</em>. All species were undescribed except one (<em>U. megamastigus</em>). Patterns of occurrence were similar to those found previously in arid Western Australia, in that temperature and soil characteristics seem to infl uence scorpion distributions; however, there were only weak correlations between species richness and sandiness of the soil, water availability, and annual temperature. In a classification of the sample sites based on occurrence of scorpion species, the major division in the dendrogram was associated with topographic and soil variables, while annual temperature, soil depth, ruggedness, total K and the presence of <em>Acacia</em> species were the fi ve variables (of the 25 available) providing the best fit with the site matrix. Much more information about the biology and ecology of individual species will be needed in order to interpret these patterns confi dently.

N2  - The Pilbara region has one of the most diverse reptile assemblages in the world and includes many typical arid zone species as well as many saxicoline endemics. We present the results of a four-year survey of the region during which pitfall trap lines were used to sample 297 quadrats for a total of two weeks in spring and in autumn. The quadrats were located across the region and were chosen to sample the main substrate types. Environmental variables were measured to characterise the soil as well as the geomorphic, vegetative and climatic setting of each quadrat. We used the program PATN to expose patterns in species composition among quadrats, and in relation to the environmental variables.

N2  - The geographic range, status and breeding season are documented for 325 bird species known to occur in the Pilbara, Western Australia, since the first records were made in 1699. The fauna is a mixture of Torresian, Eyrean and Bassian components, along with a variety of seabirds, migratory wading birds and Asian vagrants. The region lies entirely within the arid zone and the overall harshness of the environment means that few species are resident. The richness of the total avifauna (resident and non-resident) is due mainly to the diversity of habitats, especially those on or near the coast. The region is an important refugial destination for a variety of Australian species and includes a range of endemic subspecies and colour morphs. The area from Eighty Mile Beach to Port Hedland saltworks is of international importance for shorebirds and, following cyclonic rains, Mandora Marsh and Fortescue Marsh are of continental importance for waterbirds. The 204 breeding species are mapped, and each species is assessed for possible changes in distribution or abundance since 1900.

N2  - A survey of riparian flora and plant communities was undertaken at 98 wetlands and rivers in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Sampling was quadrat-based, with fl oristics, surface soils and wetland attributes recorded. Selected sites captured the full range of Pilbara wetland types including springs, river pools, claypans, salt marshes and rock pools. A total of 455 taxa was recorded from the survey sites, representing ca. 25% of the known fl ora of the Pilbara bioregion. The fl ora is dominated by taxa with Eremaean and tropical affi nities, with only six taxa endemic in the region. Of recorded taxa known from four or fewer bioregions, most are shared with the adjacent Carnarvon and Gascoyne bioregions rather than the adjoining internally draining deserts. Sixteen taxa of conservation signifi cance were documented, with claypans, the Fortescue Marsh, and Millstream and Karijini National Park sites dominating occurrences of rare species. Eight major groups were defined by classifying wetlands in terms of species presence/absence data. Floristic patterning was strongly aligned with the major wetland types (geomorphic/hydrological) used in the primary sampling stratifi cation. A combination of wetland morphology/hydrological setting, site edaphic attributes and distance to the coast were dominant variables related to riparian floristic composition. Primary compositional separation was observed between riverine and non-riverine sites, with lowland turbid riverine sites with finetextured soils compositionally related to claypans and clay flats. Limited biogeographic patterning was evident except where individual IBRA subregions and drainage basins were dominated by few wetland types.

N2  - A biological survey of the Pilbara biogeographic region was undertaken between 2002 and 2007 to provide a regional perspective on biodiversity patterns as a contribution to nature conservation planning. During this survey, 304 sites were sampled for small ground-dwelling mammals, birds, reptiles, spiders, ants, beetles and scorpions. A further 98 sites were sampled for wetland invertebrates, aquatic macrophytes and fringing riparian vegetation. Data for these two groups of sites were aggregated separately (i.e. terrestrial fauna and wetland biodiversity) and models of turnover in species composition within each data set were developed using generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM). A wide range of environmental variables was assessed as predictors of compositional turnover – biotic (vegetation cover indices), climate, landform, hydrologic, regolith (soil and geology) and geographic distance. Generally, predictors associated with regolith were the most strongly supported in both the terrestrial fauna and wetland biodiversity models, followed by combined landform/ hydrologic variables, then climate/biotic variables. Geographic distance between sites was retained in the terrestrial fauna model only. The fi nal GDM models explained 46.1% and 58.5% of the deviance in the compositional turnover of terrestrial fauna and wetland biodiversity, respectively. Spatial representation of the coverage of survey sites showed that a large proportion of the core study area was well represented for both terrestrial fauna and wetland biodiversity. However, gaps in the proportional representation of both groups within the 2011 conservation reserve system were evident, particularly in the coastal region of the Pilbara (Roebourne subregion) and the Fortescue River valley (Fortescue subregion). With the addition of proposed reserves (in 2015) within these two subregions, the representation of terrestrial fauna and wetland biodiversity was substantially improved.

N2  - At the time of European invasion the Aboriginal people of the Swan Coastal Plain were engaged in a complex series of social economic and ceremonial networks which required regular faceto- face gatherings. The annual winter meeting at Barragup on the Serpentine River appears to have been one of the most important of these events, sustained by the operation of a wooden mungah fi shtrap which allowed harvesting of sea mullet (<em>Mugil cephalus</em>) and Australian salmon (<em>Arripis truttaceus</em>). This paper provides historical material on the nature and operation of the Barragup mungah and the associated gathering as part of an appreciation of the research of the ethnohistorical research by Sylvia Hallam.

N2  - Since the early 1970s the petroglyphs of the Dampier Archipelago have been acknowledged for their National and World heritage status. Part of this recognition of significance is the evident antiquity, stylistic variability and abundance of production that the petroglyphs display. It has been suggested that the oldest of these images are in the order of 15,000 to 18,000 years old. Based on only a few dates, coupled with stylistic and weathering patterns, a three-phase art sequence was first put forward in the early 1980s. These identified art phases were defi ned on information collected from just two locations toward the southern end of Dampier Island. This paper presents a more comprehensive temporal structure to the Dampier rock art. Unlike previous studies, which focussed on a restricted survey area, this current study draws on knowledge of a larger and more widely distributed sample of the rock art. The results suggest at least fi ve major art phases spanning some 20 to 30,000 years.

N2  - This paper provides a brief description of a range of Indigenous stone arrangements that do not have an obvious utilitarian function and occur in the South-West and Murchison Regions of Western Australia. There has been relatively little research into stone arrangements in Western Australia and the detailed field recording of the Avon Downs Stone Arrangement made by Sylvia Hallam in 1970 stands out as one of the earliest recordings. As a newly appointed Graduate Assistant with the Department of Aboriginal Sites, Western Australian Museum, I turned Sylvia's field recording into a formal plan in 1973. This project triggered an ongoing interest in stone arrangements that I have intermittently pursued ever since.

N2  - Hallam proposed a four phase chronological sequence to interpret the surface artefact scatters which is the main archaeological site type on the Swan Coastal Plain. The presence of <em>Lupinus</em> seeds and size sorting in the artefact assemblage from excavations at the Bennett Brook site suggested disturbance had resulted from agricultural activity since European settlement. Without the presence of the seeds the disturbance would not have been detected, indicating that more attention should be paid to site formation processes in interpreting and assessing sites in the Perth area.

N2  - Between 1841, when Rottnest Island was proclaimed a legal prison exclusively for Aborigines and the Aborigines Act, 1905, at least 18 Acts and amendments were proclaimed to protect, employ and punish Aboriginal people in Western Australia. This paper considers several of the laws passed after 1870, the manner of policing and sentencing in the northern districts of the colony and the transfer of those convicted under these laws to Rottnest Prison. The application of sentencing laws in the Gascoyne, Upper Gascoyne and Upper Murchison is considered in some detail because in 1884, the number of Rottnest prisoners originating from these districts exceeded the totals from all other districts in the colony. This in turn raises a question whether the number of prisoners originating from these districts may be attributable to an abnormally high rate of criminal acts or to the harsh judgements of those hearing the charges.

Some Australian data, if found in New Guinea, would label those societies as agricultural. I suggest two avenues, residue analysis and historical research, along which research in this matter might usefully continue.

N2  - In this paper we aim to track the intellectual connections between Dr Sylvia Hallam (Sylvia), in her time as a lecturer with the Department of Anthropology at the University of Western Australia, and ourselves, three ex-students and research assistants. Together, our experiences span a period of almost a decade of Sylvia's lecturing years (1973–1981), with numerous other professional and social encounters. In particular, we focus on outlining the influences from Sylvia's work and values brought to our archaeological and cultural heritage work in Tasmania (1984 to present). We emphasise two main influences that we took to Tasmania from Sylvia's teachings – the first a landscape or regional approach to archaeology, and the second a holistic or integrated approach to archaeology that incorporated a wide range of data sources. We note that both regions are rich in historical source materials relating to Aboriginal people and this facilitated the flow of ethnohistorical methods from Western Australia to Tasmania.

N2  - During the voyage of the <em>Beagle</em> (1831–1836) Charles Darwin had the opportunity of describing the societies and ways of life of Australian Aborigines, Tahitians, Maoris, Fuegians, Africans, Chilotans, amongst others. Although Darwin did not fully adopt evolutionary ideas until some months after the end of the voyage, probably in about March 1837, even while aboard HMS <em>Beagle</em> there are signs that he was arranging his observations of humanity around ideas that later became important to him. For example, he speculated about the 'scale' or 'ladder' of human societies from the most primitive to the most advanced; yet he also embraced the idea of the 'human family' and of the relationships among the human groups, and considering the suggestion that there was a common origin as expounded in <em>The Descent of Man </em>in 1871. He also displayed an ecological awareness. Nevertheless Darwin lacked an appropriate conceptual framework for anthropological studies; he sometimes fell back on his medical training at Edinburgh, or on zoological comparisons. Moreover, he was a man of his time, with the view of the world of a young English gentleman, brought up in the Whig tradition, and with a broadly Christian outlook. He believed strongly in Britain's imperial destiny, and the superiority of European civilisation, and some of his remarkably detailed observations have to be interpreted in this light.

N2  - Taxonomic study of the first regional scale collection of deepwater invertebrate megabenthos from Australia's western continental margin reveals a previously undiscovered high species richness and novelty. Benthic samples were taken systematically at 19 sites from Albany to Barrow Island (~35ºS to 21ºS) on the deep continental shelf (100 m depth) and upper continental slope (400 m). At some sites, additional samples were taken across-shelf at depths of 200 m, 700 m and 1000 m, with a couple as deep as 1200 m and 1500 m. Multibeam (swath) mapping of complex seabed topography enabled targeted collection of the epifauna on hard and soft substrates and targetting of features including submarine canyons.

N2  - The Northern Kimberley biogeographic region has been identifi ed as one of Australia's biodiversity hotspots. Although susceptible to many processes threatening biodiversity in adjacent regions, the Northern Kimberley has experienced no known plant or animal extinctions to date. Of particular conservation value are the extensive archipelagos and island groups along its drowned coastline. Collectively, these islands form a microcosm of substrates and vegetation communities widespread on the adjacent mainland, so they are likely to be important refuges for fauna, particularly as they have been largely sheltered from mainland disturbances. In December 2006, a 3-year biodiversity survey of 24 of the islands commenced. The survey was designed to provide the knowledge base to underpin future management actions to protect the biodiversity values of the islands. This survey focused on the species groups believed to be most at risk from threatening processes affecting biodiversity on the mainland. It included mammals, reptiles, frogs, land snails, plants and birds. Here, we describe the background, rationale, objectives and implementation of this survey, including general descriptions of the islands sampled.

N2  - The inshore islands of the northern Kimberley are relatively un-altered examples of the adjacent mainland's substrates and vegetation communities. Being naturally sheltered from many anthropogenic disturbances evident on the mainland, these islands are likely to be important refuges for mammals. A systematic survey of 24 of the largest islands along the northern Kimberley coast revealed the presence of 18 non-volant mammal species (19 species are now known from these islands), most of which fall within the 'critical weight range' of 35 g–5.5 kg. We recorded previously undetected species on a number of islands including two new island populations of each of the threatened species <em>Dasyurus hallucatus, Isoodon auratus</em> and <em>Mesembriomys macrurus</em>, and one new population of the Kimberley endemic <em>Zyzomys woodwardi</em>. The persistence of two other Kimberley endemics on the islands, <em>Petrogale burbidgei </em>and <em>Wyulda squamicaudata </em>was also confirmed. Small mammals (≤35 g) were rarely detected on the islands, with only two small rodents recorded (<em>Pseudomys nanus</em> and <em>P. delicatulus</em>). The most important factor determining mammal species richness was island area, closely followed by distance to the mainland, then proximity to a river mouth. Species composition was related to presence of preferred mainland habitats.

N2  - We investigated patterns in species richness and similarity in species composition of land snail communities in relation to biogeographic and environmental gradients on continental islands along the Kimberley coastline of Western Australia. The camaenid land snails demonstrated high overall species richness, restricted geographical ranges (mostly to a single island) and almost complete turnover of species among islands. In comparison, the overall number of the smaller non-camaenid land snail species was much lower. They also had much wider distributions and a lower level of species turnover among islands. These results are consistent with the differing dispersal abilities of the two groups, one fostering in situ speciation and the other inter-island colonisation. We also show that dispersal ability was not the only driver of species richness and composition of land snail species on islands, but that rainfall, island area and availability of habitat also played a role. Rainfall was the major environmental driver of richness and composition for both groups of land snails. Rainfall was also highly correlated with extent of rainforest cover, habitat that provides a suitable micro-climate for snails and additional ecological niches compared to more open habitats.

N2  - The islands off the Kimberley coastline of northern Western Australia are among Australia's most isolated areas. To date, frogs of the Kimberley islands have been a particularly poorly surveyed group owing to the remoteness of the region and the need to conduct surveys during the summer wet season at night when frogs call and are most active. Here, we report on the results of a three-year survey of frogs on 22 Kimberley islands. We found several broad patterns such as the near-ubiquitous presence of three species on most islands (<em>Limnodynastes lignarius</em>, <em>Litoria staccato</em> and <em>Uperoleia borealis</em>), all of which breed in rocky creeks. In contrast, some species common on the mainland were largely absent from the islands (<em>Litoria bicolor</em>, ground hylids and medium to large burrowing species).

N2  - Our paper describes Aboriginal connections, values and knowledge of the Kimberley islands and their resources in the context of a terrestrial biological survey of 24 islands, initiated by the Western Australian Government and coordinated by the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC). The Kimberley islands represent part of the traditional lands of Aboriginal people in the region and hold great signifi cance and value for them. The Kimberley Land Council (KLC) facilitated the participation of 50 Aboriginal Traditional Owners in this survey, which spanned five Native Title areas, three of which have now been determined (Bardi and Jawi, Wanjina Wunggurr Dambimangari and Wanjina Wunggurr Uunguu) and two of which are still in mediation (Balanggarra and Mayala). The KLC and DEC negotiated a research agreement that provided for managed access to sensitive cultural sites, data sharing, the participation of Traditional Owners in fi eld work alongside scientists and input by Traditional Owners in the fi nal publications and recommendations resulting from this survey. Our paper also places the island survey and its fi ndings into the broader context of Indigenous Natural and Cultural Resource Management (INCRM) in the Kimberley region, including the development of Indigenous Protected Areas and Indigenous Rangers, and other projects such as fi re abatement and tourism management, along with traditional management practices which operate independently from formal management programs.

N2  - A systematic survey of flora and floristic communities was undertaken on 24 selected inshore islands off the Northern Kimberley (NK) coast between 2007 and 2010. One hundred and thirty seven 50 x 50 m quadrats were sampled for floristics and surface soils, and site attributes recorded. Quadrat sampling was supplemented by general collecting to further document the floristics of major substrates and habitats of each island. We recorded 1005 taxa from the surveyed islands, of which, 403 taxa were new records for the collective islands of the NK bioregion. Based on existing Western Australian Herbarium collections and current survey records, the flora recorded from the islands represents approximately 49 percent of the NK bioregion flora. A total of 57 taxa of conservation significance were recorded from the surveyed islands. Few taxa appear to be restricted to islands. Very few weed species were recorded, except from the islands with a modern history of settlement. Ten floristic groups were defi ned by the classifi cation of species presence/absence within quadrats. Broad geology coupled with climate and local edaphic parameters appeared to be the main factors influencing the vegetation patterns observed on the islands sampled. Among quadrats on the hard/ rocky substrates, there was a compositional gradation from the plant communities of the sandstone geologies to the more fertile volcanic/dolerite substrates, which was reflected in the values of the soil parameters. In terms of the conservation signifi cance of the islands as a whole, the largest and wettest islands were shown to be particularly important as they supported the highest number of NK bioregion endemic plant species. Highest numbers of priority taxa also tended to occur on the largest islands. However, some of the drier islands had unique species assemblages with elements of arid/semi-arid zone flora that were not well represented on other islands. Future management of the islands requires strategies that minimize both the risk of exotic weed introductions, and inappropriate fire that would threaten the persistence of fi re-sensitive vegetation.

N2  - Australia's islands play a signifi cant role in the conservation of its biota. The near-pristine islands along the Kimberley coast of north-western Australia are important natural refuges that have been relatively isolated from many of the threatening processes affecting the adjacent mainland. Between 2007 and 2010, 24 of the largest of these islands were surveyed for non-volant mammals, reptiles, birds, frogs, bats, land snails and vascular plants. To facilitate the setting of conservation priorities, I examined congruence in the biogeographic patterns among these taxonomic groups and related those to island-wide attributes. A high level of congruence in both spatial patterns of species richness and community similarity across most of the taxonomic groups was found. Congruence in species richness was best explained by a strong relationship with island area; while congruence in community similarity was infl uenced by the dispersal ability of taxa. Average annual rainfall and the extent of rock scree (or ruggedness) on an island were also strong correlates of both spatial patterns in community similarity and richness of regional endemics. I also show that this pattern was not explained by richness differences of species between islands alone, but largely due to species replacement among islands. These patterns refl ect the greater diversity of regional endemic species and/or habitat specialists that are restricted to the relatively high rainfall and extensively rocky islands; whereas the drier islands typically support widespread generalists that have distributions that extend into the semi-arid and arid zones. In terms of conservation signifi cance, the largest islands in the most mesic section of the coast are important for their high species diversity, including regional endemics. However, the lower rainfall islands support unique assemblages, and some are also important for their threatened mammal species. The high level of island endemism of the camaenid land snails indicates that all the islands sampled are important in terms of representing their diversity. The results of the survey also support the hypothesis that these islands are microcosms of the adjacent Northern Kimberley mainland with 74% of mammal, 59% of reptile, 70% of frog, 69% of bird and 49% of plant species of the Northern Kimberley bioregion now known on the islands sampled. Future management of the islands requires strategies that minimise the risk of incursions by exotic species and appropriate fi re regimes to preserve habitat quality.

N2  - Barrow Island represents a unique island ecosystem off north-western Australia. It has ecological affinities to the Cape Range region of the Australian mainland, and it also supports an oil and gas resource industry. The island hosts a long-unburnt vegetation complex, and a diverse community of vertebrate and invertebrate fauna occupy the disturbed and undisturbed habitats of the island. In the absence of non-indigenous predators or herbivores, without extensive land clearing, and with an instituted level of island quarantine, these environmental values have persisted to make Barrow Island an important environmental asset for Australia, and an example where island ecology functions in the presence of resource extraction. To date, almost 2,800 species of terrestrial and subterranean species have been consistently recorded from Barrow Island. These include 378 native plant species, 13 mammal species (including two species of bats), at least 119 species of terrestrial and migratory birds, 43 species of terrestrial reptiles, one species of frog, three subterranean vertebrates, at least 34 species of subterranean invertebrates, and the most speciose of all, over 2,200 terrestrial invertebrates.

N2  - Chevron has made an important contribution to our knowledge and understanding of the Barrow Island flora and fauna, and to the Australian economy. This knowledge has been primarily founded from the investigations and commitments of joint venture partners associated with the environmental impact assessment for the Gorgon Gas Development. The Gorgon Gas Development is one of the world's largest natural gas projects and the largest single natural gas project in Australia's history. Development has been balanced between energy needs and environmental management. Through plans, procedures, programs and research, Chevron Australia and its joint venture participants have established a benchmark for environmental management of this important island reserve. Furthermore, the Gorgon Joint Ventures have contributed to one of the largest biodiversity offset and Net Conservation Benefit programs in Western Australia.

N2  - Barrow Island is Western Australia's second largest offshore island and its flora and fauna have been able to evolve without major human disturbances. Chevron Australia Pty Ltd and its Joint Venture Participants made an application to construct a plant to liquefy natural gas on the island in 2001. One of the conditions under which approval was granted was the implementation of a rigorous biosecurity effort to ensure that no non-indigenous species (NIS) are introduced or allowed to establish on the island. To fulfil this condition it was first necessary to characterise what was already present on the island. A series of surveys have been performed using a purpose-designed sampling protocol in order to provide baseline data on the existing terrestrial invertebrates on Barrow Island. A total of 1,873 morphospecies were sampled but subsequent surveys and taxonomic developments have increased the count to 2,397. This compares with an estimated species richness of 2,481 terrestrial invertebrate species on the island. Composition of the fauna varied considerably between the wet and dry seasons and between years, even when samples were taken during the same month. Composition also varied with distance from the coast, which may be associated with soil type and vegetation association. Twenty five non-indigenous species and seven putative non-indigenous species have been found, all of which are believed to have been present prior to commencement of the Gorgon Gas Development project.

N2  - The Ministerial conditions for regulatory approval for the Gorgon gas project on Barrow Island included a quarantine surveillance program having detection power of 0.8 for non-indigenous species of terrestrial invertebrates, vertebrates and plants. No method was available for design of such a program, so we developed a new method and designed surveillance systems that were implemented successfully in 2010−11 for the first of four years over the construction period. Here we describe the method and outline the invertebrate surveillance system, after the experience of the first year. We discuss a set of issues that characterised the design problem, which we consider typical of many surveillance applications. We suggest that the method is broadly applicable for objective design of surveillance, for biosecurity and other settings.

N2  - During the years of 2005 to 2007, an extensive baseline study of the Barrow Island invertebrate fauna was conducted. This survey included more than 50 sample sites across the island and multiple collecting techniques were used at each site. Over 14,000 specimens were collected during this survey. Taxonomic specialist who examined this material nominated over 2,000 morphospecies of which about 300 could be placed to species rank. Having done all of this collecting and identification, the question then was how best to access and use this valuable resource. All of the specimens were stored in two institutions in Perth – several thousand kilometres south of Barrow Island. Manual access to these specimens was slow which hindered the decision making processes needed when a suspected non-indigenous species was found on the island. The decision was made to digitise the diagnostic characters for representative of each morphospecies. These images were to be made available through a website called PaDIL (Pests and Diseases Image Library). Each species was to have its own webpage containing at least 4 diagnostic images of each species and all of the species collection points to be displayed on an interactive Google Map. Species, as well as higher ranks, could be queried alone or against sample localities or against Indigenous or Non-Indigenous status. Individual species pages could be opened and comparative images tables could be pre-defined and presented or users could build their own comparative image tables in real time. The development of the Barrow Island PaDIL website made the results of the entire Baseline Study accessible to anyone with a web browser from anywhere with an internet connection. The Barrow Island PaDIL website is a major part of the Quarantine efforts of Chevron on Barrow Island.

N2  - Barrow Island, situated off the north-west Australian coast, is well recognised for its subterranean fauna values. Sampling for both stygobitic and troglobitic fauna has taken place on the island since 1991, and Humphreys (2001) summarised the then current state of knowledge of the island's subterranean fauna. Sampling for impact assessment purposes on the island over the past decade has substantially increased the recorded species richness of Barrow Island. The number of documented stygal taxa has more than doubled since 2001, from 25 to 63 species now known. Troglobitic diversity has also substantially increased, with six species known in 2001 and 19 troglobitic taxa known today. The total recorded subterranean species richness for Barrow Island at this time stands at 82 species. It is likely that considerably more species remain to be recorded, as even the additional surveys of the past decade leave many areas of the island unsampled.

N2  - Three species of camaenid land snails occur on Barrow Island: <em>Quistrachia barrowensis</em> and two previously unassigned species of <em>Rhagada</em>. Based on morphological re-evaluation and analysis of sequences of the mitochondrial gene COI, we have revised the taxonomy of these species, providing a clearer understanding of their geographic distributions and origins. The supposed Barrow Island endemic <em>Q. barrowensis</em> is synonymous with <em>Q. montebelloensis</em> from the Montebello and Lowendal Islands. The small species of <em>Rhagada</em>, confined to the northern tip of Barrow Island, is conspecific with <em>R. plicata</em>, whose distribution also includes the Montebellos and the Lowendals. The large species of <em>Rhagada</em> is described here as <em>R. barrowensis</em> sp. nov., known only from Barrow Island and adjacent Pascoe Island. The three camaenids represent deeply divergent lineages with different geographic origins, indicating that the local diversity on Barrow Island has come about through a complex history. With maximum geographic spans of only 22 to 70 km, the short-range endemism of these species highlights the conservation significance of Barrow Island.

N2  - A new genus of wolf spider (family Lycosidae Sundevall, 1833), <em>Costacosa</em> gen. nov. is described from north-west Western Australia to include <em>C. torbjorni</em> sp. nov. (type species) and <em>C. dondalei</em> sp. nov. The genus belongs to the subfamily Lycosinae Sundevall, 1833 and differs from all other Australian genera in this subfamily with similar somatic morphology, in particular <em>Venator</em> Hogg, 1900 and <em>Knoelle</em> Framenau, 2006, mainly in genitalic characters. The tegular apophysis of the male pedipalp has a pronounced ventral spur, a distinct ventral edge of species-specific shape and serrations along its apical edge. The female epigyne has an elongated triangular atrium and the medium septum is longer than the posterior transverse part. <em>Costacosa</em> are medium-sized wolf spiders of overall brown colouration and with broad light median and sublateral bands on the carapace and a black patch in the frontal two-thirds of the venter. <em>Costacosa</em> <em>torbjorni</em> is the most commonly recorded wolf spider on Barrow Island, from where currently seven species of Lycosidae are known.

N2  - This paper presents an illustrated key to eighteen morphospecies of terrestrial isopods from Barrow Island with a brief summary regarding their currently known distribution and potential endemicity to the island. Six described species are recorded, <em>Ligia</em> <em>exotica</em> (family Ligiidae), <em>Alloniscus</em> <em>pallidulus</em> (Alloniscidae), <em>Laevophiloscia</em> <em>yalgooensis</em> (Philosciidae), <em>Porcellionides</em> <em>pruinosus</em> (Porcellionidae), <em>Barrowdillo</em> <em>pseudopyrgoniscus</em>, <em>Buddelundia</em> <em>hirsuta</em> (both Armadillidae), but the identifications of most need to be confirmed following genus-level revisions and examination of typeor topotypical material. The key includes twelve undescribed species and at least two undescribed genera from the family Armadillidae, one of which is apparently restricted to Barrow Island. Although there is still considerable taxonomic work required to evaluate distributions, it appears that at least six of the eighteen species are potential short-range endemics (SRE).

Lophoturus madecassus is circum-tropical in distribution, <em>Unixenus</em> <em>mjoebergi</em> and <em>Phryssonotus</em> <em>novaehollandiae</em> are found also on mainland Australia, but the other three species are endemic to the island. <em>Speleostrophus</em> <em>nesiotes</em> is a highly modified troglobiotic species, currently listed as threatened by the Western Australian government. It is unclear at present whether the haplodesmid specimen is a troglobite.

N2  - Collembola have been collected from Barrow Island for the first time; a maximum of seventy one species were detected, of which a high proportion are undescribed. Only four nonindigenous species (NIS) species have been collected, three in very small numbers but one was a large population introduced to the island in lengths of timber which were subsequently sent off the island. Despite few of the species being described, most have been collected before and endemism is low. One new genus record for Australia, <em>Calx</em>, was found. The presence of a species of <em>Temeritas</em> is unusual in that the males showed strong sexual dimorphism, and a species of <em>Acanthocyrtus</em> that lacked any pigment was collected in reasonable numbers. Collections from bore holes were rich in species. Five species were recorded only from bore holes and may be island endemics. The intertidal fauna was also rich in species with 14 found, all restricted to this habitat. Soil fauna density of Collembola was found to be high, with a mean average potential density of nearly 47,000/m2. A proportion of the terrestrial Collembola fauna is active under all weather conditions but other species are only active after rain. In general, the terrestrial fauna shows a dominance of the families Isotomidae and Bourletiellidae, which is typical for the wet/dry tropics where trees are absent.

N2  - The hemipteran suborder Auchenorrhyncha comprises a rich assemblage of plant feeding species, many of which are widespread in distribution and act as vectors of viral and fungal diseases affecting plants. Species level identifications in this group generally are possible only by examination of male specimens; prior DNA barcode analyses of a limited range of Auchenorrhyncha indicate that this approach may provide an expedient means to identify species within this diverse group. In this study we explored the utility of DNA barcoding for identification of a wider range of Auchenorrhyncha species than has been examined previously. Diverse fulgoroid (planthopper) and membracoid (leafhopper and allies) Auchenorrhyncha were sampled from Barrow Island, Western Australia, and identified to the least inclusive taxonomic units using morphology. DNA barcodes from 546 adult specimens were obtained and analysed using a General mixed Yule – Coalescent (GMYC) modelling approach to genetically delimit putative species, as a comparison to the morphospecies identifications. Additional DNA barcodes (N = 106) were obtained from nymphs and these were compared to adult DNA barcodes to identify species present among immature specimens.

The fauna comprises 41 species, including three with generic names only, being represented by females or badly damaged males. The following 19 species are newly described: <em>Pseudoparentia canalicula</em> sp. nov., <em>Pseudoparentia niharae</em> sp. nov., <em>Paraclius manglar</em> sp. nov., <em>Medetera junensis</em> sp. nov., <em>Corindia gascoynensis</em> sp. nov., <em>Thinophilus eboricoxa </em>sp. nov., <em>Thinophilus yarraloola</em> sp. nov., <em>Chaetogonopteron capricorne</em> sp. nov., <em>Chaetogonopteron vexillum</em> sp. nov., <em>Sympycnus colliepa </em>sp. nov., <em>Sympycnus lacrimulus</em> sp. nov., <em>Sympycnus pistillus</em> sp. nov., <em>Sympycnus weano</em> sp. nov., <em>Sympycnus ephydroides</em> sp. nov., <em>Sympycnus hamulitarsus </em>sp. nov., <em>Diaphorus karijini </em>sp. nov., <em>Diaphorus garnetensis</em> sp. nov., <em>Chrysotus austrotropicus</em> sp. nov. and <em>Chrysotus pilbarensis</em> sp. nov. <em>Paraclius obtusus</em> Hardy, 1939 is regarded as a new senior synonym of Paraclius albodivisus Parent, 1941, syn. nov. The Pilbara fauna is treated in the context of the wider Australian fauna, and many extralimital records are included. Many Pilbara species are found across tropical northern Australia, and sometimes into adjacent Melanesia. However, some species have a trans-continental distribution south of the monsoonal belt and also occur in central Northern Territory and subtropical interior Queensland suggesting a biogeographic track that now comprises favorable relictual habitats in a largely arid region. The Millstream site along the Fortescue River is particularly rich in species, and it is the only known locality of the isolated monotypic genus <em>Pilbara</em> Bickel.

N2  - This paper examines the species richness and abundance of the Hymenoptera parasitoid assemblage and assesses their potential to provide an indication of the arthropod diversity present in topsoil stockpiles as part of the Topsoil Management Program for Chevron Australia Pty Ltd Barrow Island Gorgon Project. Fifty six emergence trap samples were collected over a two year period (2011 and 2012) from six topsoil stockpiles and neighbouring undisturbed reference sites. An additional reference site that was close to the original source of the topsoil on Barrow Island was also sampled. A total of 14,538 arthropod specimens, representing 22 orders, were collected. A rich and diverse hymenopteran parasitoid assemblage was collected with 579 individuals, representing 155 species from 22 families. The abundance and species richness of parasitoid wasps had a strong positive linear relationship with the abundance of potential host arthropod orders which were found to be higher in stockpile sites compared to their respective neighbouring reference site. The species richness and abundance of new parasitoid wasp species yielded from the relatively small sample area indicates that there are many species on Barrow Island that still remain to be discovered. This study has provided an initial assessment of whether the hymenoptera parasitoid assemblage can give an indication of arthropod diversity. However, further work would still be required to more robustly establish the use of the hymenoptera parasitoid assemblage as indicators of arthropod diversity.

N2  - This work characterises the ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) fauna of Barrow Island, Western Australia, and provides a key to the workers and several unique reproductives of the 117 species recorded from the island thus far. In all, 11 of the 13 subfamilies of Western Australian ants have been recorded from Barrow Island, but Myrmeciinae and Heteroponerinae are absent. At a generic level, the fauna of the island is less rich, holding 36 of the 71 genera currently known from Western Australia. The ant fauna is characteristic of the Eremaean Botanical Province of the Pilbara, rather than that of the Carnarvon Basin from which Barrow Island is geologically derived. Ninety-three ant species (79.5% of the total on Barrow Island) are shared with the ant fauna of the Pilbara region on the adjoining mainland, but only 52 species (44.4% of the total) are shared with the ant fauna of the Carnarvon Basin. The island is very rich in unspecialised and thermophilic ant species. Five such genera, i.e., <em>Iridomyrmex</em> (14 spp.), <em>Monomorium</em> (13 spp.), <em>Polyrhachis</em> (12 spp.), <em>Melophorus</em> (10 spp.), and <em>Camponotus</em> (nine spp.) make up almost 50% (i.e., 49.6%) of the island's ant fauna. Very few ants appear to be endemic to Barrow Island. The relative proportions of the two major subfamilies (Formicinae and Myrmicinae, together comprising 61.5% of the total ant richness) are similar to the proportions found in the South-west Botanical Division for these two subfamilies (i.e., 65.9%), with Barrow Island having a slightly lower ratio of formicines to myrmicines than is found in the south-west of the state. An estimate of the total number of ant species likely to occur on Barrow Island, using the Estimate-S program (Colwell 2009), suggests that a maximum of fourteen additional species may be as yet unrecorded.

N2  - The remote tropical Kimberley region of Western Australia is introduced, its physical marine environment, habitats and classifi cation into bioregions are described, and its marine science history is summarised. An introduction to the ongoing Western Australian Museum marine biological survey program and its objectives are also provided. The geology, metocean conditions and climate of the region are summarised. A primary division of the Kimberley coastline is noted with a northern section dominated by Proterozoic meta-sedimentary and igneous rocks (Kimberley and Bonaparte Gulf Bioregions) and a southern section dominated by Mesozoic and Cainozoic sedimentary rocks (King Sound and Canning Bioregions). In the former section inner shelf seabed sediments overlying the inundated Yampi Plateau are principally of terrestrial origin while in the Canning Bioregion they are principally marine carbonates. On the middle and outer shelf (Oceanic Shoals and North West Shelf Bioregions) sediments are primarily marine carbonates. Along the shelf margin the water is clear and oligotrophic and subject to the Indonesian Through Flow current that originates in the western Pacific. The coastal zone is macrotidal, currents are predominantly tide driven and the coastal water is turbid and probably nutrient rich. These environmental differences and the different connectivity regimes account for distinctive offshore and coastal reef communities.

N2  - The Kimberley region is currently undergoing substantial growth in industrial and general human use. The region is recognised as relatively pristine with a high diversity of habitats and species, but there is little published information on the marine biodiversity. Australian museums and herbaria are the repositories of species diversity datasets and voucher specimens collected over many decades (1880s to present). We have collated data on marine plants, sponges, cnidarians (predominately hard and soft corals), free living worms (predominately polychaetes), crustaceans, molluscs, echinoderms, brachiopods, ascidians and fishes from five Australian natural science collections. We identified &gt;50,000 specimen records of approximately 6,000 shallow water marine species from the Project Area. The scope and methods adopted for this project are outlined here.

N2  - Here, we document 308 species of marine flora from the Kimberley region of Western Australia based on collections held in the Western Australian Herbarium and on reports on marine biodiversity surveys to the region. Included are 12 species of seagrasses, 18 species of mangrove and 278 species of marine algae. Seagrasses and mangroves in the region have been comparatively well surveyed and their taxonomy is stable, so it is unlikely that further species will be recorded. However, the marine algae have been collected and documented only more recently and it is estimated that further surveys will increase the number of recorded species to over 400. The bulk of the marine flora comprised widespread Indo-West Pacifi c species, but there were also many endemic species with more endemics reported from the inshore areas than the offshore atolls. This number also will increase with the description of new species from the region. Collecting across the region has been highly variable due to the remote location, logistical difficulties and resource limitations. Consequently, large portions of the region remain inadequately sampled, and within the Western Australian Herbarium collections much material awaits identifi cation.

Just under 40% of the collected data were excluded from the synthesis described here due to insufficient species identifications, however 342 species of sponges are documented. This dataset provides baseline information for future sponge investigations in the region. The majority of the known species were widespread Indo-Pacific with a number of Australian endemics. Collection effort was biased to offshore locations. Comprehensive surveys of inshore marine habitats will provide a greater understanding of sponge diversity and abundance throughout the entire region.

N2  - The Kimberley region is a vast resource-rich area with huge conservation values. In terms of its marine resources, knowledge of soft coral biodiversity is rudimentary. An extensive data compilation of Kimberley octocoral species housed in three Australian natural science collections was undertaken by the Western Australian Museum. This historic species diversity dataset provides baseline knowledge for ongoing and future soft coral investigations in the region. Nearly 80% of the data was excluded from the present study due to insufficient identification of the collections, with a total of only 63 species being recognised. Based on this limited dataset the overall fauna composition was found to be typical of coral reefs throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific region at shallow depths. More comprehensive taxonomic resolution of existing collections and more extensive surveys of marine habitats in the Kimberley region are necessary to gain a clearer understanding of soft coral biodiversity and abundance, and the uniqueness or commonality of these marine genetic resources within the context of the Indo-Pacific marine fauna.

N2  - Limited information is publicly available about the coral fauna of the Kimberley region, particularly of the inshore coastal communities, and this greatly inhibits species conservation efforts. Nevertheless, sporadic coral collection events have occurred in the Kimberley over the last century, so it is important that these historical data are consolidated and made accessible. Biodiversity loss among reef corals poses a significant threat to the function and dynamics of coral reef ecosystems and to the global economy. To maximise the likelihood that coral diversity can be protected in the long term it is imperative that regional biodiversity baselines are established. Here we synthesise the existing records of shallow water (&lt;30 m) scleractinian coral species in the Kimberley region, which are verified by specimens lodged in Australian museum collections (1880s–2009). Based on 2,420 specimen based records, collected from 70 locations, a total of 338 species of hard corals belonging to 17 families and 71 genera has been identified from Kimberley material. There are pronounced cross shelf differences in species composition with 27 species (8%) recorded only from inshore locations and 111 species (33%) recorded only at offshore locations. The inshore Kimberley coral communities are of great regional and national significance for numerous reasons, including their high diversity, inherent tolerance of harsh environmental conditions, and the opportunities they present for examining the biology and ecology of corals in the absence of anthropogenic disturbance.

N2  - We examined all the previously published records of polychaetes from the Kimberley Project Area as well as unpublished records from Australian museum records and updated any recent nomenclatural changes. Over 260 species from 43 families have been reported and we suggest that this number will increase considerably as more survey work is carried out in the area and additional habitats such as soft sediments are properly surveyed. At this stage many of these species appear to have wide distributions with few endemic species recorded, but we anticipate this will increase with taxonomic revisions incorporating both molecular and morphological techniques. We hope this paper will advertise the availability of this material to specialists for incorporation into their Australian revisions.

N2  - Museum databases contain vast amounts of information that can help understand species distributions, patterns of biodiversity, taxonomic issues, evolutionary relationships and the effects of anthropogenic changes such as climate change. The marine waters of the Kimberley region in north-west Australia are among the least impacted marine ecosystems in the world, so there is a need to compile the extensive museum records for the region and make them more widely accessible. Here, we synthesise records of shallow water marine fish species in the Kimberley collected between 1880 and 2009. Based on 8,326 specimen-based records and thousands of reliable visual records from some 123 broad localities, a total of 1,475 species from 135 families were identified. Pronounced cross continental shelf differences in the fish communities exist with only 20% of species common to both inshore and offshore locales. Offshore atolls have very high species diversity, typifi ed by wide ranging Indo-West Pacific species. In contrast, inshore reefs have lower diversity but support a much higher proportion of endemic species. The marine communities of the Kimberley face increasing pressure from resource development, fishing and tourism, so continued biodiversity and taxonomic research is essential to inform management decisions.

N2  - Australian state museums contain extensive species data and can provide baseline biodiversity information for many areas. We collated the specimen records from the Kimberley region of Australia and found 382 shallow water (&lt;30 m) echinoderm species, comparable to available estimates of species richness from adjacent regions such as the Pilbara, 'Coral Triangle' or Great Barrier Reef. We identify and discuss taxonomic and collecting gaps, cross shelf patterns in species richness and composition, biogeography, and suggest some areas for future research on echinoderms in the region. At most locations, echinoderms have been incompletely sampled and many taxonomic gaps are apparent. Sampling to date has focused on hard substrates, yet there are extensive soft sediment areas in the region. More collections have occurred at inshore reefs and islands, which are more numerous, than at offshore atolls. Cumulative species richness is higher inshore than offshore, but at most inshore locations species richness is lower than offshore. However, this is biased by more collections having occurred intertidally inshore compared to subtidally offshore and much remains to be discovered about the inshore subtidal echinoderm fauna. Five times more endemic species are recorded inshore than offshore, with conservation implications. Further work is needed to identify specimens in existing collections.

N2  - Using biological collections and relevant literature, an extensive data compilation of the marine crustaceans known from the Kimberley Project Area waters has been assembled. This will contribute to the ecological and environmental understanding of the region. Crustacean records held by Australian museums were surveyed for specimens collected in depths of &lt;30 m from the Kimberley coast and adjacent offshore atolls of Western Australia. A total of 5,399 specimen lots were collated, but 28% of records were excluded owing to incomplete identification, leaving 882 species in the final dataset. Decapods represent 85.5% of all crustacean species presently known from the Kimberley Project Area. Most species (64.6%) were wide ranging Indo-West Pacific, with few Australian endemics (13.3%). However, endemism rates were higher in the inshore (17.3%) than in offshore waters (4.7%). Knowledge gaps regarding the crustacean diversity of the region are discussed and shown to be mainly due to collecting bias and variation in effort.

This series of papers, which synthesise species level data accumulated by Australian museums to December 2008, serves as a baseline for future biodiversity surveys and to assist with future management decisions. This present paper deals with the molluscs of the classes Polyplacophora, Gastropoda, Bivalvia, Scaphopoda and Cephalopoda. The molluscs, the most numerically diverse of all of the groups analysed in the Project Area, comprise a total of 1,784 species. Given that (a) the present collation is tightly constrained in terms of locations sampled, depth ranges, dates and institutional databases, (b) there are many undersampled groups (perhaps the majority of families), and (c) the rate of species discovery for molluscs within the Project Area is rising at a rate of approximately 18% per year (according to two independent analyses outlined herein), it is predicted that the eventual total for the Project Area will exceed 5000 species. The molluscan fauna of the Project Area is almost entirely tropical in composition with almost no attenuation of numerical diversity southward, either inshore or offshore. Neither does any pronounced difference exist in numerical diversity across the shelf, despite only 25.32% of species being common to both inshore and offshore locales; the low percentage probably being due to inadequate sampling. A total of 183 species (10.28%) is endemic to Australian waters, with the majority of these endemics (9.32%) occurring only at inshore localities.
