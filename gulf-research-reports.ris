N2  - The study of marine life of the Gulf of Mexico has progressed slowly as compared to other regions of the United States. Much of this lack of progress is probably due to the absence of universities in the coastal area, and the absence of large populated centers where marine research would be encouraged. The early work was done by travelers and expeditions from places remote to the Gulf. Only in the present century has there been any attempt to establish marine laboratories on this seaside. Most of these laboratories have been located in rather remote, inaccessible places, and have usually suffered from inattention by the parent institution. In recent years, however, the search for oil, industrial growth of coastal cities, and the development of beach resorts have brought new roads and more people to the coast. During the same time the Gulf fishing industry expanded enormously, and, in value, became the largest fishery of the several important fishing regions of the United States. For instance, according to Fisheries Industries of the United States for 1956, the Gulf coast produced more in pounds and value than the Pacific coast, and more in value than the New England states. This new growth has stimulated a demand for more scientific knowledge of the Gulf and its waters. The scientific study of the Mollusca of the Gulf of Mexico has been carried on in the past in museums far from this region. The bulk of this work has dealt mainly with taxonomy, and even the geographical distribution of most species is poorly known. The writer’s purpose in the present work is to give a brief history of prior work on Mollusca along the Mississippi coast, to identify the species found in the area studied, and to discuss what is known of the distribution, abundance, and habits of many of the species. The work was done at the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, and was carried on concurrently while the writer was engaged in other duties and activities. Most of the specimens were collected near the Laboratory or around Horn and Ship Islands, but both ends of Mississippi Sound received attention, and it is believed that the collections are representative of the entire area. The writer did not attempt to work in fresh water, and limited the marine collections to the area inside a line drawn one mile south of the barrier

N2  - From 26 February 1944 until 4 February 1945, I was stationed with the U. S. Army on Horn Island, Mississippi, and decided to observe and record the animals and plants existing there. At the time, it seemed that little attention had been devoted to the wildlife of this island, but eventually it became apparent that some studies had been made. However, many of the observations have not been published and many of the records of the flora and fauna living on and around the island are scattered and unavailable. The most outstanding papers include those of Lloyd and Tracy (1901), Lowe (1921), and Pessin and Burleigh (1941). Cook (1942, 1943 a and b) described several of the animals observed. Smith and List (1955) recorded a number of amphibians and reptiles which were collected on Horn Island. Since 1945 more attention has been paid to this subject. Kopman (1946) enlightened the public regarding the seasonal activity of the animals and changing conditions in the Mississippi Sound region in his delightful “Wild Acres,” a book of the Gulf Coast country. From 1940 on many scientists and students of the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory visited Horn Island, but still comparatively little has been published. Rings and Richmond (1953) presented a brief survey on the mosquitoes collected by them during 1944 and 1945; the species listed by them, together with two additional ones, are included in this paper. The animals and plants actually collected or observed on Horn Island are listed in Part IV. Besides those collected by myself, species reported by other investigators are included. Longer study and more intensive collecting would doubtless result in many additions to the fauna and flora as known at present.

N2  - Penaeid shrimp are of special interest to zoologists for several reasons, one being the fact that they are unique among the decapod Crustacea in having a nauplius larval stage, which is otherwise found only in lower groups. The shrimp catch of the south Atlantic and Gulf coasts in 1360 amounted to one-fifth of the total value of all fishery products of the United States (Power, 1961), and the shrimp fishery is the most valuable one in the country. The catch depends almost wholly upon three species, Penaeus aztecus Ives, P. duorarum Burkenroad and P. setiferus (Linnaeus) , according to current usage. Up to about fifteen years ago the whole fishery depended upon the latter species, the North American white Because of their commercial importance, the penaeid shrimp are being studied increasingly in the Americas and other parts of the world. The literature, museum records and certain other information show that the name Penaeaeus setiferus has been misapplied for the past twenty-six years. The matter should be rectified now rather than later. The questions involved depend upon established rules of zoological nomenclature. The following account will be easily understood if it is remembered that there are two species of Atlantic American white shrimp. This fact was ascertained by Burkenroad (1936) and prior to that time all workers assumed that there was only one species, which was referred to uniformly as Pelzaelcs setiferus (Linnaeus). The northern species has been recorded only from the continent of North America. The southern species has been recorded throughout much of the West Indies and the east coasts of Middle and South America to southern Brazil.

N2  - Dr. Gordon Gunter, who sent me the manuscript of his paper “Specific Names of the Atlantic American White Shrimp (Family Penaeidae)” for comment was so kind to allow me to have my reactions to it published simultaneously with it. Unfortunately I cannot agree with Doctor Gunter’s views on the scientific names that should be used for the two Atlantic species of White Shrimp. In the first place I believe that Doctor Gunter’s suggestion that the northern species should be known at Penaeus fluviatilis Say and the southern as P. setiferus (L.) instead of respectively P. setiferus (L.) and P. schmitti Burkenroad, is not in accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Second I believe it against the interest of stability and uniformity of nomenclature to switch a well-known name from one economically important species to another, as this will inevitably lead to serious confusion, and will especially cause difficulties to non-taxonomists.

N2  - Because the early biologists did not see decapod larvae “in the act” of changing from one phase to another due to the fact that they were parts of planktonic collections and their parentage was unknown, each phase was given a generic and specific name of its own. Gurney (1921) did not concur with this practice, but was of the opinion that it is more profitable to assign larvae to definite genera or families, even if the reference proved to be wrong. The chief difficulty encountered in rearing decapod larvae is the maintenance of a constant supply of suitable living food (Needham, 1959). The early embryonic studies of brachyuran crustaceans did not reveal complete life histories. This was due primarily to the lack of effective culture techniques. Birge (1883) gave no details of his culture methods in the study of the development of Panopeus sayi (Smith). Hyman (1925) gave no account of an attempt to culture larvae of xanthid crabs. In recent years the use of definite diets for the larvae has resulted in a knowledge of complete life histories. Knudsen (1959) used Artemia nauplii in feeding larvae of four xanthid crabs of the California coast. Chamberlain (1961) used various combinations of Artemia nauplii and two species of algae to feed larvae of three xanthid crabs of the North Carolina coast. His best results were with a diet of Artemia alone. Former studies of brachyuran embryology at the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory were confined to the description of larvae taken in planktonic collections at or near the surface. Advanced larval forms are not found in such collections. It seldom happens that in planktonic material a series of stages of the same larvae is taken which is sufficiently complete to enable the genus to be determined. The remainder must be identified as nearly as possible by reference to published descriptions of larvae whose parentage is known, and such identification must in many cases be very speculative. Hyman (1925) described a prezoeal, four zoeal and a megalops stage of Neopanope texana sayi (Smith) at Beaufort, North Carolina. Also in his studies is a description of a prezoeal and the first zoeal stage of Eurypanopeus depressus (Smith). Knudsen (1958, 1959, 1960) described culture methods and four zoeal stages and a megalops stage of four species of xanthid crabs from California. Prezoeae were described for two of these species. Chamberlain (1961) described culture methods and

N2  - This study concerns the ecological habits of living Foraminifera from a shallow Louisiana coastal bay during a period of ten months. It is a part of an extensive study undertaken by the Coastal Studies Institute of Louisiana State University to determine the effect of chemical and physical properties of water upon marine life in a large, open bay over an extended period of time. Samples were collected monthly from established locations for the chemical, biological and foraminiferal determinations. Results of the chemical and biological studies will be published by the respective investigators in subsequent papers. The period of time covered by this portion of the study extended from January 1957 to October 1957. Unfortunately, the chemical and biological studies of the bay ended July 1957. Various chemical determinations which were considered pertinent to the study were continued by the investigator throughout the remaining time. Physical influences, such as geomorphology, hydrography and climate, are presented in this paper to help determine exactly what effects each had upon the living Foraminifera of the bay. The chemical data of the bottom waters, presented in Tables 20 to 29, are principally the results of the concurrent chemical study of the bay.

Expansion of that program to include the work of the present biological investigation was authorized by the Chief of Engineers on June 12, 1956. The scope and purpose of this biological work was to: (a) review the history of the St. Lucie Canal and analyze the problems concerned with discharges of fresh water into the St. Lucie Estuary: (b) present biological data from a 2-year investigation of estuarine conditions, January 1957 to January 1959; (c) determine the biological effects of operation of St. Lucie Lock and Dam with reference to important indicator species and evaluate the wide range of claimed damages relative thereto: and (d) determine operational procedures, practicable within the specific operational requirements of the project, which would either be beneficial or of the least damage to estuarine fishes and fishing conditions. A report (Gunter, 1959) covering all sections of the work, but with particular reference to (c) and (d) was submitted to the Jacksonville District of the Corps of Engineers. The present paper covers enough of (a) to give a background for exposition of the biological work and gives an expanded presentation of the biological data.

N2  - This bibliography was originally intended as an adjunct to the author&#039;s current studies of anomalies in marine fish populations. A number of recent notes have shown, however, that present workers are largely unfamiliar with the rather extensive literature on fish teratology in respect to both particular anomalies and their previous recognition in a species or other taxon. There is an evident need for a compilation of the literature and it is hoped that the present work will fulfill its purpose by facilitating current and future studies in this important area of ichthyology. Standard bibliographical and abstracting sources such as Dean&#039;s , "Bibliography of Fishes," "Zoological Record," "Biological Abstracts" and the "Current Bibliography for Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries" have all been searched for applicable citations. Further entries have been obtained from Gemmill&#039;s "Teratology of Fishes" and other references available to the writer. It is unfortunate that the included references have not all been read and abstracted but this was beyond the scope of available time and finances. In general, the bibliography is restricted to naturally occurring anomalies and literature on the experimental production of abnormalities has been omitted. The few exceptions, particularly in the areas of wounds and regeneration, are included because of their obvious application to survival studies on free-living fishes. All citations are given equal status in that no attempt has been made to indicate relative importance of individual contributions. It is doubtful whether any bibliography may be considered complete but it is felt that literature dealing directly with abnormalities has been fairly well covered. The major omissions may be expected in papers of Russian, Baltic and Scandinavian origin as well as in references to teratological material included in studies of a more general nature, and not listed in the titles. In this respect, it is requested that errors of ommission and commission be brought to the writer&#039;s attention. Authors of pertinent subject material are requested to forward reprints so that a continuing file on anomalous fishes may be maintained at this Laboratory. Abbreviations and complete titles of literature sources have largely been compiled from the "World List of Scientific Periodicals" and the "World List of Periodicals for Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries." The full title or place of publication have not been obtained for a few journals and these are identified only by the information available to the writer.

N2  - From June 1955 through May 1957, stations on three oyster reefs were sampled quantitatively at intervals and all oysters and associated macroscopic organisms were recorded per unit area. Station I was a privately leased “natural” reef, consisting of higher places exposed at low water, with a salinity range of 22.7-36.6 o/oo and was fairly productive. Station II, depth ca. two meters, was the least saline, range 1.2-29.3 o/oo, and was considered very productive for natural reef. Station III, depth one meter, salinity range 7.5-35.7 o/oo, was depleted although there was an abundant spatfall. Depth and bottom types as well as salinity were found to delimit certain species of animals. Analysis of past records showed that the bay had formerly been less saline; there was an extended drought in the watershed before and during the investigation. As a result several species of animals less euryhaline than oysters became established on some of the reefs. At Station III, two serious oyster enemies, Thais haemastoma Say and Menippe mercenaria Conrad were abundant. A field experiment at this station during the second year pointed to these two enemies as the main cause of the depletion of the reef. Near the end of the investigation rainfall became more nearly normal and the lowest salinities were recorded at this time. The reduction in salinity, especially at Station III, eliminated many of the less euryhaline species, including drills and stone crabs, and the reef later regained its former productivity.

N2  - The basic purpose of this work was to gain information on the possible role of some Rhode Island estuaries as nursery grounds for young migrant and resident species of fishes. The areas selected were, the lower Pettaquamscutt River and the lower Point Judith Pond, both in the town of Narragansett, Rhode Island. The seining operations were carried through summer and early fall of 1962 when these estuaries are heavily used as nursery grounds. Major features of the occurrence, abundance and distribution of young fishes were deduced by examining samples from seine hauls. Thirty-six species were recorded from the lower river while only twenty-four species occurred in the lower pond. The abundance of fishes rose with a rise in temperature and declined with decreasing temperature, but no correlation was observed between maximum temperature and maximum number of individuals occurring at any time. The number of species and the abundance of individual fish were highest at the seaward station (Sta. II) in the lower river. Among the selected species, the abundance of Menidia menidia was two to three times higher at Middle Bridge (Sta. II) than at any other station. The behavior of Pseudopleuronectes americanus, found primarily at seaward stations, and the migrant species Brevoortia tyrannus observed at landward stations, is discussed. The species P. americanus grew at the rate of 10 mm per month, but exhibited no variation in growth in the two estuarine systems. The populations of B. tyrannus from the lower Pettaquamscutt River had a growth rate that was almost twice that of populations in the lower Point Judith Pond. The growth rate of these species in Rhode lsland waters compare favorably with similar data from other studies. The juvenile M. menidia demonstrated a higher rate of growth at seaward stations in both the areas, especially in the lower river. Forty-three types of prey organisms belonging to diverse taxonomic groups were identified from stomach contents of P. americanus and thirty-nine types were noted in the gut contents of M. menidia. Amlysis of the degree of fullness indicated markedly high percentage of full stomachs in the two study areas. However the degree of fullness was comparatively less in fish occurring in the lower pond. The scarcity of food in the lower pond, apparently forced M. menidia (51-80 mm) to feed upon phytoplankton as a substitute food or “forced diet”. In P. americanus and M. menidia a change in diet was

N2  - Several workers and several lines of evidence have shown that the shrimp life cycle is very short, probably about 15 to 16 months, for the very small fraction reaching the largest adult size. Additionally, a great deal of commercial fishing is carried out upon sub-adult populations within the bays and shallow Gulf. In fact most shrimp that are caught have never spawned. These shrimp grow up within one warm season and they are derived from larvae which make their way to inside waters from the offshore spawning areas. Thus, it has been surmised for a long time that prediction of at least the relative abundance of the future shrimp could be deduced from studies of the numbers of young or juvenile shrimp in the bays right after they have completed their larval immigration. The first work on this problem was carried out by Baxter (1962) at the Galveston Laboratory of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries. He sampled one area at the entrance of Bolivar Pass, leading into Galveston Bay, with a beam trawl. Work at the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory in Mississippi Sound was carried out under contract with the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, and was initiated on 1 November 1962. The contract was terminated on 31 October 1964, although the work has been carried out on a reduced scale since that time. The present report covers the period of the contract.

The premise that all of the plants and animals living in a given area can never be located completely is naturally well-founded. However, it seems advisable to continue the search for unlisted species of Horn Island. Many unrecorded specimens have been collected and it seems proper at this time to make a supplementary list available to the public, particularly those interested in fields of science and nature. Knowing what is present on the island doubtless will tend to stimulate biological studies in various fields of endeavor.

N2  - During June, 1960, the M/V Hermes of the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory made several trawl hauls south of Horn Island, Mississippi. One haul was made June 27 at a depth of 20 m. on sandy mud botton at 30°04’30” N., 88”36’ W., or about 10 nautical miles south of Horn Island. A considerable number of animals, including starfish, hermit crabs and tube worms, were caught in the trawl. Pieces of the parchment-like worm tube of Chaetopterus variopedatus (Renier) were caught in the meshes of the net and were also collected. A small bivalve mollusk, Notocorbula operculata (Philippi 1848) was found to be attached to most of the Chaetopterus tubes. Microscopic examination showed that the bivalves were attached at the anterior ventral margin with a byssal thread. This little clam has been found under similar conditions at Dry Tortugas, Florida (Harvey R. Bullis, Jr., personal communication). It has been reported as abundant in 22-65 m. of water on mud bottom along the entire northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Parker 1960). It was also noticed that a single species of Foraminifera was attached to many of the clams. The attachment was not very strong, seeming to consist merely of a weak cement holding the ventral surface of the foraminifer to the bivalve shell, nor was it confined to a particular area on the bivalve, but occurred in any position on either valve.

N2  - The only seal native to the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean area is the West Indian seal (family Phocidae). It is tan on the upper surface and a yellowish white underneath. It is now extinct or nearly so. Two seals were reported in Louisiana near the mouth of the Mississippi in January 1966. Photographs of one animal taken from a helicopter showed an otariid seal. In late June a light colored otariid seal began to reside on the buoys of the ship channel leading into Mobile Bay. It stayed there about two and a half weeks. The animal was a light tan in color and was a female, with a large healing scar on the right side. It was formerly reported from buoys off Cedar Key, Florida, and a newspaper photo verified that account. The animal was similar in all respects to the California sea lion. It washed up on the beach of the Chandeleur Islands of Louisiana with a bullet hole in it and badly decomposed on 11 August 1966. On 3 April 1967 another sea lion, possibly the second Louisiana specimen, was photographed off Pensacola. Five verifiable records of the California sea lion in the Atlantic have been reported ranging from Louisiana to Newfoundland. Probably man was always involved in their transportation. The California sea lion can probably establish self-sustaining populations in the Atlantic Ocean.

N2  - A study of the effect of predation on infaunal invertebrates was carried out from July, 1965, to January, 1966, within the intertidal zone of Florida State University Marine Laboratory area at Alligator Harbor, located on the Northeast Gulf of Mexico. The animals were offered protection by wire-baskets of three different mesh sizes. Out of 1,112 infaunal invertebrates, 800 were recovered inside and 312 outside the baskets. The polychaetes, nemertines, phoronids, amphipods and bivalves made up the infauna; the polychaetes comprised the major part of it. Out of 34 species of polychaetes, six are reported from this area for the first time. The spawning period of two species of polychaetes and one gastropod was also observed, and the seasonal abundance of all polychaetes was noted. The depth preference of infaunal organisms was determined.

N2  - Citharichthys gilberti Jenkins and Evermann, a common eastern Pacific flatfish, is known from Guaymas and Baja California, Mexico, south to Peru (Miller, 1966). It attains a total length of at least 260 mm (Meek and Hildebrand, 1928), frequently occurs on muddy bottoms and may enter rivers or other brackish water environments. Despite wide distribution there are apparently few literature references to the species and little is known of its life history or development. During a recent trip to the Pacific coast of Panama, C. gilberti was found to be the most abundant flatfish taken at a number of poisoned inshore and intertidal stations. Sufficient specimens were obtained over a broad size range, 18-193 mm SL, to permit the present report on meristic and morphometric characteristics of the isthmian population.

N2  - One hundred ninety-one large scale menhaden, Brevoortia patronus, ranging in age from larvae to sexually mature females were used in this study. Collections were made in the littoral and shallow off shore waters of the Gulf of Mexico from Dauphin Island, Alabama, westward to West Bay, Louisiana, at intervals throughout a five year period. Using standard paraffin techniques a number of staining methods were employed. Cytological and histological accounts are presented of the tissue elements of the gonads beginning with inception in the larvae, sexual differentiation to the sexes, and the cyclic changes associated with oogenesis and spawning in the mature fish. The microscopic developments occurring during these periods are correlated with gross features of the organ, the ages of specimens, and with seasonal periods. An account of the morphology and physiology of atretic oocytes and ovulated follicles is presented. Using the ovarian components as an index, the time and duration of the spawning season is established as occurring from late October to February or early March with some variance due to environmental factors. From the study it is possible to postulate that this species exhibits intermittent total spawning in the Gulf.

N2  - A breeding population of Syngnathus scovelli was discovered in 1960 in Lake St. John near Ferriday, Louisiana, which is over 300 river miles from the Gulf of Mexico by the shortest possible route. Although S. scovelli has been known to be euryhaline, this constitutes the first record of a breeding population in fresh water. This study encompassed the period from July 1960 through February 1966. During this time S. scovelli were maintained for varying periods of time in fresh water aquaria. The longest period of time any one specimen lived in captivity was from 29 September 1960 until 16 November 1962, almost 27 months. The chief limiting factor to the maintenance of S. scovelli in fresh water aquaria appears to be a ready supply of live plankton for food. The breeding process of brackish water specimens was observed and is described. Gestation took 12 days in two males in August and both males bred the day after giving birth to a previous brood. Young S. scovelli measured 12 mm at birth. This is the first report of the length of newly born S. scovelli in the literature. A size range of 12-160 mm in length was noted for the species. A very rapid growth rate has been noted in the young from 12-80 mm, but growth slowed greatly at 80 mm. Three apparent year classes have been postulated among the specimens of S. scovelli collected in Lake St. John. These were: 0 (12-80 mm) , 1 (80-120 mm) , and 2 (120-160 mm) . Consecutive monthly data have not been consistent enough to prove this. Failure to collect these data may be due in great measure to the rotenone placed in Lake St. John by the Louisiana Wild Life and Fisheries Commission on 12 October 1961. The fresh water population from Lake St. John showed less variation in meristic characters than did the fish from Mississippi Sound.

N2  - An investigation to ascertain the species composition and the relative abundance of the fish population within the inland waters of Horn Island, Mississippi, a member of the offshore barrier island chain, was made from August 1965 to September 1966, and 69 species representing 58 genera and 35 families were encountered. In respect to the fishes certain biological and physical factors were noted. Forty-nine collecting stations were established on the island, and these were categorized according to the nature of their appearance and location. A salinity range from fresh to 29.9 ppt. was recorded for the sampled bodies of water, with the high salinity areas being under the influence of Mississippi Sound waters. Fishes with both marine and brackish water affinities were collected. Euryhaline species were taken from both fresh water and water which was approaching fresh; however, no true fresh water fishes were obtained. Members of the Atherinidae, Cyprinodontidae, and Poeciliidae (Menidia beryllina, Cyprinodon variegatus, Fundulus similis, Gambusia affinnis, and Poecilia latipinna) contributed most conspicuously to the fish population. Other families which were encountered formed somewhat less conspicuous elements in the population. The killifishes and poeciliids are capable of completing their life histories in the majority of examined areas, and these species contributed most obviously to the permanent occupancy of the inland waters due to their established resident breeding populations.

N2  - Seventy-five years ago the first report of the occurrence of Claviceps purpurea (Fr.) Tul. on Spartina alterniflora Loisel in Mississippi was made by Tracy and Earle (1895). Collections were taken at Ocean Springs, Mississippi on Christmas Day in 1892. These specimens are in the herbarium of the Department of Plant Pathology at Mississippi State University. Tracy and Earle presented no data on the infection rate nor does collection data indicate widespread infection. Parris (1959) published a revised host index of Mississippi plant diseases in which he listed C. purpurea based on the collections by &#039;Tracy and Earle. No further reports have been made of the parasite in this area of the Gulf Coast. The fungus, C purpurea, commonly known as ergot, was observed, collected and studied on S. alterniflora (smooth cord grass, oyster grass) in the tidal marshes of Mississippi during the late summer and fall of 1968. Collections taken by the author have been deposited at Mississippi State University, the United States Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service at Beltsville, Maryland, and the herbarium of the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory.

This report concerns all data for the project, which was carried out during 1967, 1968 and 1969. The only characteristic common to the following species is the rarity with which they are taken in regular shrimp trawling operations. Some are by no means rare in terms of total number available in the Gulf of Mexico, but it is worthwhile to report data collected as compared to others taken thirty-nine to forty-one years ago in nearby Louisiana. (Gunter, 19G5). Later Gunter (1941) listed certain rare fishes from Texas taken in both inside and outside waters. The data given here concern only offshore stations, which extended farther out than any previously reported from this coast.

This is the first report of lymphocystis in Fishes of the Gulf of Mexico and adds one family and two species to host records. Microscopic examination of the tumors revealed several histologic differences in the lesions of the two species. Mature tumor cells in the croakers were larger than those in the sand seatrout. In the croakers, these cells were closely packed and their hyaline capsules were usually confluent. In the sand seatrouts, the tumor cells were rarely confluent and were usually widely separated either bv interstitial connective tissue or by an amorphous, hyaline matrix that filled the intercellular. spaces. A preliminary description of the histology of the neoplasm was included. Ecological factors of the sampling stations where fishes infected with lymphocystis occurred were compared with stations where lymphocystis was not encountered. The pollution load was much greater in estuarine systems where lymphocystis was encountered. The chemical and physical differences observed at these stations were discussed.

N2  - The apparent habitat isolation of the mudshrimps Callianassa islagrande Schmitt and Callianassa jamaicense louisianensis Schmitt (Anomura : Thalassinidea) in Mississippi Sound is a function of species-related differences in ability to burrow and survive in the significantly different substrates of each habitat. C. islagrande is found only in sand bottomed beaches of the offshore barrier islands, whereas C. j. louisianensis is found only in the muddy backwaters of the mainland and Deer Island. Both forms produce deep and extensive permanent or semipermanent burrows in their respective habitat and are probably of some significance in sediment turnover. Laboratory studies show that C. j. louisianensis can only burrow efficiently in mud and cannot burrow or survive in sand unless there is sufficient available mud with which this form constructs its burrow walls. The inability of C. islagrande to tolerate silt limits its ability to burrow and survive in mud. For this reason C. islagrade cannot inhabit the muddy inshore waters. The poor burrowing efficiency of C. j. louisianensis in sand is due to a mechanical inability to handle uncohesive sand grains. The foliaceous third maxillipeds and comparatively larger second and third pereipods of C. islagrande (compared with those of C. j. louisianensis) are adaptations to a sandy habitat, enabling greater burrowing efficiency per unit of effort. Adults and juveniles exhibited the same behavior patterns in aquarium studies. Settling juveniles probably exhibit the same behavior pattern as adults and juveniles.

Laboratory experiments were carried out to determine possible effects of this upon the oyster Crassostrea virginica. It was found that drilling fluid reduced the survival of oysters to a significant degree in concentrations above 200 ppm. At turbidities between 200 and 500 ppm, there was 50% survival on the seventh day. Tanino in concentrations between 90 and 170 ppm had a drastic effect upon survival which was 50% between the fourth and fifth days. Bentonita in 110 to 190 ppm resulted in 50% survival on the eighth day. Barita in concentrations between 50 and 65 ppm did not produce noxious effects on the survival of the oysters. Natural mud in concentrations from 200 to 500 ppm was favorable for the survival of oysters.

N2  - The presence of disjunct species of animals on either side of the Florida peninsula has been reported by a number of authors. The littorinid mollusk, Littorina irrorata Say, which has a range from Massachusetts to the Rio Grande of Texas, except for south Florida, is one such species (Bequaert 1943). The marsh crab, Sesarma cinereum (Bosc), is another example of an animal with a distribution from Virginia to the western Gulf of Campeche except for a break in southern Florida (Rathbun, 1918). Williams (1965) lists 23 species of crustaceans having interrupted distribution at the Florida peninsula. This report on discovery of a breeding population of the Carolina marsh clam, Polymesoda caroliniana (Bosc) in southern Florida supports the contention by Hedgpeth (1953) that at least some, perhaps many, of the disjunct records may be a result of insufficient collecting in south Florida. The Carolina marsh clam has been assumed to be a typical disjunct species since it was described as such by van der Schalie (1933). It was not included in Marine Shells of Southwest Florida by Perry (1940) nor in Florida Marine Shells by Vilas and Vilas (1945). Abbott (1954) apparently knew of no southern Florida material, and recent examination of collections of this species in the E. S. National Museum provided no material south of New Smyrna on the east coast or Fort Myers on the west coast of Florida. Gunter and Hall (1963) found a breeding colony in the St. Lucie River estuary near Fort Pierce, Florida extending the range nearly 275 km farther south along the Florida east coast but gave no details on the size of the population. The initial discovery of a single valve of the Carolina marsh clam in extreme southern Florida was made by Tabb and Manning (1961) in deltaic muds at the mouth of the East River where it enters Whitewater Bay in Everglades National Park. Since 1962 sufficient discoveries have been made in Everglades National Park to prove the existence of a breeding population occupying two rather different but adjoining habitats over an extensive area of southern coastal marsh.

N2  - There have been very few articles concerning the effects of hurricanes upon marine and shore organisms. Some effects on fishes have been described by Hubbs (1962) and in that paper he reviewed some of the previous references. Information on animals killed or injured by hurricanes is scarce because potential observers in areas where they strike are generally more concerned with practical personal matters than biological studies right after a bad storm. The senior author has been in or very close to seven West India hurricanes as they came ashore. Each time he was somewhat forewarned and had determined to make some type of quantitative appraisal of killed animals following these storms. However, on no occasion has this been done. Nevertheless, the two writers have collected some fragmentary information worth recording.

N2  - The objectives of the present investigation are: (a) to delineate spawning seasons and the areas of as many species as possible based on larval abundance; (b) to study the spatial and seasonal distribution of penaeid larvae in relation to depth, temperature, salinity and seasons, which will indicate the movements of the spawners; (e) to inquire whether any correlation exists between occurrence of larvae and of adults in any area; (d) to examine the relationship between Penaeus postlarval abundance in the Mississippi Sound and larval and postlarval occurrence in the open sea; and (e) to study the vertical seasonal distribution of different stages, and to find out whether different developmental stages exhibit diurnal migrations. Larvae of six genera, Penaeus, Parapenaeus, Trachypeneus, Xiphopeneus, Sicyonia, and Solenocera, were encountered and the information on these is presented here. Protozoeal and mysis stages of Gennadas and Artemisia were collected, and these are new records from the Gulf of Mexico. They were reported by Subrahmanyam and Gunter (1970). The study was conducted from November 1966 to December 1968 inclusive.

N2  - A seasonal study of the nektonic and benthic faunas of the shallow Gulf of Mexico off Mississippi was conducted from January 1967 through May 1969. It was planned to sample monthly six fixed offshore stations at depths ranging from 5 to 50 fathoms in the open Gulf. In general this was carried out fairly well. Water samples were taken from surface, midwater, and bottom levels each time a station was occupied, and temperatures and salinities were recorded for each of these. Samples were tested for the presence of nitrates, nitrites, ortho-phosphates and total phosphates. Secchi disc extinction points were recorded. Grab samples were taken for the determination of bottom composition. Plankton samples were taken from surface, midwater and bottom levels. Copepods, brachyuran zoea and megalops, stomatopod larvae, Lucifer faxoni, Acetes a. carolinae, Penilia avirostris, Doliolum sp. and fish eggs and larvae were present in greatest abundance. Surface and benthic nekton samples were obtained. Dredge samples were made quarterly and twelve invertebrate species and three species of fishes were collected. Renilla mülleri was the most abundant species taken, and the fish catch consisted of Centropristes ocyurus, Citharichthys spilopterus and Etropus crossotus. Accounts of 50 invertebrate species (24,679 specimens) and 129 fishes (93,563 specimens) taken in trawl hauls is presented. Temperature and salinity data are given for all species. Relative abundance, seasonal bathymetric distributions and movements, apparent growth patterns, catch per unit of effort and various biological data are noted for the most abundant species. Station 5 (40 fathoms) produced the largest percentage of trawl catches (22.7). Renilla mülleri was the most abundant invertebrate taken in trawling. The brown shrimp, Penaeus aztecus, was second in abundance (10.92%). The five most abundant species comprising 80.57% numerically of the catch were croaker, longspine porgy, butterfish, spot, and seatrout. The species comprising 91.89% of the catch by weight were the croaker, longspine porgy, spot, seatrout, lizardfish, butterfish, pinfish, bank sea bass, sea catfish and black fin sea robin. The families Sciaenidae, Sparidae and Stromateidae were represented by the greatest numbers and comprised 82.9% of the total catch. Families considered to be of commercial importance contributed 92.9% to the total fish catch.

N2  - On 8 July 1965 one damaged specimen of the remarkable scyphozoan, Deepstaria enigmatica Russell 1967, was taken in the course of a sampling program conducted by the Department of Oceanography, Texas A&M University in a ten-foot Issacs-Kidd midwater trawl in the Yucatan Basin. The trawl was put into water at Lat. 19" 58&#039; N, Long. 85" 14&#039; W. This is the first report of Deepstaria in the Atlantic region. This medusa is otherwise known only from the Pacific Ocean where it has been captured by slurp gun from the submersible Deepstar over the San Diego Trench and has been taken in midwater trawls by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Mid-Pacific Expedition (Barham and Pickwell 1969 and Russell 1967). The present specimen, although badly torn, is clearly recognizable as D. enigmatica. The anastomosing canal lattice has the characteristic pattern described by Russell. The medusa is a deep purpleblue in color and appears to have had a diameter in excess of 70 cm. The mesogloea is 18 mm. thick near the center of the disc. Oral arms are not discernible and portions of the disc are considerably distorted by local extreme contraction. Fragments of female gonadal material are attached to parts of the subumbrellar surface. These gonadal fragments, too small to permit any observations on gross gonad morphology, contain zygotes in various stages of early cleavage. Ova and zygotes are small (c. 100 microns diameter) and have very little, if any, yolk. The depth at which this jellyfish was taken cannot be stated with any certainty since the collecting device fished from the surface to a depth of 2400 m., no "at depth" closing device having been used.

N2  - Stranding records are sometimes the only source of data concerning some species of cetaceans and it is appropriate that these incidents be reported in some detail. This is particularly true of rare or little known species. Bottle-nosed dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) carcasses stranded on the Mississippi and Louisiana coasts are so common that they receive little attention. Other species occur and have, no doubt, been overlooked or confused by laymen with Tursiops. Even the rare stranding of large whales in this area may go unreported except for news stories that fail to identify the animal properly and which are not readily available to cetologists. The stranding in 1967 of one of the first definitely reported finbacks, Balaenoptera physalus, in the Gulf of Mexico is given here. It is the first Mississippi record. Moore (1953) noted that “only six specimens of the goose-beaked whale have been reported on the eastern coast of North America” and provided four new records from the Florida west coast. The present report includes a Louisiana stranding in 1969.

These included Saprodinium, Euplotes, Paraeuplotes, Vorticella, Cohnilembus, Anophrys, Uronema and Vahlkampfia. Approximately forty anemones were collected from jetty rocks on Galveston Island on 3 November 1970. Note was made within one day of protozoans found on the external surfaces, in the coelenteron and in surrounding sea water. The anemones were kept until 7 December 1970 under varying conditions and bi-weekly note was made of the associated protozoan fauna.

N2  - There is a strong correlation between the total catch of white and brown shrimp with dockside prices on the United States Gulf Coast since 1902, but there is no significant correlation between South Atlantic production and prices, probably because the South Atlantic shrimp stocks have been over-fished since the 1920s. There is no negative or positive correlation between the catch statistics of brown and white shrimp of the United States, and these species seem to be weakly competitive, if at all. There is a significant correlation between the annual production of South Atlantic and Gulf white shrimp, but there is none between South Atlantic and Gulf brown shrimp, possibly because the brown shrimp live generally in deeper water and are not so much influenced by short term variations in climatic conditions as the white shrimp are in shallow water. In furtherance of this idea, there is some indication that the brown shrimp production is less variable than the white shrimp production.

N2  - Holothurin, a biotoxic principle from the Cuvierian glands of the Bahamian sea-cucumber, Actinopyga agassizi, was studied as an anti-tumor agent capable of retarding tumor growth and prolonging the life of tumor-bearing mice. White Swiss mice injected with Sarcoma 180 had a mean survival time of 18.1 days with an average weight gain representing tumor and ascites fluid accumulation amounting to 25.1 grams in 15 days. Of five white Swiss mice with Sarcoma 180 receiving 0.15 mg Holothurin every other day, one was alive at 57 days and the average weight gain of the group was 10.4 grams in 15 days. White Swiss mice with Sarcoma 180 which survived the lethal effects of slightly higher doses of Holothurin also had prolonged survival times and negligible tumor growth. C57-Bl-6J mice with B-16 melanoma tumors did not show increased survival time using the same doses of Holothurin that were effective in white Swiss mice. Toxicity tests indicated that the safe upper limit for intraperitoneal Holothurin injection in white Swiss mice was 0.10 mg/day, 0.15 mg given every other day, and up to 0.30 mg given in a single injection. Similar tests with C57 black mice showed survival with as much as 0.60 mg Holothurin in a single subcutaneous injection. Holothurin was found to be 250 to 500 times more effective in causing red blood cell hemolysis than saponin and thus appears to have some action on living cells in addition to its surfactant action.

N2  - The goal of this study was twofold: 1) chemically to characterize a specific salt marsh, the sediments and associated biota and 2) to establish clear relationships between the chemical substances residing in the sediments and similar or identical substances occurring in the biological specimens. In this particular study it was felt that the hydrocarbons would yield the most significant organic geochemical information. These compounds are ubiquitous but minor components of all organisms. Though their function is not entirely understood, it is known that they are concentrated in the waxy coatings of plants and most likely aid in the protective mechanisms of plants. Among the several classes of biochemical materials, the hydrocarbons exhibit probably the greatest resistance to biological and chemical degradation and therefore may be preferentially concentrated and preserved in sedimentary environments. An extreme variety of specific hydrocarbons occurs naturally in plants and hence the possible combinations and distributions of these hydrocarbons are limitless. The stability and unique distributions of hydrocarbons ranks them as a very important tool in the correlation of biolipids and geolipids.

N2  - The most useful aquatic areas in the world are in serious danger of destruction. The estuaries, where fresh water, land and sea meet in a dynamic and highly productive zone, are today gravely threatened through unwise and unplanned excessive use of their valuable but finite capacities. Estuaries include the coastal zone which is affected by both the run-off of fresh water from the land and the salt water from the sea. This zone includes tidal rivers, marshes, bays and river mouths. The value of these estuarine regions has been well established by biologists. However, this value is fully appreciated by only a handful of people. The intense uses to which the coastal zone is being placed are so expansive, so competitive and potentially so destructive. Much shipping for industrial and military purposes begins and ends in estuaries. The waste products of the industries which crowd the coastal zone and of one-third of the population of this country are daily being poured into these waters. Estuaries are directly linked to suitable conditions needed for the development of three-fourths of the fish and shellfish taken for food production and recreational fishing. In addition, the use of these so important coastal regions is ever increasing by our growing population for aesthetic and recreational purposes. Each of the above uses is an important human use. However, each of these uses is potentially destructive. Even aesthetic uses, which have heretofore been above reproach, can irretrievably destroy this fragile ecosystem when vast areas are developed for housing projects by dredging and filling in the land. In fact, this action may destroy the very reason why people wish to move to the shore. All of these uses, and others, have developed without sufficient comprehension of their effects and interactions and totally without planning for an optimal balance for present and future human uses. Present and potential human uses involve vast and complicated economic problems, political and geographic difficulties, and grave social and legal complications. It is with the latter, the legal problems of wetlands preservation and utilization, that this paper is concerned.

N2  - The Chaetognatha as “biological indicators’’ have attracted attention from various fields of oceanography and fisheries biology because various species of Chaetognatha are associated with different water masses, and their distribution and numerical abundance are used to infer biological productivity and movements of water with their inherent temperature, salinity, sediment load pH, and other variables (Legark and Zoppi 1961, Redfield 1950). The Chaetognatha populations, therefore, tend to fluctuate following the seasonal changes and the influx of water masses from different sources. The present work is a study of seasonal changes in the numerical abundance of the Chaetognatha species during a yearly cycle in Mississippi Sound. A comparison is made with the seasonal abundance of calanoid copepods, an important zooplankton component, for a possible correlation.

N2  - Estuarine grass shrimp (Palaemonetes) are common along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts (Faxon 1879, Gunter 1950, Williams 1965, Fleming 1967). These small decapods are found ranging through freshwater areas, brackish estuaries and into inshore saline waters where they are occasionally the predominant animal (Gunter 1950). In view of the trophic significance of these shrimp, static system bioassays were made to determine the sensitivity of Palaemonetes pugio to Mirex in water and to 0.15% Mirex bait granules, since the USDA is continuing the fire ant control program but has plans in the future to substitute 0.15% Mirex bait for the 0.3% bait presently in use (J.

N2  - The present study was undertaken with the purpose of getting the proper basis for exploiting brown shrimp resources in a rational manner, by introducing control regulations of fishing activities. The growth rate models are necessary for the other parameters of population dynamics of the stocks of this species, whose annual catch, Osborn, Maghan and Drummond (1969), averages 54 million pounds of tail weight, representing 52% of the total shrimp caught in the Gulf of Mexico. This shows that Penaeus aztecus aztecus is the most important of shrimp species exploited in this region. Nevertheless, the brown shrimp is the least well known of the three most common species. The growth rate was determined by fitting the von Bertalanffy growth curve to offshore populations, on which according to Cook and Lindner (1970), there are no published data, although an unsuccessful attempt was made by Klima (1964). Published data are only from inshore waters (Williams 1955, Loesch 1965, Joyce and St. Amant et al., from Cook and Lindner 1970). Statistical calculations of length-weight and total length-tail length ratios were required before available raw data could be used in growth analyses. Tesch (1968), points out that age data, along with length and weight measurements represent the basis for information on growth, composition of stocks, maturity age, life span, mortality and production.

Plankton were separated into net plankton and nannoplankton fractions. Nannoplankton3 standing biomass exceeded by 72 times that of net plankton. Although protein and carbohydrate levels were higher in net plankton on a unit weight basis, total nutrients available from nannoplankton were substantially higher. Some seasonal trends were apparent as changes in the standing biomass in net plankton. Nannoplankton exhibited no seasonal trends. Lipid and caloric values of net plankton showed seasonal trends similar to those shown by dry weight.

Fish identified as Mugil curema, M. cephalus, Megalops atlantica, Dormitator maculatus, and Fundulus grandis were found dead in other low saline estuarine areas. Fish-kills during cold periods are less commonly encountered in Mississippi than in Texas or Florida. This particular incident is attributed to conditions of stress for fishes incompletely acclimated to the encountered low temperatures. The most deleterious stress was the low saline water which probably allowed a breakdown in the fishes’ ion-osmoregulatory mechanisms. Striped mullet and other euryhaline fishes in salinities greater than 6 ppt survived, as did freshwater centrarchids and ictalurids in areas with dying mullet. Other stresses thought to contribute to the weakening of striped mullet in Paige Bayou during the period of rapidly decreasing temperatures include starvation and high levels of pesticide residues. In examined fish, the alimentary tracts were devoid of food, the gall bladders were distended and leaking bile, the livers contained excess lipid material and were often stained throughout with bile pigments, and the levels of DDT metabolites and endrin residues in the liver were higher than in control fish. Stress caused by low levels of dissolved oxygen, toxic substances in the water, or disease was discounted as a cause of death.

N2  - The annual net primary production of nine types of marsh communities common in Mis­sissippi Gulf Coast estuaries were studied by means of the Harvest Method. Production values ranged from 600 g m-2 yr-1 for a Sagittaria lancifolia marsh to 2330 g m-2 yr-1 for a Phragmites communis marsh. Primary productivity values for the other marsh types are Juncus roemerianus - 1697 g m-2 yr-1, Scirpus robustus - 1056 g m-2 yr-1, Spartina cynosuroides - 2190 g m-2 yr-1, Spartina patens - 1922 g m-2 yr-1, Spartina altemijlora tall form - 1964 g m-2 yr-1, S. alternijlora short form - 1089 g m-2 yr-1, and Distichlis spicata - 1484 g m-2 yr-1. Annual net productivity in Mississippi marshes are generally slightly higher than those reported for the Atlantic marshes.

N2  - The nongaseous substances that normally move in and out of cells are metabolites, water and salts. The common salts in water determine its salinity, and the definition of sea water salinity and its composition are discussed. The relationships of salinity to all phyla of animals living in the coastal waters are reviewed, with emphasis on the estuaries of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the United States, which are particularly influenced by coastal engineering works and changes of salinity caused thereby. The fauna of estuaries is made up of a few brackish water species which complete their life cycles there, marine species which spend only a part of their life cycles there and which have definite low-salinity limits, a few anadromous species passing through, and a few fresh water species with high salinity limits. Organisms of marine origin are dominant. Floods and drought periods, resulting in severe osmotic changes, may kill organisms or result in drastic changes of the biota, which may take extended time to reestablish itself, if the conditions return to normal. Many invertebrate animals have few mechanisms for controlling the movement of waters and salts across their external membranes and thus are osmotic conformers. Species that cannot withstand wide salinity change are said to be stenohaline, but many species can tolerate rather wide changes; they have broad tolerance at a cellular level. Osmoregulators exhibit considerable control of their internal salinity by excretory mechanisms and permeability control of the body surface to water and salts. In general, the worms and molluscs are more often osmoconformers than the crustaceans, the latter having greater control over their internal osmotic environment than other invertebrate groups. Effects upon different stages of life history are different, but in general the limiting effects of salinity and other environmental factors bear upon the reproductive stages or the young. The limits of salinities are nearly always on the lower side with regard to estuarine organisms. Aside from osmotic adjustments, animals react to salinity changes by closing their shells, closing their burrows, burying in the bottom where interstitial water has higher salinity, or motile forms simply move out. In spite of these adjustments, none may be successful during large floods. The salinity relationships of all phyla are reviewed, even though some of them are unimportant parts of the marine populations. Dinoflagellate Protozoa which cause red tides have precise salinity requirements and their outbreaks would be subject to

N2  - A rubber band permanently girdled an Atlantic croaker, Micropogon undulatus, resulting in considerable malformation and pathological alterations of the fish. On 12 July 1973 at Graveline Bayou, Jackson County, Mississippi, Mrs. Buster Blades caught on hook and line a 175 mm standard length (102.1 g) croaker that she immediately separated from the rest of her catch as a suspected parasitized fish. Later upon closer examination, she realized that a rubber band encircled the fish, and so she brought the fish to us. The band had deformed the prepelvic isthmus, restricted movement of the pectoral fins, and permanently encircled the fish through a hole in the dorsum. Much of the elasticity was lost, but the band was entire and free to rotate through the perforation below the first dorsal fin. The tissue above the perforation, including the tissue of the dorsal fin, was complete and not severed, although several scales were regenerated. These observations, in addition to the malformed ventral area, suggest a lengthy association between band and fish.

N2  - I. Gunter and Christmas (1973) described the events leading to the stranding of a baleen whale on Ship Island, Mississippi, in 1968, giving the species as Balaenoptera physalus, the Rorqual. Unfortunately the identification was in error, but fortunately good photographs were shown. The underside of the tail was a splotched white, but there was no black margin. The specimen also had fewer throat and belly grooves than the Rorqual, as a comparison with True’s (1904) photograph shows. Dr. James Mead (in litt.) pointed out that the animal was a Sei Whale, Balaenoptera borealis. This remains a new Mississippi record and according to Lowery’s (1974) count, it is the fifth specimen reported from the Gulf of Mexico. The stranding of a sixth Sei Whale on Anclote Keys in the Gulf, west of Tarpon Springs, Florida on 30 May 1974, was reported in the newspapers and by the Smithsonian Institution (1974). II. Gunter, Hubbs and Beal (1955) gave measurements on a Pygmy Sperm Whale, Kogia breviceps, which stranded on Mustang Island on the Texas coast and commented upon the recorded variations of proportional measurements in this species. Then according to Raun, Hoese and Moseley (1970) these questions were resolved by Handley (1966), who showed that a second species, Kogia simus, the Dwarf Sperm Whale, is also present in the western North Atlantic. Handley’s argument is based on skull comparisons and it seems to be rather indubitable. According to Raun et al. (op. cit.), the stranding of a species of Kogia on Galveston Island recorded by Caldwell, Ingles and Siebenaler (1960) was K. simus. They also say that Caldwell (in litt.) had previously come to the same conclusion. Caldwell et al. also recorded another specimen from Destin, Florida, which is now considered to have been a specimen of simus. The known status of these two little sperm whales in the Gulf is summarized by Lowery (op. cit.).

N2  - During May 20-31, 1968, 14,301 brown shrimp (Penaeus aztecus) were marked and released in Biloxi Bay, Mississippi. Of these 7,023 were marked by injection with a combination of Niagara Sky Blue 6B stain and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) internal tags and 7,278 were marked with Petersen tags. The objectives of this experiment were to compare the two methods as marks for shrimp and to obtain information on growth rates and migrations. Eighteen weeks after release, 1,942 (28%) of those marked with the biological stain-internal tag combination and 2,286 (31%) of those marked with Petersen tags had been recovered. The difference in proportions recaptured (significant at P <0.01) could have resulted from greater ease in recognition of the Petersen tag by commercial fishermen or from differential marking mortality, although no evidence was found that differential marking mortality occurred. Marking mortality was observed for both marks and appeared inversely related to size at time of marking. No significant differences were found between growth rates of shrimp marked with the biological stain-internal tag combination and those of shrimp marked with the Petersen tag, although most weekly average increments for stained shrimp were higher. Rates of return were similar in the vicinity of the release area, although a significantly higher proportion (P <0.01) of returns from waters outside of Biloxi Bay were marked with Petersen tags. Again, this was attributed primarily to greater ease in recognition by commercial fishermen. It was concluded that the Petersen tag was the more effective of the two marks as it appeared to be recognized more readily over longer periods of time than the biological stain.

N2  - Investigations were made in Mississippi Sound and adjacent waters from March 1968 through March 197 1 to record the occurrence and seasonality of planktonic cnidarians. About 700 plankton samples were taken from estuarine and oceanic areas. From these samples, 26 species of hydromedusae were identified, 12 of which were collected from Mississippi Sound. In addition, 25 species of siphonophorae were identified from Mississippi waters, although only 6 species were collected in Mississippi Sound. From an examination of about 500 trawl samples taken during this period, 10 species of Scyphozoa were found in Mississippi waters, 6 of which occurred in Mississippi Sound.

N2  - Analysis of 670 trawl, seine and marsh net samples collected from July 1971 through June 1973 provided data on the distribution and abundance of blue crabs in Mississippi Sound. Highest average catches were associated with salinities between 5.0 and 15.0 ppt (parts per thousand) and temperatures between 20.0 and 25.0oC. Young crabs congregated in dredged navigational channels and in the marshes that fringe the bays and coastline. Maximum numbers were captured over soft mud bottoms. Peak numbers of zoeae occurred in the summer and fall. Megalopae were collected in all months. Early crab stages appeared throughout the year. Width-frequency distributions suggested rapid growth. Crabs tagged and released in Lake Borgne, La. during the fall of 1971 moved into Mississippi Sound in the vicinity of Cat Island to overwinter. Recoveries of crabs released in the St. Louis Bay, Biloxi Bay and Pascagoula River estuarine systems indicated little movement between estuaries during the spring and summer. Identified parasites included a new microphallid trematode. Commercial landings of blue crabs averaged 1,712,000 pounds for the 20-year period 1953-1972. Catch per unit of effort (pounds/pot day) was low during the spring and fall, peaking in the summer. Rises in the catch per unit of effort closely followed the migration of female crabs into Mississippi Sound.

N2  - The extensive rhizome development found in Juncus roemerianus makes this species unique among rushes and is a biological feature responsible, in part, for its domination of large tracts of salt marsh. Branching in certain mature plants is distinctly sympodial, while in most it is obscured by precocious development of the continuation bud and appears to be monopodial. Each vegetative unit is composed of a scaly rhizome which grows to varying lengths and then abruptly turns up at the end to become an erect shoot. A continuation rhizome consistently arises from an axillary bud in a ventral scale leaf. Transitional leaves (large scale leaves) accompany development of the erect shoot. Rhizome scales, transitional and foliage leaves are distichously arranged and in the same vertical plane. The culm forms through an elongation of an internode of an erect shoot. Other rhizomes may also arise from buds in the axils of the transitional and foliage leaves. From one to seven terete leaves with a bifacial sheath are produced from the apical meristem of the erect stem. Fibrous roots occur laterally on erect shoots. Non-fibrous roots occur on the ventral surface to the rhizomes. The internal rhizome and root anatomy resembles that reported for most other species of Juncus while the leaf anatomy is very similar to that of Juncus maritimus and Juncus acutus.

N2  - Brown shrimp and white shrimp populations available to the shrimp trawl in Mobile Bay were estimated on a monthly basis by two methods: one using existing commercial statistics and the other using experimental trawling. These methods produced similar estimates for brown shrimp whose peak standing crop in Mobile Bay occurred in June-July and was estimated at 200,000-300,000 pounds. Commercial landings peaked in July at about 342,000 pounds and were higher than the standing crop, indicating an extremely fast growth rate. White shrimp data were variable, with commercial statistics indicating a crop in Mobile Bay of about 100,000 pounds from September to November and with experimental trawl data indicating a peak of 267,000 pounds in August. Average monthly harvests approached 100,000 pounds from August to October. Abundance of pink shrimp was erratic and commercial shrimp statistics indicate variation from 475 pounds landed in 1956 to 34,000 pounds landed in 1957.

Catches in Mobile Bay of approximately 20,000 each of P. aztecus and Penaeus setiferus, distributed over a 30-month period, show that P. aztecus taken in the hotter months had a wider salinity preference (5 to 30‰) than those taken in the cooler months (10 to 15‰). During the warmer months P. setiferus was most common in waters below 5‰ and during the winter months was almost equally distributed in the various salinities. Few P. duorarum were taken during the survey.

N2  - Commercial brown shrimp (Penaeus aztecus) were shown to consume large numbers of mysid shrimp (Mysidopsis almyra) under laboratory conditions. Growth of shrimp fed a diet of mysids was comparable to growth of shrimp fed a diet of Artemia nauplii. It is suggested that mysid shrimp may serve as a food source for juvenile penaeid shrimp in northwestern Gulf coast estuaries.

N2  - Ten distinct species of larval cestodes were obtained from 43 edible, or potentially edible, benthic mollusks of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Three of the infected mollusks, American oysters, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin), Atlantic bay scallops, Argopecten irradians concentricus (Say), and sunray venus clams, Macrocallista nimbosa (Lightfoot), are important commercial species in the eastern Gulf and the remainder are occasionally eaten by epicurean shellfishermen or were consumed by prehistoric, aboriginal Indians of the Gulf coast. The cestodes represent four orders, seven families and nine recogized genera and include the trypanorhynchs, Euteirarhynchus sp. (of Cake 1975) and Parachristianella sp. (of Cake 1975), the Iecanicephalideans, Polypocephalus sp. (of Cake 1975) and Tylocephalum sp. (of Burton 1963), the tetraphyllideans, Dioecotaenia cancellata (Linton 1890), Anthobothrium sp. (of Cake 1975), Rhinebothrium sp. (of Cake 1975), Acanthobothrium sp. (of Regan 1963), and Acanthobothrium sp. (of Harry 1969), and the diphyllidean, Echinobothrium sp. (of Cake 1975). Infected mollusks were widely distributed in coastal estuarine and marine habitats from the Mississippi Sound to the Florida Keys. Pelecypods appear to serve as primary intermediate hosts and molluscivorous gastropods appear to serve as secondary intermediate or paratenic (transport) hosts for these cestodes which in turn utilize demersal elasmobranch fish as final hosts. None of these cestodes are known to infect humans and the only potential harm is to the quality and quantity of the edible molluscan tissues.

N2  - The effect of depth on oysters in suspension culture from a petroleum platform off the Texas coast was monitored for 20 months. Growth and condition was similar for adult oysters cultured at five levels down to 8 m. Oysters had a growth rate of 1.2 mm (level 3) to 1.4 mm (level 1) per month,representing an increase in length of 94% to 150% for the 20 months. The condition was best in June 1973 after five months placement offshore (condition index of 14.8, 15.5, 14.7, 13.5 and 13.2 for levels 1 through 5, respectively). The condition was lowest in June 1974 (2.2, 2.1, 1.3, 1.4 and 1 .5 for levels 1 through 5, respectively). Ninety oysters died during the experimental period. Sixty-three percent were trom the upper two levels. One hundred forty-five oysters disappeared. Fifty-eight percent were from the bottom two levels. Most oysters disappeared in February 1974 (47% of all disappearances).

N2  - The fine structure of normal heart muscle from the silver perch, Bairdiella chrysura (Lacépède), is similar to that previously reported for marine and freshwater teleosts. Cardiac lymphocystis is a viral disease manifested by single, giant-cell lesions variously located in the epicardium, trabecular spaces, and subendocardium – in direct apposition to myocardial cells. Occasionally, the hyaline capsule of lymphocystis cells partially surround myocardial cells but cause no pathological changes or inflammatory reaction. The lymphocystis cells contain typical cellular organelles, including the viroplasmic net unique to these cells. Annulate lamellae, often continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum, are present, usually along the periphery of the cell. Some elements of the rough endoplasmic reticulum are dilated and contain a finely granular material, but others contain cross-banded fibrils, each having a periodicity of 30 nm. Similar fibrils are present in the perinuclear cisternae.

N2  - The eye lens weight to age relationship was examined in croaker, Micropogon undulatus. Lenses were removed, fixed, and weighed using standard techniques. Age estimates were assigned based on total length measurements. Lens weight showed good correlation with total length. Age could be estimated by eye lens weight, but no more accurately or precisely than with length frequency analysis. Cumulative percent frequency analysis of lens weights showed distinct inflections in the curve, which correspond to hypothesized length at age points. The data seem to verify age structure based on length frequency analysis.

N2  - Reasons are given for believing that charging alligators are serious, especially at their nests and in group defense of the young, rather than going through a “ritualized bluff.” Observations are presented describing the actions of competing alligators and the establishment of territories between them in Mississippi brackish waters. Recent history has shown that alligators can live in natural streams and habitats close to human habitation, if they are not molested. The writer suggests that they should be removed from such environments when they attain a length of nine t o ten feet because at that size they become dangerous. If man exterminates himself the various crocodilian species may survive for another quarter of a billion years as their ancestors have in the past.

N2  - The Northern Gannet nests on rock cliffs in the north Atlantic and winters as far south as Yucatan on the west, and N.W. Africa on the east. The birds are not known to cross land and seem to fly around Florida to enter the Gulf of Mexico. Most numbers have been reported off Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida panhandle. Numbers in the western Gulf seem to be few. There are 12 skeletal parts or skins of Texas gannets in museums in Texas and Louisiana. Two specimens have been collected in Louisiana, only one of which is known to remain. There are 6 specimens from the Mississippi coast (one from the high seas) in Mississippi and Louisiana museums, none from Alabama and 10 from south Florida. Gannets have been reported previously from the Gulf in every month but August. A live specimen was taken in Mississippi Sound on August 10, 1977 following heavy squalls. It was immature. It died on the same day. The skin was deposited in The Fannye A. Cook Memorial, the Mississippi Museum of Natural History, cataloged as Ab 5019.

N2  - The estimation of the net primary productivity of marsh communities with a periodic maximum-minimum (PMM) technique has certain advantages over the long used maximum-minimum standing stock technique, but still retains the same conceptual simplicity. The final productivity estimate with PMM is based an the entire data set rather than just two points. Direct statistical comparisons between any two communities can be made. An estimate of the productivity by minor species in the community can also be made. The periodic model permits statistical comparisons about other variables in community growth such as the timing of the maximurn standing crop. With certain assumptions, productivity estimates which account for the loss of live plant material during the growing season can be made without the tremendous amount of effort and-time required by the Wiegert-Evans technique. Despite the increased utility the PMM technique requires no additional field effort.

N2  - Examined digestive tracts of the red drum in Mississippi Sound contained mostly decapod crustaceans. Crustaceans accounted for 34 of 59 encountered taxa, more than reported from any other region. Nevertheless, the general diet for 104 fish with food contents out of the 107 examined is similar to that reported for red drum in several other studies from other areas. In addition to crustaceans, fishes followed by polychaetes occurred as the most important items (in 99, 43, and 15% of the drum with food, respectively). Blue crabs occurred in even more drum than the frequently encountered penaeid shrimps. Other commercial species were negligible in the diet. Sixteen large drum from Georgia beaches were also examined; unlike those from Mississippi, many of these contained echinoderms, but not polychaetes or penaeids. We suggest that the red drum’s migrations may be regulated by optimal abundance of specific types of dietary organisms.

N2  - Silica content of living rhizomes from the perennial salt marsh rush Juncus roemerianushad values of 0.34, 0.20, and 0.60% of dry weight in three morphologically distinct populations along the Mississippi coast and was directly related to available silica content of the soil (29.7, 17.0, 169.6 mg/100g soil, respectively). On the other hand, living leaves had about the same average silica content (0.93, 0.87, 0.9070 or dry weight). The silica content of living leaves varied from 0.142% in younger leaves to 1.520% in older ones. Similarly, rhizomes also increased in silica content with age, varying from 0.137% in younger portions to 1.030% for older ones. Mature leaves collected in October all had a higher average silica content (0.737%) than those collected in April (0.413%), indicating that silica content also increases over the growing season. Decomposed leaves (dead-standing) had a relatively high silica content o f 1.8170, obviously reflecting a loss of organic matter and soluble minerals. Roots contain considerable silica, but reliable results were not possible as the soil could not be completely removed from them. Petrographic microscope studies showed that the silica was clear, colorless and isotropic with a refractive index of 1.43, all properties typical of the mineral opal. No α-quartz was present, as occurs in some species of Juncus. The silica was deposited in a sheet made up of small, irregular phytoliths arranged in rows lengthwise in the leaves. Ash percentages were much higher than those for silica and no definite conclusions could be drawn from their variation. In comparison to the maximum silica content of leaves from Juncus interior (3.21%), the concentrations found in leaves of J. roemerianus were relatively low.

N2  - An unidentified species of hydrozoan in the family Eirenidae was inadvertently transported to the Laboratory with a stock of Mysidopsis bahia. The hydrozoan competed for food, ate the young mysids, and subsequently reproduced extensively. Hermit crabs provided minimal control. A detailed transfer procedure for the mysids eliminated the hydrozoans from cultures; hydrozoans were eradicated from tanks after removal of mysids by using 1:1200 formalin, hot water, and Clorox.

N2  - Mississippi Sound is classified as to estuary hydrological type by the method of Pritchard (1955). Differences in salinity between surface and near-bottom water were calculated from 2,401 pairs of observations made at 90 stations from 4 April 1973 to 12 April 1977. Frequency distribution tables, constructed by tallying the vertical salinity differences into three classes corresponding to three of Pritchard&#039;s estuary types (A, stratified; B, partially mixed; D, well mixed) were used to assess salinity structure of the water column. The greatest variation as to type occurred from January through June. From July through December, the water column becomes predominately uniform. Mississippi Sound is shown to be primarily well mixed with approximately one-third of the observations indicating partially mixed and less than 2% being stratified. The channels are characteristically stratified or partially mixed. The results of this study were in good agreement with the previous classification by another method by the author which confirms that while dominately well mixed, Mississippi Sound also attains the characteristics of a partially mixed estuary and, highly localized, characteristics of a stratified estuary.

N2  - Species composition, abundance and seasonal variations of benthic macroinvertebrates in Simmons Bayou, Mississippi, and an adjoining dead-end canal were investigated from July 1976 through June 1977. Cluster analysis of the data summed over five stations indicated four major time periods: July, August-November, December-February, and March-June. Polychaetes and oligochaetes were most abundant in the winter and spring, amphipods in the summer, and chironomids in the spring. Temporal changes in abundance of polychaetes, oligochaetes, and chironomids appeared to reflect seasonal reproductive cycles. The peak in amphipod density corresponded with dense growths of Ruppia maritima. Within the dead-end canal, poor water quality and reduced infaunal densities appeared to be limitcd to the deeper water behind the sill.

N2  - The flux of suspended particulate organic detritus (POD) and suspended inorganic detritus (PID) was studied during ten diurnal tidal periods (24-hour) and three semidiurnal tidal periods (12-hour) between May 1975 and April 1976. The concentration of POD ranged from 1.50 to 19.79 mg/l, while the PID ranged from 3.20 to 99.61 mg/l. There was a net export of POD during four of 13 tidal periods and a net export of PID during five tidal periods. There was a total net movement of 39.32 and 292.51 kg of POD and PID, respectively, into the marsh. On an annual basis, this is equivalent to the addition of 168 g/m2/yr of detrital material to the marsh. The predictability of POD and PID concentration in the water was good (r2 of 57.9 and 58.1%) during ebb tide based on nine biological and physical variables. The ratio of POD to total suspended material was 15.9% and constant during the year at all concentrations. Although the marsh may not be an important source of carbon for the estuary, data indicate that the marsh may regulate the concentration of suspended detritus in the nearby bay by releasing detritus when the detritus concentration in the water is low and by accumulating detritus when this concentration is high.

N2  - Original work was carried on at the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries Laboratory on Apalachicola Bay from August 1935 to April 1936. Since then observations have been made in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Five papers on specific aspects of the biology of the animal have been written since on this and other predatory gastropods. Here all commentaries are drawn together and unpublished matter is presented. The name Thais haemastoma is used because separations based upon the rugosity of the shells do not hold up. Perfectly smooth and very rugose specimens are found in the same bays, with various shell characteristics being related to various oyster reefs on which they grow. Radular movement is by the band-over-pulley method suggested by Husley (1853), Herrick (1906) Gunter (1936) and Carriker (1943). Evidence is presented showing that Thais can kill oysters without mechanical injury, presumably by some paralytic material. About one-third of the oysters are opened by large Thais without any boring whatsoever. Smaller Thais are more prone to bore complete holes into the shell cavity of the prey. In Apalachicola Bay large Thais may eat one oyster about every 8 days and it was calculated that on St. Vincent’s Bar 24 million adult oysters could be killed in a year. The resting gonads consist of a thin layer of tissue on the body over the liver and they are lavender-grey in the males and yellowish-orange in the females. They begin to thicken in January and the color intensifies. Egg laying takes place from April to July on the Gulf coast. No young or small Thais were seen in Apalachicola Bay probably because of heavy freshwater drainage in the springs of 1934 and 1935. Several hundred Thais were measured and each month the length frequency mode was at 80.0 mm. The largest known specimen of Thais, a Louisiana specimen, was 103 mm long. A heavy kill of Thais took place in the spring of 1935 and no adults survived in Apalachicola Bay except on Hiles’ Bar near Indian Pass, which is close to the ocean. The Thais seemed to perish when salinity dropped to 9‰ and stayed that way for several weeks. Both oysters and mussels survived at salinities lower than Thais could withstand. Thais shells are extremely hard and are difficult to break with a hammer. Nevertheless, they are cracked by stone crabs. They are also invaded by commensals such as the boring clam

N2  - Recent papers by Eskinazi, compared to studies made on the Texas and Louisiana coasts 35 to 45 years ago and on the south Atlantic coast 15 years ago, show remarkable similarities of the estuarine fishes of northeastern Brazil and the northern Gulf of Mexico. Forty-five of 48 families of the two areas are in common and about 35% of the species are in common. On the west coast even greater correspondence might be expected between fishes of Peru and southern California, were it not for the restriction of tropical fishes by the Humboldt and California currents. When the lithospheric plate under North America pulled away from Pangaea, strong swimmers and pelagic fishes maintained connections. Thus, the marine fishes have had strong connections for the last 70 million years. Further, the Pacific and Atlantic faunas were connected until the mid-Pliocene when Isthmus America became continuous about 5.7 million years ago. Marine euryhaline fishes are much more abundant than their freshwater counterparts. Thus large numbers of marine fishes are found in the fresh waters of Panama. One hundred thirty-seven (137) marine fishes have been found there and 57 species have taken up more or less permanent residence. No freshwater fish have taken up residence in the seas of Panama. The freshwater fishes of Central America came from the south and their movement has been very slow. Isthmus America was a ridged mountainous area with short, small rivers and small basins. The estuaries were small or nonexistent. Thus, one avenue for spread of fishes from fresh water was generally nonexistent. There are 32 river basins in Panama and fish have little access from one to the other. So the river basins have an insular aspect. The Canal runs through only three river basins. There are generally no problems to the passage of freshwater fishes in the Canal but they are stopped by even low salinity and, if back pumping becomes necessary to maintain the lakes used in the operation of the locks, most freshwater fishes will not traverse the Canal. Thus, it may be said that there is little chance of transfer of freshwater fishes from one coast to the other. However, the tarpon has already crossed the isthmus and eight other species, including blennies, gobies and pipefishes, have made the passage according to ichthyological collectors. Actually only four fishes are indubitable crossers. Back pumping will increase the potentiality a great deal but

Its ultrastructure, unlike that of some other strains, does not reveal a distinct middle layer between its outer cell wall layer and cytoplasmic membrane, irregular blebs extending from the cell layers, or an external sheath. An entire infestation, represented as a mat of the bacterium with associated debris and microorganisms, sloughs from the shrimp when exposed to a variety of treatments. Primarily because most effective treatments are toxic to the shrimp, 100 ppm terramycin provides the treatment of choice.

N2  - The Mississippi River drains two thirds of the lower United States plus 13,000 square miles of Canada. When North America was being colonized by Europeans, the river overflowed its banks about once every 3 years and spread onto the floodplain, which today covers 34,600 square miles of the valley. A natural levee formed alongside the river where the silt was dropped when water left the channel; the levee now slopes away from the river at about 7 feet per mile. This high ground was settled first by the white man at New Orleans in 1717. The spring floods barely topped the natural levee and the original town was protected by a ring levee 3 feet high. As more overflow areas were cut off from the river, the levees increased in height to about 40 feet. The hydraulics of the river became better and today more water and silt flows out to sea. About three fourths of the floodplain is closed off from the river, but in 1882 and 1927, the river took that land back, and in 1973 almost 60% of the 22-million-acre area was flooded. Nevertheless, there have been no levee breaks since the Corps of Engineers took over flood control in 1928. The mean flow of the river since 1900 has been 646,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) moment to moment. The mode, median, quartiles and deciles of annual flows are given, and the measurements of dispersion, the standard deviation and coefficient of variation are given. The Atchafalaya River distributary has increased considerably at the expense of the Mississippi River since 1858. During the flood year of 1973, the Atchafalaya carried 37% of the total flow. It is estimated that unless it is brought under control, in about 60 years the Atchafalaya will equal the Mississippi. Flood years are not especially associated and in several cases low flows and flood years are close together. Measurements of river flows before 1900 are unreliable or absent. Since then, however, careful measurements of the daily flows of both distributaries have been taken by the Corps of Engineers and used to compile mean flows in cfs by years. The data extend for a series of 79 years. They were furnished to the author by the New Orleans District of the Corps. These data were used for all calculations given here on flows. The lowest flow recorded for the Atchafalaya was 13,300 cfs

Other food substrates contributed significantly to the diet. Marsh sediment was utilized by 37% of all snails observed to be feeding, while 4% grazed on live S. alterniflora. Algal mats, present on several occasions during the study, were utilized extensively. Comparison of microbial components in dead S. alterniflora and marsh sediment with those in the stomach and feces indicated that members of the microbial community of food substrates were assimilated.

N2  - Food production along sandy beaches is much different from that of rocky beaches. No large algae grow on sand beaches. Small filamentous green algae find footholds upon molluscs, mole crabs, strands of Leptogorgia and logs. Basic food along the sand beach is made up of diatoms, bacteria, unicellular algae and detritus; diatoms are probably the most abundant autotrophic organism; the beach bacteria are largely heterotrophic. Most food on sandy beaches comes from the sea. The sandy shore seems to be barren, but it swarms with plant and animal life. Food production has a seasonal aspect. Food strands more abundantly on sandy beaches because the force of water returning to the sea is much less than that coming in. Beach materials are concentrated in a strand line. All organic materials are returned to the food cycle. Beached animal remains are consumed immediately until their breakdown products ooze away to enrich the sand substrata. The materialof logs may not be redistributed until a number of years have passed. Food producing algae are diatoms, green algae, peridinians and blue-greens. Many of them are quite small and must be detected by bacteriological methods. They are probably quite significant. Food production from autotrophic algae appears to be relatively steady compared to drifting materials, which may vary enormously. Various types of food drift in as a result of dinoflagellate blooms, catastrophic cold kills and stranding cetaceans. Seasonal drifting materials such as sargassum, Leptogorgia and jellyfish come in at particular times of the year. The river mouth floods bring in material. The artificial jetsam of ships washes up on the beaches. Nutrients and salts are also concentrated on beaches from organic remains. As a result, a type of beach-hugging planktonic bloom has been noted on the Texas coast when the sea is calm following heavy rains. It consists of a yellowish-brown conglomeration of diatoms of the species Chaetoceras sp., 15 to 20 feet wide along the shore for many, many miles. It follows heavy rains and the event is parallel to some aspects of the Florida red tide which occurs in calm weather, often following heavy rains, which are thought to bring chelating substances from the land.

N2  - The gastropod genus Probythinella Thiele, 1928, is considered a senior synonym of Vioscalba Morrison, 1965. Probythinella louisianae (Morrison, 1965) n. comb. tentatively is recognized as a valid species distinct from the closely related P. lacustris (Baker, 1928) and P. protera Pilsbry, 1953. The eastern range of P. louisianae is extended to Mobile Bay, Alabama. Limited observations on the habitat and reproduction of P. louisianae are reported.

N2  - The neritic chaetognath Sagitta friderici Ritter-Zahony, 1911 was identified in plankton samples from the northern Gulf of Mexico in June 1974. Specimens analyzed from two groups of adults ranged from 6 to 13.7 mm long. Meristic values did not appear to be a function of body length except for individuals in the 12.4 to 13.7 mm range that had larger numbers of hooks and teeth. Adults of Sagitta friderici and the closely related S. tenuis Conant, 1896 were compared and found to be distinguishable chiefly by (1) the number of ova per unit length of the ovary, and (2) the arrangement of ova within the ovary. The TC values were highly variable and overlapping, thus casting doubt on the taxonomic importance of that characteristic. Sagitta friderici was abundant in inshore continental shelf waters where the salinity and temperature ranged from 24.9 to 33.9 ppt and 23.0 to 30.3°C, respectively. The failure to determine ecological boundaries between S. friderici and S. tenuis revealed a need for more intensive sampling in coastal regions of the Gulf of Mexico.

N2  - The numbers of enteric viruses and fecal coliform bacteria in oysters and water samples collected along the Mississippi Gulf coast during 1979 were determined. Ten viral isolates, representing members of the poliovirus group, were identified from an approved oyster harvesting site. The number of virus isolations increased to 51 when oysters were collected from a prohibited harvesting location. The majority of isolates were identified as poliovirus type 1 or 2, coxsackievirus B3 and B4, and echovirus type 24. Fecal coliforms in water samples collected at approved and prohibited locations confirmed the classification assigned to each area by the Mississippi State Board of Health. The numbers of fecal coliforms in oyster samples collected at the identical sites did not reflect the levels observed in water samples. There was no positive correlation between indicator bacteria in the water column and the number of viruses in the shellfish examined. These results imply that viral analyses of shellfish may be needed as an adjunct to bacteriological analyses so that shellfish safety is verified.

N2  - Over a 32-month study period, 154,469 fish representing 76 species were collected from the Gulf shore of Horn Island, Mississippi. Fishes collected were identified as either resident or migrant species according to length frequency data. The migrant component, dominated numerically by Anchoa lyolepis, represented the greatest number of species and individuals collected. Resident fishes constituted only six species but comprised 42.0% of all fish captured. The more abundant species residing within the Horn Island surf zone, Trachinotus carolinus, Menticirrhus littoralis, and Harengula jaguana, appeared to utilize this habitat as a nursery for approximately 3 months throughout the spring and summer period. Of these three residents, the two former species exhibited intermittent recruitment into the exposed beach habitat during the spring and early summer, whereas larval H. jaguana exhibited two distinct periods of immigration, occurring first in the late spring and again in midsummer.

N2  - Movements of mats of tidal wrack (dead Spartina alterniflora) and impacts of the wrack were followed in color infrared aerial photographs of a sloping foreshore salt marsh on Wallops Island, Virginia. Tidal wrack may be stranded in high marsh, where it decomposes, or it may be temporarily stranded at lower elevations. The wrack kills underlying Spartina alterniflora in low marsh and in the transition zone from low to high marsh. Wrack is the major cause of devegetated areas within the marsh, but these areas eventually revegetate, and do not evolve into pans. There are substantial short-term reductions in S. alterniflora marsh productivity. Other effects of wrack are discussed.

Sixteen of 43 species of fishes examined had natural gill infections of A. ocellatum. Seventy-one of 79 species of fishes exposed to A. ocellatum dinospores were susceptible, and succumbed, to the dinoflagellate. Eight did not die even though exposed to numerous dinospores. The most common signs in an infested fish were spasmodic gasping and uncoordinated movements. Trophonts of A. ocellatum were found on the gills, skin, fins, eyes, pseudobranchs, membranes of the branchial cavity and around the teeth; and in the lateral line pits, nasal passages, esophagus, and intestine of experimentally infected fishes. The dinoflagellate causes extensive mortalities of fishes held under closed-system mariculture conditions.

N2  - A new haustoriid amphipod, Lepidactylus triarticulatus n. sp., from the northern Gulf of Mexico is described and illustrated. The known range is from northern Padre Island, Texas, to Grand Isle, Louisiana. The species is ecologically plastic. On surf-exposed sandy beaches it is most abundant at the highest intertidal levels, but in fine-grained sands of wave-sheltered localities it occurs throughout the intertidal region into shallow subtidal depths. In central Texas bays it has been collected subtidally at salinities as low as 10 ppt. There are differences in morphological details of peraeopod 7 between the intertidal and subtidal populations which we regard as an ecotypic variation. A provisional generic characterization is given for the genus Lepidactylus Say.

N2  - A white shrimp from Galveston, Texas, is the first reported case of a crustacean internally infected by a diatom. Even though more than one species occurred in debris on and between gill filaments, only individuals of Amphora sp. occurred within gills. To determine if a related diatom would easily reproduce within the shrimp and cause. a host-response similar to that observed, we injected cultured specimens of A. coffaeformis into white shrimp. Under the experimental conditions, individuals of that species did not divide, but they elicited an extensive melanistic host-response.

N2  - Eimeria funduli occurred in Fundulus similis from Horn Island, Mississippi, during 1980, in contrast with its apparent absence during 1978 and 1979. Prevalence of the parasite appears to be related to the unusually low salinity in Mississippi Sound, and in ponds and off the beaches of Horn Island. The low salinity may have promoted the migration of infective intermediate hosts from inshore waters to the island.

N2  - Diplothyra smithii Tryon, a small bivalve mollusk, is a common inhabitant of the calcareous shell material of the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica Gmelin. Large populations of this clam are found on commercial oyster reefs in the western portion of Mississippi Sound. Several aspects of the population of D. smithii in Mississippi Sound were examined. On the Pass Marianne Reef, 71% of the live oysters and 44% of the dead shells were infested with D. smithii. The mean number of clams removed from valves of live oysters was 22.1 ± 1.7 (range, 1-109; N = 146). Infested dead shells had a mean number of 23.7 ± 2.6 (range, 1-103; N = 75) clams per shell. Clams from live and dead shells indicated monthly variations in morphological stages. During January through April, clams were predominantly immature. In late spring and early summer, clams matured morphologically. In May and June, the majority of clams were mature. Immature clams from early and midsummer spawnings appeared in July and August. Mean lengths and heights of clams with and without a callum and the monthly changes in those dimensions were determined for clams from live and dead shells. All clams from live oysters had greater mean dimensions and size ranges than clams from dead shells. Female clams were significantly larger than nonfemale clams from live oyster shells; females from dead shells were significantly larger than nonfemale clams in length only.

Complete larval development required about 15 days under culture conditions of 26.0° to 28.0°C and 25 ppt sea water. A long antenna and short antennal exopods consign E. limosum to the Group I xanthid zoeae of Rice (1980). The first stage zoea closely resembles that of Panopeus herbstii and is distinguished by having the dorsal spine strongly recurved at the extremity. Stages 2 to 4 are distinguished from Rhithropanopeus harrisii and Neopanope sayi larvae by having two lateral spines on the telson.

N2  - Vegetative development of shoots of the tidal marsh rush Juncus roemerianus was studied quantitatively in short (S) , medium (M), and tall-leaved (T) populations. Shoot longevity varied between populations, with some shoots producing one leaf and living 4 months, while others produced seven leaves and lived over 4 years. An equation was developed from plastochron and leaf-age determinations to estimate shoot age in each population studied. Major morphological events common to all populations were (1) cessation of growth of the first leaf produced on an erect stem when growth of the second leaf was initiated, and (2) death of the leaf from the tip downward. Although the time period was variable, growth rates of leaves equalled their death rates in each population during maximum periods of growth and subsequent decline. While growth and death rates were similar between two of the populations (M, T) investigated, these rates were vastly different from those representative of the third population (S). Growth and death kinetics for leaves on individual shoots involved cyclic phenomena represented by a series of greatly overlapping harmonic curves. Each shoot reached a maximum carrying capacity expressed as linear biomass. Although living portions were often distributed over three or four leaves, the total equated to two mature living leaves for the medium (M) and tall-leaved (T) populations. In the short-leaved population (S) , the maximum amount of biomass attained by a single shoot during its life span equalled that of one mature leaf. A peculiar steady-state or homeostasis in growth and net productivity exists in each population. Short-lived shoots in the short-leaved population (S) was shown to have a rapid turnover of replacement rate, which is responsible for a high net productivity equal to or exceeding the net productivity of both the medium and tall-leaved populations. Although the cause of variation in basic growth pattems between the three populations was not investigated, both genetic and environmental factors may be involved.

N2  - Plants of the salt marsh rush Juncus roemerianus were grown in deficient and complete nutrient solutions, and the growth responses were compared qualitatively and quantitatively. Plants grown in solutions deficient in K, S, P, and Mg were similar in appearance, which exemplified severe growth retardation. Plants grown in solutions deficient in Ca, N, and Fe also were very similar in total growth response, but had much longer leaves, more shoots, and greater biomass than those grown in the K, S, P, and Mg deficient solutions. Plants grown in complete nutrient solutions, with various sources of Fe, were very robust. Growth was better with FeCl3 than with FeEDTA. The most robust growth occurred in plants grown in the nutrient medium deficient in micronutrients (B, Mn, Zn, Cu, Mo), indicating that J. roemerianus is very sensitive to specific or certain combined micronutrients or concentrations generally recommended for terrestrial, especially agricultural, plants. The qualitative and quantitative symptoms, such as color, length, and abundance of leaves and roots as a response to deficiency of specific elements, were similar to those deficiency symptoms previously described for numerous terrestrial plants. However, a deficiency of certain nutrients such as S and Mg has a much greater effect on J. roemerianus than is generally shown for terrestrial plants.

N2  - Ichthyofaunal colonization of a new artificial reef was monitored from June 1975 through September 1977. Direct observations were accomplished using SCUBA. Theories of colonization and species equilibrium of islands and islandlike habitats were applied to the colonization data from the artificial reef. Sixty species of fishes from 33 families were recorded at the reef. Fifty-two percent of these species were primary reef fishes and 48% were secondary. Colonization data were produced only from the occurrence of primary reef fish. Data indicate that ichthyofaunal communities in the northern Gulf of Mexico are heavily influenced by seasonal changes in temperature, and that colonization by reef fish in that area does not conform to theories of immigration and extinction for island biotas. These results concur with similar work conducted on reef ichthyofauna in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

N2  - Ash and silica content and their depositional patterns in tissues of Spartina alterniflora Loisel., Distichlis spicata (L.) Greene, Scirpus validus Vahl., Zizania aquatica L., and Limonium carolinianum (Walt.) Britt. were determined. Zizania aquatica leaves had the highest silica content (6.0%) of any of the plant parts tested; silica making up over half of the ash. Silica in the plants was opaline in character. Limonium carolinianum did not accumulate silica in any great amount. However, ash content was very high in Limonium carolinianum and Scirpus validus making up over 17% of the dry weight of the leaves. X-ray diffraction showed the presence of halite (NaCl) and calcium sodium phosphate (2.4 CaO • 0.6 Na2O • P2Os) in the ash of the leaves of all the plants from Mississippi except Zizania aquatica. Mineral deposition (silica and other minerals) in Zizania aquatica occurs in rows lengthwise of the leaf, and there are bowtie- and oval-shaped phytoliths. In Distichlis spicata leaves, mineral deposits occur in rows of elongate, serrated units. Spongy mineral deposition occurs lengthwise of the leaves of Spartina alterniflora and some of these deposits, including the silica, are fibrous. In Scirpus validus heavy deposits occur lengthwise of the leaf. Silica occurs in a sheetlike pattern and in rows of oval particles.

Records are given of freshwater turtles and of the gopher tortoise in low-salinity waters. These include the Florida cooter Pseudemys floridana, the snapping turtle Chelydra serpentina, the alligator snapper Macroclemys temmincki, and the gopher Gopherus polyphemus. The diamondback terrapin Malaclemys terrapin pileata is common in brackish waters of Alabama and Mississippi. All sea turtles of the western Atlantic Ocean may be expected in Mississippi waters except for the Pacific ridley Lepidochelys olivacea, indigenous in northern South America in the Atlantic.

N2  - Benthic community structure in St. Louis Bay was studied for 23 months. Cluster analyses distinguished two habitats: open water areas and areas near the marshy shores of rivers and bayous. Two groups of “euryhaline opportunistic” species were dominant at the open water stations. Temporal patterns of the “euryhaline opportunists,” which appeared to be controlled by a combination of reproductive pulses and seasonally intense predation, showed that the greatest abundance of macroinfauna occurred during the cooler months with reduced recruitment during the second year. The river-bayou stations were characterized by two groups of “estuarine endemic” species. One of these groups was most abundant in the warmer months and the other in the cooler months. Changes in abundance of the “estuarine endemics” appeared to reflect seasonal cycles.

N2  - The feeding habits of five nominal subspecies of clapper rails (Rallus longirostris Boddaert) collected in tidal marshes along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the United States are compared. Data on the food from the stomachs of 183 rails were analyzed and the earlier literature critically reviewed. During the warmer months (May through early fall), crabs, predominantly Uca spp., comprised the major part of the food items found. Limited data on a few rails collected during late fall and winter, when Uca spp. are not usually available, indicate that snails then become a major part of the clapper rail’s diet during that part of the year. Earlier studies, which describe the food or feeding habits of clapper rails, are reviewed and the food habits and trophic relationships of some other tidal marsh consumers are discussed. Data from this and previous studies indicate that clapper rails are opportunistic omnivores, and occupy a relatively broad niche within tidal marsh ecosystems. A comparison of available data of the food of five clapper rail subspecies of the eastern United States indicates no distinct differences in their feeding behavior. Differences in the kinds of food eaten appear to simply reflect the types of marsh habitat (fresh, brackish, polyhaline) or geographical location (temperate, subtropical, tropical) in which a particular clapper rail population occurs. The food habits of the king rail are compared with those of the clapper rail and problems concerning the taxonomic status of the “subspecies” of Rallus longirostris are briefly discussed.

N2  - Specific dietary contents from six fishes collected in Mississippi Sound are recorded. In order of their importance, primary components grouped in major taxonomic categories were fishes, penaeid shrimps, and other crustaceans for Cynoscion nebulosus; Crustaceans and fishes for C. arenarius; fishes and crustaceans for C. nothus; crustaceans, pelecypods, and polychaetes for Pogonias cromis; crustaceans, molluscs, polychaetes, and fishes for Archosargus probatocephalus; and fishes and penaeid shrimps for Paralichthys lethostigma. Principal items in the diets of most of the fishes included Anchoa mitchilli, Penaeus aztecus, P. setiferus, and Callinectes sapidus. Those crustaceans show that competition exists for commercial shellfishes in Mississippi Sound. Ratios among the different dietary items vary, according at least to species of fish, length of fish, season, specific location, and abundance of available prey. Some of these variations are documented and are additionally related to selected findings by other authors sampling different localities. We suggest that examination of food items in Archosargus probatocephalus can serve as a practical means to sample and assess seasonal prevalence and abundance of a wide range of invertebrates throughout different habitats in Mississippi Sound and elsewhere.

N2  - Three systems (flow-through, static, and recirculating) for intensive culture of the Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) for bait were evaluated. The outdoor recirculating system proved most successful. Killifish maintained in this system attained an average weight of over 2.0 gm in 42 days, an acceptable market size. Whereas the solar-heated recirculating system sustained fish densities equivalent to 1,000,000/ha and a survival rate of 86%, growth of killifish in this system was less than that observed in both the static and outdoor recirculating systems. Algae appeared to be an important nutritional component of the diet of juvenile killifish. Individuals of F. grandis fed diets supplemented with algae grew better than those maintained without them.

These two specimens were compared to the four described species of Lightiella, and found to be most similar to the northeastern Atlantic species of L. incisa Gooding, 1963 and L. floridana McLaughlin, 1976. Due to a combination of differences in the thoracopodal setation and incisor process of the mandible, the Mobile Bay form cannot at this time be assigned to any of the described species of Lightiella. The two Mobile Bay specimens may represent an undescribed species or an ecophenotypic variant of L. incisa, but until more specimens from Mobile Bay and adjacent waters are available for study, no conclusions can be made on specific identity of this form. Interpretive problems concerning morphological characters of the Mobile Bay specimens and previously described species of Lightiella are briefly discussed.

N2  - The Least Tern is among the smallest of the long-winged flyers and an indescribably ethereal impression emanates from it in flight. Thus great interest was generated when this tern began to nest on the mainland beach of Mississippi Sound about 12 years ago. In 1980, Least Tern chicks died in numbers on the beach and this generated considerable comment and some bombast. An upstate ornithologist announced that poison in the food chain was the cause, but no poison has ever been found in the carcasses of the dead chicks or in the water. The mortality of Least Tern chicks was not caused by Red Tide or disease and by a simple process of exclusion fell to the hottest summer the author ever saw on the Gulf Coast in 51 years, with air temperatures up to 107°F.

N2  - The albuneid mole crab, Zygopa michaelis Holthuis, 1960, which was originally described from Curaçao and recently reported from the Florida East coast (Gore and Becker 1977), is reported from the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida West coast. Of the seven specimens collected, six were taken in 38 m of water off Fort Myers and one in 42 m on the Florida Middle Ground. All seven specimens occurred in substrata composed primarily of carcareous sand.

N2  - Elevations of lowest colonization of smooth cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, were surveyed along the edge of a juvenile salt marsh at Wallops Island, Virginia. This lowest limit of Spartina varied over one-third of the local mean tidal range, with lowest occurrences between mean low water and mean low water neaps. Four geographical factors appeared to influence the lowest limit of Spartina: (1) tidal scouring in areas where tidal channels were constricted, (2) scalloping of the marsh edge over a sloping substrate, (3) patterns of historical development of the marsh, and (4) ice scouring of previously colonized Spartina over winter. Marsh edge scallops occurred only in areas of former Spartina thatch islands, and probably resulted from lateral spreading of those islands.

N2  - Marsh periwinkles of 5 to 7 mm in shell height were eaten regularly by blue crabs. Fractures marking unsuccessful crab attacks were present in about 25% of medium-sized (10-16 mm) snails and over 60% of larger snails (over 16 mm). Medium-sized snails, subject to predation, leave the water more frequently than larger snails, but only about a quarter of the snail population leaves the water during high tide. We found no evidence that the snails leave the water because they sense blue crabs in the water.

N2  - In the southeastern United States, the snail Thais haemastoma has traditionally been subdivided into two subspecies according to the snail‘s locale, size of shell, number and size of spines, and depth of suture. Only Thais haemastoma floridana is supposed to occur in Georgia; since Thais haemastoma canaliculata is supposedly restricted to the Gulf of Mexico region. In Georgia, specimens fitting the description of both subspecies are common. The author concurs with the conclusions of Butler (1953) and Gunter (1979) in that the subspecies nomenclature is invalid and that they are merely ecological variants.

N2  - A multilinear regression analysis of water temperature, salinity, and number of postlarval brown shrimp in nursery areas was used to predict the June and July commercial harvest of brown shrimp in Mississippi waters. A total of 80.2% of the variation in harvest was accounted for by this model. When an effort variable was added to the equation, the amount of variation explained by these parameters increased to 85.4%. The coefficients of the two multilinear equations were recalculated exclusive of the data set for the last year to test the predictive capabilities of the models. For that year, the first model showed a percent error of 38.2%, and the second model, 35.3%.

N2  - Littorina irrorata varies over its geographic range in maximum size, preferred elevations relative to tidal datum planes, and in the type of vegetation it inhabits. On Wallops Island, Virginia, postlarvae of Littorina irrorata with shell lengths < 5 mm long live almost exclusively in dead, curled-up leaves of Spartina alterniflora at elevations near mean tide level, below elevations occupied by larger conspecifics. Snails longer than 5 mm in length increase in average size with decreasing elevation. This distribution is opposite to that found by Hamilton (1978) in a marsh in Florida. No difference was found in our study area in growth rate of marked snails at two different elevations, so the size-elevation gradient probably is not caused by differences in growth rate. Snails 15 to 19 mm long are more active when exposed to reduced salinities than snails > 21 mm long. The lowest salinities recorded in the marsh occurred at the highest elevations. This salinity effect, together with mortality from known size-selective predators, may account, at least in part, for the seaward increase in mean shell size.

N2  - A study of the benthos of southern Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana, was conducted from July 1976 to July 1978. Seven offshore stations and three stations in the New Orleans Marina complex were sampled seasonally. Offshore stations formed a transect from the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway to the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal (I.H.N.C.). A west to east gradient of increasing salinity and salinity stratification was evident. Faunal differences among stations were assessed using indices of diversity, biological dominance, pollution, and station homogeneity. The fauna of the marina stations had a low species diversity and was dominated by annelids, indicative of a stressed environment. The fauna of stations near the I.H.N.C. were similar to the marina stations. Moving westward from the I.H.N.C., species diversity increased and the fauna became dominated by mollusks. Stressful conditions associated with the intrusion of water from the I.H.N.C. into Lake Pontchartrain appeared to be responsible for the faunal differences observed.

Data from shell bags that accompanied the spat plates indicated a maximum growth of 3.2 cm in two months. Oyster spat which attached to the planted cultch materials on the leases grew up to 7.9 cm during the 17-month sampling period, ending December 11, 1979. The lease area is capable of producing commercial-sized oysters in two seasons.

N2  - In 1902 and 1903 G. von Bunge and A. B. Macallum became impressed independently with the similarity between the salt content of ocean water and vertebrate blood. Von Bunge’s ideas concerned NaCl and were stated in a physiology text. Macallum’s ideas, related mostly to the proportions of Na, K, and Ca in sea water and blood, were set forth in a series of papers ending in 1926. Bayliss (1927) and Pearse and Gunter (1957) accepted this thesis. Conway (1943, 1945) questioned it on the grounds that the salts from land erosion do not correspond to those in the sea. However, Rubey (1951) has shown that sea salt has come from the deep Earth rather than erosion. All ensuing discoveries have corresponded to that idea. As a side issue, the theory of the freshwater origin of fishes has succumbed to a large number of questioning papers. Now the von Bunge-Macallum theory is generally unquestioned.

N2  - The gonadal development of Polymesoda caroliniana in an irregularly flooded, brackish marsh was followed for 13 months. Ripe individuals (condition prior to spawning) were found in May, July, August, and October, suggesting either an extended period of spawning or three discrete spawning periods. This pattern is different from another study of P. caroliniana in a more flooded habitat. The observed gonadal condition correlates with the presence of newly recruited clams in the marsh during most of the year, but failed to explain a pulse of juveniles found in February. The different reproductive pattern observed in this brackish marsh may be either a genetic or physiological adaptation to life in an unpredictably flooded marsh.

These core samples were examined for resting egg density and size. Resting egg density decreased exponentially from the surface down to 7 cm in the sediments at all stations, with depth in the sediments accounting for 42.3% of the total variance. The maximum resting egg density recorded was 194 RE/cm3 with no significant differences in density among stations. Resting eggs were found to be significantly larger in the top 2 cm of sediment than resting eggs from deeper in the sediments. These data are discussed with regard to other work on resting egg densities in natural populations. Hypotheses are offered to explain the observed decrease in resting egg size with depth in sediments.

N2  - The first few launches of the space shuttle resulted in fish kills in a lagoon near the launch site. To study this phenomenon further, sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus), sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna), and mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) were exposed to the exhaust plume in buckets placed near the launch site. An open bucket provided a full exposure, a partly closed one provided an intermediate exposure, and a closed one was the control. Three h after launch, the pH of the water from the full exposure had decreased from about 7 to about 3, Al and Fe levels had increased, and some fish had died. Gills ol most fishes from full exposures and some from intermediate exposures were damaged. Gills, however, exhibited no aneurysms, mucus coagulation, or hemorrhaging. Some secondary lamellae swelled, some fused with adjacent lamellae, and others clubbed or retracted into the filament. Many lamellar pavement cells died and sloughed off. Mucous cells of intermediate exposure specimens bulged on the filament surface and pavement cells lost their microridges. Mineral deposits, probably aluminum oxide, occurred on gills of fishes from full exposures. Focally, pavement cells were eroded exposing the underlying structures. The sudden pH drop in the full exposures probably caused the gill damage. However, we could not determine the effect of previous exposure on the experimental fish, or whether gill damage was the lethal lesion. The possibility is indicated that some fish recover after exposure to the exhaust plume.

N2  - Synaphobranchid eels of the Gulf of Mexico are an important part of the upper continental slope ichthyofauna, occurring most frequently between 500 and 1,500 m. Two of the four known genera (Histiobranchus and Diastobranchus) have not been reported from the Gulf. Synaphobranchidae tend to occur within a narrow range of temperatures compared to the North Atlantic synaphobranchid eels. However, distribution of these eels in the deeper parts of the Gulf appears to be correlated more to change in depth than to temperature, salinity, or dissolved oxygen. The distribution at the shallower limits of their depth range appear to be a result of synergistic effects of the dissolved oxygen demand and the change in temperature. The synaphobranchid eels&#039; apparent preferences for particular types of substrata are probably associated with the organisms preyed on rather than direct selection of bottom type by the eels. These eels are opportunistic feeders, feeding primarily on fish, squid, and crustaceans. Synaphobranchidae are frequently infested with parasites, but there do not appear to be any serious abnormal morphological results.

N2  - Effects of fertilizer, elevation, and tidal inundation on seedling establishment of Spartina alterniflora and Spartina patens were tested at a wave-protected sandy dredged material site, Galveston Bay, Texas. No seedlings that grew from sown seeds became established at elevations below 36 cm (msl) while the greatest number established in the upper tier. Seedlings of S. alterniflora were more numerous than S. patens in the upper and middle tiers. Naturally occurring seedlings of S. alterniflora, which apparently germinated from seeds produced on transplants in adjacent plots, established at all elevations of the site during winter. The average time of tidal inundation at a particular elevation was less during winter than spring. Thus, establishment of plants by seed at low intertidal elevations appears feasible only during low seasonal winter tides and with S. alterniflora. Fertilizers did not enhance growth, and high concentrations of fertilizer caused stress to some S. alterniflora seedlings.

N2  - A new species of benthic amphipod, Ampelisca parapacifica, is described from the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and compared with the closely allied Ampelisca pacifica Holmes, 1908, from the eastern Pacific. The distinctive form of the third uropod separates this species pair from other members of the "macrocephala" subgroup of the genus Ampelisca Kroyer, 1842. Ampelisca parapacifica is distinguished from A. pacifica by antenna I peduncle segment 2 less t}an twice the length of article 1 and uropod I peduncle shorter than the rami. Previous Atlantic records of A. pacifica are assigned to the proposed new species. The Pacific populations of A. eschrichtii pacifica Gurjanova, 1955, were elevated to the species rank by Karaman, unaware that the name A. pacifica was preoccupied. A substitute name, A. karamani, nomen novum, is designated for the form described by Gurjanova.

N2  - Juncus roemerianus generally occupies the upper half of the intertidal plane and covers about 92% or 25,000 hectares of marsh in Mississippi. The vegetative canopy is best described as a series of disjunct and intergrading populations. Considerable phenotypic variation and differences in standing crop exist between populations. J. roemerianus has very wide environmental tolerances in comparison to all other tidal marsh angiosperms. Soil types inhabited by the rush range from very sandy to highly organic muds and peats, which may vary in the concentration of nutrient elements (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium). Neither soil type, nutrient concentration, water content, pH nor elevation can be used to distinguish the habitat of J. roemerianus, because similar conditions are found in areas occupied by pure or almost pure monotypic stands of other plant species. Soil water salinity is cyclic in all populations of J. roemerianus examined and salinity appears to be the major edaphic factor affecting growth and distribution of the rush. The greatest concentration and fluctuation of salt content occurs in the near-surface soil layer and the lowest concentration of salt and most stable soil water regime occurs at increasingly lower depths. Experimental evidence indicates that the rush grows best in fresh water, without competition, and cannot tolerate continuous salinities greater than 30 ppt. Soil organisms which detrimentally affect the rhizomes are major factors limiting distribution of the rush into freshwater areas. Salt concentrations in the soil solution of 35-360 ppt occurs frequently in some near-surface marsh soil layers. J. roemerianus growing on "salt flats" apparently survives near-surface hypersaline soil water (90-360 ppt) because of deeply penetrating, specialized roots. About five billion seeds of J. roemerianus are produced annually in Mississippi tidal marshes, but few rush seedlings are found. Germination requires light, and seedling establishment is the vulnerable stage in the life cycle of the species. Vigorous mature stands are maintained by rhizome growth and the frequent removal of dead-standing leaves by physical factors such as storms, heavy rains, tides, and currents.

N2  - The bivalve Mulinia lateralis is a dominant member of estuarine benthos, but its presence and abundance in Georgia estuarine waters is sporadic over time. Recruitment and production was monitored from 1977 through 1981 at three inner and one outer more saline ( > 18 ppt) areas of Wassaw Sound. Until the winter of 1981, Mulinia lateralis was absent or at very low densities. Significant settlement occurred in January 1981 when densities in the outer sound reached as high as 63,000 individuals • m-2). The clam was more abundant in sandy mud (x̄ = 10,161 • m-2) than mud (x̄=277 • m-2) or sand (x̄=263 • m-2).Cohort production varied from 0.3 g dry wt • m-2 • 4 months-1 in the inner sound to 325 g dry wt • m-2 • 7 months-1 in the outer Sound, with the mean biomass ranging from 0.6 to 513 g dry wt • m-2, respectively. When present, Mulinia lateralis contributes significantly to benthic production available to commercially valuable fish and crabs. That this food resource is annually and seasonally episodic could contribute to year-to-year fluctuations in production of species preying on benthos.

N2  - Rodlet cell ultrastructure was studied in normal and cadmium-damaged kidney tissues of the spot Leiostomus xanthurus, an estuarine teleost. Rodlet cells in control fish occurred in all parts of the nephron except the renal corpuscle, were oblong to pear-shaped (about 5x10 µm), and contained up to 30 rodlet bodies, a basally situated nucleus, poorly developed mitochondria, and a filamentous cortex. Desmosomes and tight junctions joined rodlet cells to kidney epithelial cells. After cadmium exposure, rodlet cells showed a range of responses from secretory stimulation to necrosis. Rodlet bodies, which were membrane-bound, club-shaped granules, were secreted by a merocrine process, apparently aided by contraction of the fllamentous cortex. New rodlet bodies were assembled in the Golgi apparatus. Mitochondria hypertrophied and developed well-defined cristae. The ultrastructural organization of the rodlet cells in this study and their responses to stimuli suggest that these are tissue or host cells rather than parasites as proposed by some authors. Further studies, however, are needed to confirm the nature of these cells.

N2  - It has been shown within the past 70 years that salinity and thus density inversions are often detectible in shallow bays and estuaries. This terminology means that surface salinities are sometimes higher than those at lower depths. The first such discoveries in this country were made by Sumner, Louderback, Schmitt and Johnston (1914) in San Francisco Bay. They used Negetti-Zambta reversing thermometers for temperature and silver nitrate titration for salinity determination. These were by then considered to be classical methods and had been worked out in northern Europe, mostly in Scandinavia. They were introduced to the United States Gulf Coast and the authors in 1931 by Frank W. Weymouth, of Stanford University, who headed the Shrimp Investigations of the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries from 1930, which were later taken over by Milton J. Lindner.

Individuals were collected from a brackish J. roemerianus marsh in St. Louis Bay, Mississippi, (30o22&#039;N, 89o15&#039;W) during the period of June 1979 to May 1980. Adults with eggs were first noted in early January and increased in number through May. Brooded young were observed from late January through May. Habitat comparisons are made between this and other North American and European populations. The present population is associated with lower salinities, more sandy sediments, and much less frequent tidal inundation than the others. A brief taxonomic discussion is presented.

N2  - About 3,000 specimens of the spotted seatrout from Mississippi Sound and adjacent water grouped by males and females had a nearly identical standard length (SL) versus total length (TL) relationship, although the equation for males in winter differed from that for those in other seasons. When investigating the SL-weight relationship, some differences occurred both among seasons and between sexes. Therefore, condition coefficients (K) were calculated to compare male and female groups according to their length and state of maturation on a seasonal basis. The hepatosomatic index (HSI) tended to increase with fish length, with relatively high values occurring in winter compared to low ones in summer when livers exhibited an abundance of lipid. Seasonal values of gonosomatic index (GSI) were typically less than those for HSI, except for ripe or nearly ripe fish. Males and females often concurrently exhibited contrasting values for both HSI and GSI. Females matured as short as 189 mm SL and males by 201 mm, and the percentage of gravid females in summer increased with increasing SL. By the time fish reached 40 cm, females constituted 85.7% of the sample from Mississippi Sound, not counting additional samples in 1982 that contained more males between 350 and 475 mm than females. Ovaries contained more oocytes than indicated in the literature. The largest estimate of oocytes over 30 μm in diameter per female was ten and one-half million using a simple volumetric displacement method, or fifteen and one-half million when calculated using a gravimetric technique. Based on histological and other evidence, most individual fish in Mississippi apparently spawned periodically from April to September and even longer during years with appropriate temperature conditions. When gravid, fish tended to group in schools composed primarily of males or females. Tagging studies indicated that neither C. nebulosus nor C. arenarius moved farther than 25 km from their location of release. Both seatrouts hosted parasites that harm the host in natural water and culture conditions, that adversely affect their respective fisheries, and that potentially cause human distress. Several listed parasites had not been reported previously from the fishes.

N2  - Several hundred specimens of the red drum from Mississippi were critically assessed. Regression equations for standard-length (SL) versus total-length differed between males and females and between small and large members of the same sex. A single regression line represented the weight-SL relationship for males with females. For condition coefficients to be helpful, fish had to be grouped at least by sex, season, and length or stage of maturity. By 12 months of age, most fish were about 30 to 32 cm SL and their distribution ranged throughout Mississippi Sound rather than being restricted to inshore bayou and marsh habitats like younger individuals. Juvenile fish tended to have a high hepatosomatic index (HSI) in winter, and adults had a low one following spawning. The gonosomatic index (GSI) was typically lower than the HSI except for gravid fish in spring and summer. The number of oocytes available for spawning appeared to be much higher than cited in previous reports. The highest calculated fecundity, occurring in a 758 mm SL fish, was 62 million using a volumetric displacement method and 95 million using a gravimetric one. Extrapolated estimates for larger fish were much higher. Resting and yolk-vesicle stage oocytes typically had an irregular shape, an eccentrically located nucleus, and an abundance of highly basophilic substance in the ooplasm. Throughout a seasonal histological examination, both gonads contained, often in an abundance, Periodic-acid-Schiff-positive granular leukocytes. Spawning took place in late September and October one year, but apparently has occurred over longer periods when conditions of temperature and photoperiod were appropriate. No tagged, 1-year-old fish were returned from farther than 33 km from the point of release. Adults, however, apparently migrated extensively, especially from October through April. Those adults tagged several km south of the barrier islands included individuals caught 778 km away in Texas after 746 days and 316 km away in Florida after 399 days. Another fish apparently migrated at least 120 km in inshore waters in 6 days or fewer. An estimated 25 million kg or more of red drum occurred at one time between the Mississippi River and Mobile Point, Alabama. The red drum served as a host for a variety of parasites, some capable of having an adverse effect on natural stocks, on cultured stocks, and on seafood consumers, and most species known to infect the drum are listed in a table. The red drum has succumbed to some microbial agents,

N2  - The physical and chemical characteristics of soil from four widely separated Juncus roemerianus populations in Mississippi tidal marshes are determined. The J. roemerianus populations studied are located in Grand Bayou, Salt Flats, Weeks Bayou,and Belle Fantaine marshes. Organic matter, pH, CEC, N, P, K, Ca, S, Mg, and Zn analyses are based on composite soil samples. The percentage of sand, silt, and clay of the marsh soils is determined along with soil water content from the four locations. Statistical analysis indicates which marshes are different for each soil characteristic tested. No appreciable amounts of organic matter are present in the soils from Grand Bayou and the Salt Flats, however, the soils of Weeks Bayou and Belle Fontaine marsh are highly organic. Magnesium is significantly different among all locations. Concentrations of P are greatest in the marsh sails from Grand Bayou and lowest in the Salt Flats. Greater values are recorded for organic matter, CEC, N, K, Ca, S, Mg, and Zn in the Weeks Bayou and Belle Fontaine marsh soils than are recorded for the sails at Grand Bayou and Salt Flats. The results of the soil analyses show that tidal marsh soils vary considerably in physical and chemical characteristics among locations, and J. roemerianus is able to grow well in a variety of soil types.

N2  - The Biitish tanker M/T ALVENUS ran aground 16.1 km south of Cameron, Louisiana, on 30 July 1984. An estimated 10,157 MT of Venezuelan crude oil were spilled into the Gulf of Mexico. Approximately 2,700 MT of the heavy viscous oil impacted beaches and an additional 1,360 MT remained in the subtidal areas of west Galveston Island, about 160 km southwest of the accident site. Red drum, which spawn in the Gulf of Mexico in the fall, could have been seriously impacted by oil concentrations potentially lethal to eggs or larvae. The impact of weathered crude oil on the survival, growth, and morphological development of red drum eggs and larvae was assessed in the laboratory. Equal numbers of eggs were randomly assigned to one of six treatments of weathered crude oil (control, 50, 100, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 mg/l) and observed through the yolk-sac stage. There were no differences in mean survival, length of surviving larvae, and frequency of morphological abnormalities among treatments (α < 0.05). In addition, the frequency of spinal deformity and abnormal mouth development was low in all treatments. The initial chemical composition of the fresh crude oil and the seasonally warm weather contributed to the natural degradation of the soluble toxic components.

N2  - Primary production and respiration rates were determined for two epiphytic communities associated with Spartina alternifloraLoisel., in the southwestern Barataria Bay area of Louisiana. The communities studied were: (1) a shoreline community and (2) a community 1.5 meters inland from the shoreline site. Annual mean net production and respiration rates for the shoreline community were 25.8 and -19.6 mg C • (m2 substrate area)-1 • h-1 respectively;whereas the inland community showed corresponding rates of -3.3 and -12.5 mg C • (m2 substrate area)-1 • h-1, respectively. Thus, the shoreline community was a net contributor to system production; the inland community was an energy sink. The inland community was elevated 15 to 20 cm above the shoreline community, lacked the conspicuous filamentous algal growth common at the shoreline location, and had a significantly smaller diatom population. The role of epiphytes is speculated to be one of quality rather than quantity production.

N2  - Soil characteristics from five adjacent monotypic zones or different populations of tidal marsh plants are determined. Populations of Spartina alterniflora, Spartina patens, Juncus roemerianus, Scirpus olneyi, and Distichlis spicata located in Graveline Bay marsh, Mississippi, are studied. Slight elevational differences between the plant populations exist. The aerial biomass for each plant population is different based on seasonal determinations. Soil pH, organic matter, N, P, K, S, Zn, Ca, and Mg concentrations are based on analyses of seasonal composite soil samples. Analyses of soil water samples are used to determine water content, salinity, PO4, and NH3. The soil characteristics are highly variable within and among populations. Some soil properties are significantly different, while others are not. These results reflect the complex patterns in the physical and chemical soil characteristics among the salt marsh plant populations studied; however, they may not completely account for the differences in standing crop or the sharp delineation between plant zones.

N2  - Examination of several collections of barnacles from the northern and western Gulf of Mexico made over the last 30 years has improved our knowledge of the distributions of several taxa previously considered to be absent or rare in those regions. Conchoderma auritum (Linnaeus) and Heteralepas sp. aff. cornuta (Darwin) are recorded for the first time from the Gulf of Mexico. Conchoderma auritum, Conchoderma virgatum (Spengler), Heteralepas cornuta (Darwin), Balanus trigonus (Darwin), Balanus venustus Darwin, and Balanus amphitrite amphitrite Darwin have broad distributions outside the Gulf of Mexico. Tetraclita stalactifera stalactifera (Lamarck) is abundant in the intertidal zones of the southwestern Gulf, but rare elsewhere in the Gulf of Mexico outside the Florida Keys. Spatial segregation of Octolasmis hoeki (Stebbing) and Octolasmis lowei (Darwin) on a host crab is discussed.

N2  - The importance of spatial influences on seasonal fluctuations in Thalassia testudinum leaf blade lengths and chemical constituents was demonstrated. Differences between samples from fringe and mid-bed for several constituents were significant and, if not accounted for, could affect the measurement of apparent seasonal cycles. Fringe-shoots, reflecting the influence of more intense grazing activity, had shorter leaf blade lengths, lower dry weights and carbohydrate levels, and higher protein levels than mid-bed shoots. Mid-bed rhizomes and roots had highest protein and ash levels reflecting possible sediment influence. Percent ash and protein in the rhizomes, and percent carbohydrate in the roots exhibited seasonal fluctuations, but the levels were different between fringe and mid-bed samples. Protein levels were greatest in shoots and roots, while carbohydrate levels were highest in rhizomes, illustrating the respective partitioning of biosynthetic and storage functions. The spatial differences seem to reflect gradients in biological and chemical interactions, and they may play an important role in trophic interactions in seagrass systems.

Testis-ova were observed in three of 24 spawning males exhibiting otherwise normal male morphology. The testis-ova appeared non-vitellogenic and lacked a follicle cell layer. It is speculated that the testis-ova did not become vitellogenic due to their association with Sertoli cells and the hormonal environment of the male.

N2  - Two new species of tanaidaceans belonging to the family Leptocheliidae were collected from the continental shelves and slopes of the eastem and Gulf coasts of the United States. Both of these species are assigned to the poorly known genus Mesotanais Dollfus, 1897. Mesotanais is unique within the Leptocheliidae because its members lack eyes. The second supposedly important generic character, uniramous uropods, reported in the original description is considered to be a misdiagnosis. The assumption of this error is supported by the rediscovery of the type-species, Mesotanais dubius Dollfus, 1897 (Sieg and Bird, in press). In the present study, the genus Mesotanais is rediagnosed and the two new species from the western Atlantic are described. Mesotanais longisetosus n. sp. can be distinguished from M. vadicola n. sp. by a variety of characters including the much longer terminal setae on antenna 1, the distinctly more elongate carpus of the cheliped, and the shape of the pars molaris of the mandible. Mesotanais longisetosus appears to be closely related to the type-species, M. dubius known from the eastern Atlantic. It is distinguished from M. dubius by having an elongate distal seta on the carpus and more styliform dactylus of the first peraeopod, and by the presence of two short, distal, tergal spines on the merus of peraeopods 4-6. Mesotanais vadicola occurred at depths of 22-865 m, while M. longisetosus was collected mainly from the upper continental slope at depths of 545-1386 m. Between 500 m and 900 m there is a broad area of overlap in the distribution of the two species, but with increasing depth M. vadicola is replaced by M. longisetosus.

Atlantapseudes lindae can be distinguished from the only other member of the genus, A. nigrichela Băcescu, 1978 by several characters, including the length of the squama of antenna 2, which is no longer than the third peduncular segment, and the absence of anterolateral spines on pereonites 1-2 of females and 1-6 on males. The diagnosis for genus Atlantapseudes Băcescu, 1978 is amended to include the presence of sexually dimorphic chelae and first antennae in fully developed males.

N2  - Pseudosphyrapus siegi, n. sp. is described from benthic samples collected in deep water (595-2400 m) from the northern Gulf of Mexico. Of the five currently recognized species of Pseudosphyrapus Cup, 1980, P. siegi is most closely related to P. dispar (Lang, 1968), a southwestem Pacific cognate and only other member of the genus having a squama on antenna 2. Pseudosphyrapus siegi is distinguished from P. dispar by: (1) a more triangular, but less acute, rostrum (2) the presence of two 4-pronged spines on the second maxilla (homologous spines on P. dispar are 3-pronged), and (3) the absence of a spiniform process on the chelipedal carpus. Other less noticeable differences between the two species occur in the setation or spination of the maxilliped and pereopods. Except for a small genital cone on males and developing oostegites on females, no noticeable sexual dimorphism (e.g., setation of antenna 1, enlargement or modification of chela and pereopod 1 in males) was exhibited by the specimens of P. siegi examined. It is probable, however, that more fully developed and sexually dimorphic males exist for P. siegi. The limited collection data suggests that body size in P. siegi may increase with depth. A key to the species of the genus Pseudosphyrapus is included.

Of the species presently assigned to the genus Calliax de Saint Laurent, 1973, C. jonesi appears to be most closely related to C. quadracuta (Biffar, 1970), presently known from the Atlantic coast of Venezuela and the Florida Keys. Calliax jonesi is distinguished from C. quadracuta by: (1) the absence of a distal spinose process on the dorsal and ventral margins of the carpus of the first pair of chelipeds, (2) the armature and shape of uropods and telson, and (3) the shape of male first pleopod. Calliax jonesi, C. quadracuta, and at least two undescribed species from the northwestern Atlantic appear to form a closely related species complex which may not be congeneric with the type species, C. lobata (de Gaillande & Lagardère, 1966), and other species assigned to Calliax.

N2  - Oyster spat produced from the experimental hatchery of the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory at Point Cadet, Biloxi, Mississippi, were grown under a variety of conditions. Recovery of spat planted on adjacent bay bottom was negligible, despite the use of either whole oyster valves, crushed oyster shell or clam shell as a substrate. Negligible growth occurred for spat held in vertical and horizontal water tanks. Growth of spat in horizontal tanks was affected by the density of stocking, with lower densities producing faster growth. Growth in all studies was slower than anticipated and a comparison on growth for spat from a Maryland hatchery with locally-produced spat suggests that the low growth was related to the local waters. Overall, growth as determined by increase in greatest shell dimensions of spat is as follows: on-bottom, 2.90 mm/mo; raft culture., 1.78 mm/mo; upwelling tank, 1.19 mm/mo; and horizontal trough, 2.0 mm/mo.

Excorallana delaneyi is most similar to E. berbicensis Boone, 1918 described from Brazil, but it can be distinguished from that species and other members of the genus by the shape and spination of the uropods and pleotelson. A key is presented to separate E. delaneyi and the other seven species of Excorallana that lack lateral notches in the pleotelson. Morphological differences between the subadults and adults of E. delaneyi are described, and possible taxonomic problems resulting from such differences in other members of the genus are discussed. Based on field observations and known life history patterns for some members of the genus Excorallana, we consider E. delaneyi to be an intermittent fish parasite which lives and reproduces in a sponge domicile between feedings.

N2  - Hermit crabs, the gastropod shells that they inhabit, and associated epifauna constitute a motile microhabitat. Twenty-three macroscopic. epifaunal invertebrates were associated with the diogenid crab Clibanarius vittatus in Mississippi coastal waters. Epibiotic growth may discourage predation of the crab, reduce competition for the shells, or provide an advantage in agonistic shell interaction. In addition, the shell provides a hard substrate for settling and attachment of epifauna in an area that is largely devoid of hard substrate. Reduced sedimentation and prevention of shell burial, improved food availability, transport, and protection from predation may also be advantageous to the epizoans.

N2  - Between April 1987 and April 1990, 45 species of marine isopods were collected from intertidal and subtidal habitats in the vicinity of Pine Cay, Turks and Caicos, British West Indies. Five species, Licranthura tuberculata, Mesanthura spongicola, Califanthura minuta, Stenetrium caicoensis, and Armadilloniscus stepus, are known currently only from the northeastern Turks and Caicos Islands. The Turks and Caicos collections represent considerable range extensions for many of the species collected. Four species, Apanthura cracenta, Mesanthura punctillata, Carpias triton, and Munna petronastes, known previously from the east coast of Central America (Belize), are reported for the first time since their description. This report also presents the first published records from outside of their respective type localities for Amakusanthura significa, Mexicope kensleyi, Carpias brachydactylus, Carpias serricaudus, Uromunna caribea, Stenetrium monocule, and Stenobermuda acutirostrata. The other species reported, mostly flabelliferans, appear to be widely distributed in the tropical westem North Atlantic and their occurrence in the Turks and Caicos was not unexpected.

They (and two related species from the open Atlantic coast of North America) are removed from the genus Talorchestia Dana 1853, and placed in a new genus, Americorchestia. Americorchestia salomani, new species, and A. heardi, new species, occur from northwestern Florida to the Mississippi Delta. They are morphological counterparts of the well-known sandhoppers from the open Atlantic coast, A. megalophthalma (Bate) and A. longicornis (Say) respectively. Americorchestia barbarae, new species, related to A. salomani, occurs on open beaches west of the Mississippi Delta. Sandhopper species of the Gulf coast are smaller, have different food resources available to them, and are exposed to different physical and biological survival factors than their counterparts from the North Atlantic coastal region

N2  - Ovarian maturation and spawning of Penaeus vannamei was accomplished in a 120 l (30 gal) tank as well as in a 800 l recirculating system consisting of six aquaria plumbed into a common biofilter. Pond reared animals stocked one per tank were fed a diet consisting of commercial pellets, squid, and bloodworms. Temperature was maintained at 28oC and salinity between 28 and 32 ppt. Presence of black shields between aquaria, males, eggs in the water, and other females in the aquaria were not required for ovarian maturation. Thirty-six of 78 females held in the small talk system spawned. The smallest female which spawned was 25.9 g. After unilateral eyestalk ablation by enucleation, female P. vannamei molted in 3-16 days and spawned in 7-20 days. Up to four spawns occurred before the next molt which occurred 15-35 days after ablation.

N2  - Captive maturation and reproduction of Penaeus vannamei, a popularly cultured penaeid shrimp, was first achieved in 1977. Based upon interviews of 18 facility managers, average conditions are as follows: tank diameter of 4.6 m (15 ft), 100% water exchange with recirculation, temperature 27-29°C. salinity 28-32 ppt, and a photoperiod of 13-14 hours of light. Broodstock are predominately wild, undergo unilateral eyestalk ablation by enuculation, and are stocked at five per square meter with a 1:1 sex ratio. Penaeus vannamei at most facilities are fed squid, pellets and bloodworms four times daily and 3-7% of the females are found to be mated per night and 50% of the eggs are expected to hatch. Most facility managers anticipate some misplaced and some melanization of smmataphores.

We describe its pattem and coloration in life. Published reports of distribution and host acceptance by P. rathbunae and three of its congeners (P. anthophilus Holthuis and Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1964; P. pedersoni Chace, 1958; and P. yucatanicus Ives, 1891) are reviewed. The last two species are recorded for the first time from the Turks and Caicos, and the association of P. yucatanicus with Stichodactyla helianthus on the Caicos Bank is a new host record. Finally, we offer the first direct evidence that P. yucatanicus leaves the host anemone temporarily to "clean" fishes, discounting a previous suggestion of its role as a noncleaning mimic of P. pedersoni.

A total of 554 juvenile striped bass were collected during the study. Hydrographic data and stomach analyses indicate that neither water conditions nor food was a limiting factor to juvenile striped bass survival. Appearance of juveniles subsequent to the stocking of Atlantic coast fry and fingerlings coupled with lateral line scale count data indicate that all juveniles collected were of Atlantic coast origin, originating from stocked fry and fingerlings.

N2  - The Mississippi/Alabama continental shelf and associated coastal waters together form a complex ecological system of interrelated parts. The biological system of the area has become established during the period of sea level rise following the last continental glacial maximum about 18,000 years ago. Contemporary biological populations of the inshore waters are subject to episodic catastrophic events caused by exceptional cold fronts, flooding, major storms, hypoxia, red tide outbreaks, and major droughts. Most of these events are not known to affect the shelf populations directly, but indirect effects through food chain disruptions are likely. Loop Current intrusions and entrainment of deep Gulf waters could directly impact the shelf species. Imposed upon these events are various human intrusions which have severely reduced the quality and quantity of inshore habitats. Increase in commercial and recreational fishing pressure in the inside waters and on the continental shelf during the past two decades has been accompanied by dramatic decline in populations of demersal and pelagic fish species. In order to be able to manage resources of the area successfully, there is an urgent need to understand the natural functioning of the entire complex ecological system.

N2  - Adult specimens of the spot, Leiostomus xanthurus, were collected from bayou, Mississippi Sound, and barrier island locations along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi from November 1982 to July 1989. The mean total length of all spot sampled in comparable gill net sets was 219 mm (± 14 standard deviation, n=4,338). Ninety-five percent of the spot were collected in the island and sound areas, where the salinity was higher than in the bayous. Catch per unit effort was high at island and sound stations in spring and autumn, with relatively few fish caught during the winter spawning season and summer. The relatively high frequency of spot observed at the island stations in the autumn was probably influenced by spawning migrations, and the high spring values may repesent a combination of two abundant year classes. The two greatest yearly collections, in 1983 and 1986, may have been influenced by sampling conditions or by environmental conditions favorable to survival either during those years or earlier when those fish were postlarvae. The smallest yearly catch occurred in 1985 and may have reflected the harsh weather conditions that year.

N2  - Paraonis fulgens and Paraonis pygoenigmatica inhabit sandy littoral and sublittoral sediments of the northem Gulf of Mexico and U.S. East Coast, but seldom overlap in distribution. The purpose of this study was to compare the feeding ecology and distribution of these species. We analyzed distributions and gut contents of Gulf of Mexico specimens and found that P. fulgens inhabited substrates with slightly more silt and clay than those inhabited by P. pygoenigmatica. Although Paraonis fulgens ingested more diatoms than P. pygoenigmatica, this distinction likely resulted from habitat differences, not selective feeding. Previous studies suggested that P. fulgens fed selectively on diatoms only.

The second system utilized both physical and chemical filtration, but no biological filtration. The third system used a combination of biological, physical, and chemical filtration. Shrimp growth was monitored for a 12-week period for each system. Shrimp from the biological filtration system had a growth rate of 0.82 g/wk and an overall survival rate of 45.6%. Shrimp from the closed system which used physical and chemical filtration had a growth rate of 0.99 g/wk and a survival rate of 29.2%. In the third system which combined both types of filtration, the shrimp growth rate averaged 0.65 g/wk and the survival rate was 56.9%.

N2  - Eight and 22-day-old Penaeus vannamei postlarvae were exposed to several salinities for 24 hours and 120 hours by direct transfer from 32 ppt salinity to lower salinity waters. The challenge study included six experiments conducted on 8-day-old postlarvae (PL-8) and five experiments conducted on 22-day-old postlarvae (PL-22). Each experiment consisted of ten replicates of ten animals each. Shrimp were held in 1 L plastic containers with 500-ml of seawater. Lowered salinity resulted in lower survival for shrimp of both ages. Longer exposure time resulted in lower survival for shrimp of both ages. Younger shrimp exhibited lower survival than older shrimp. Survival of 8-day-old postlarvae after 24-hour exposure to salinities of 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 ppt was 97.3%, 92.8%, 19.8%, 8.2% and 1.7%, respectlvely. Survival of 22-day-old postlarvae after 24-hour exposure was 99.2%, 97.8%, 83.8%, 63.4% and 40.2%, respectively. A second series of experiments investigated the effect of salinity upon growth of 22-day-old postlarvae which had been acclimated to four different salinities (16, 8, 4, and 2 ppt). Thirty shrimp were stocked in triplicate into 113 L (30 gal) aquaria and fed a prepared commercial feed. Growth was determined after 30 days at 16oC and 28-30oC. Growth was greatest at higher temperatures, but statistically significant differences due to salinity were not detectable. Nonetheless, best observed growth occurred at the intermediate salinities of 8 and 4 ppt.

N2  - This note reports the average size of Penaeus vannamei postlarvae held under a variety of conditions for approximately 30 days. Fifteen separate and independent rearing trials were completed over several seasons. Extreme growth variations were noted, with significant differences existing in eight of the 26 replicates. Significant differences were noted for treatments in seven of the 12 studies. Shrimp ranged in size from an average of 0.01 to 3.08 g after a month of culture.

N2  - Penaeus setiferus were matured and spawned in a small 120L tank system in the absence of males. No significant differences in the number of shrimp that spawned or the time required to spawn were detected for shrimp held at salinities of 20, 25 or 30 ppt in either natural or artificial seawater. The earliest that spawning occurred was an average of 17 days past ablation and as late as 28 days past ablation. None of the shrimp held in artificial seawater at 20 and 25 ppt spawned in the same molt cycle in which they were ablated, while one third of the shrimp held in natural seawater did.

N2  - The endoskeleton of the calanoid copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, and its muscle attachments were described by Lowe (1935). She reported that the endoskeleton in C. finmarchicus consists of two tendinous endosternites and chitinous exoskeletal ingrowths to which muscles are attached. Howse (1960) noted attachments of the main muscles of the thorax to the exoskeleton in Acartia tonsa. Bouligand (1962) described the ultrastructure of muscle attachments to cuticle in three species of freshwater copepods of the genus Cyclops. Raymont et al. (1974) described the fine structure of muscle attachments to cuticle in C. finmarchicus. Information of the internal anatomy of marine copepods remains sparse. Therefore, we thought it worthwhile to focus our observations on the attachments of muscle to exoskeletal ingrowths in A. tonsa.

N2  - A major environmental concern about Lake Pontchartrain is an assumed long-term increase in turbidity based on Secchi disk transparency observations. Regression of the available data on Secchi disk transparency versus time (1953 through 1990) reveals a statistically significant decrease in transparency of about 40%. However, the data set is biased in that it does not adequately represent the seasonal effects of salinity and wind speed. Two analytical procedures were undertaken to determine the extent to which the apparent long-term decrease in transparency was dependent on the seasonal bias. One procedure involved seasonal adjustment of the data for the effects of salinity and wind speed. The other procedure was to remove the seasonal bias by constructing unbiased data sets. Seasonal adjustment for the effects of salinity and wind speed reduced the level of significance for the relationship between Secchi disk transparency and time from about 1% to about 10%. This result indicates that some of the apparent decrease in transparency in the original data is the result of inadequate representation of seasonal effects in the biased data set. In most years data are not available for all months with the result that the seasonal effects of salinity and wind speed are not adequately represented. When the bias was removed by constructing unbiased data sets, the data no longer supported the conclusion of a statistically significant change in Secchi disk transparency from 1953 to 1990; p > 0.5.

N2  - The morphology of the aberrant nereidid Namalycastis abiuma, Namanereidinae is described on the basis of material collected 1971-72 and 1976 in the brackish water drainage ditch system of Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA. The systematics of the species is briefly reviewed. The habitat and ecological conditions under which the species lives in these brackish ditches are described. At various times, N. abiuma lives out of water under the bark of trunks and branches of fallen trees. Decaying wood is ingested. It is suggested that future studies should concentrate on the reproductive biology of the widely spread, mainly tropical populations of what may prove to be not one, but several species of Namalycastis. A list of the invertebrate fauna associated with N. abiuma is included with notes on these associates.

N2  - Feeding and other dominant activities of Blue-winged Teal (BWT, Anas discors) and Green-winged Teal (GWT, Anas crecca) were compared from October 1987 to March 1988 in southwestern Louisiana, USA. Three observation towers were constructed near similar intermediate marsh habitats in areas where BWT and GWT concentrated for feeding. These observation towers allowed activities of the two species to be compared throughout the nonbreeding season. Although BWT and GWT often fed together, time spent in various activities differed. Feeding was the most frequent activity of both BWT(64.5%) and GWT (55.3%), but BWT spent more time feeding (P < 0.01) and alert (P < 0.05), but spent less (P < 0.01) time resting than GWT. Within each species there were differences in activity budgets among daily time blocks and among months, but few differences among the three habitats studied. Temperature and light intensity were correlated with resting (+), feeding (-), locomotion (-), and preening (+). Daily and monthly activity budgets of BWT and GWT were similar, as were ingested foods, suggesting that these two species used the study areas primarily for foraging, and left the areas for other activities. Predation and diminished resources during late winter may have affected activities of BWT and GWT as well.

N2  - Ten individual fish of two estuarine species, spot (Leiostomus xanthurus) and striped mullet (Mugil cephalus), were analyzed for fatty acids. Fish of similar size were obtained from a single collection to minimize variability due to age, size, location and season. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of each fatty acid provided statistically similar groups for each acid that existed among individual fish. Fatty acids in the striped mullet provided a greater number of statistically similar groups than those in spot, indicating greater variability among individual striped mullet, which probably reflected a greater diversity in the feeding regime for this species. ANOVA results within classes of fatty acids of both species indicated greater diversity in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated than saturated fatty acids. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) showed more individual variability in both species than did docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Dietary lipids and metabolic needs of the two species are distinct and may be the key factors in explaining individual differences observed in these two fish species.

N2  - A long-term data set compiled from our studies and a variety of investigations was analyzed to determine the effects of nine years of discharged brine (concentrated salt water) on benthic organisms surrounding a brine diffuser off Cameron, Louisiana (USA). These investigations began three months before brine discharge was initiated in 1981. A preliminary summary by Giammona and Darnell (1990) relied on just three years of discharge data and gave misleading reports of brine impacts. Brine effects over the nine years of study were minimal, in part because the fine sediments of the study area were numerically dominated by opportunistic species. mostly estuarine taxa, that showed dramatic population fluctuations both spatially and temporally. These fluctuations in benthic densities were the most salient characteristic of the study area. They resulted from summer hypoxia and anoxia in bottom waters, not from brine. The hypoxia was related to Mississippi River discharge and subsequent salinity stratification. Hypoxia eliminated some taxa and severely reduced populations of most benthic species. The only significant differences between communities near the diffuser and those outside the influence of its discharged brine resulted from water-column mixing by the discharged brine, which oxygenated waters around the diffuser and stabilized the salinity of bottom water at the stations near the diffuser. This enhanced benthic diversity around the diffuser and resulted in greater populations during some seasons.

N2  - The sheepshead minnow, Cyprinodon variegatus, is a widely distributed small fish species that inhabits estuaries and inshore waters from New England to northern South America. This species has been used extensively in aquatic environmental toxicity and carcinogenicity tests (Couch et al., 1981; Courtney and Couch, 1984). Hepatic neoplasms have been induced in the sheepshead minnow by exposure to several known chemical carcinogens including diethylnitrosamine (Couch and Courtney, 1987), methylazoxymethanolacetate (Hawkins etal., 1985), and dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (Hawkins et al., 1991). Because of its widespread distribution, limited home range, and proven sensitivity tocarcinogens, the sheepshead minnow appears to be a good candidate to serve as an in situ monitor of environmental carcinogens and other toxicants in coastal waters, especially those of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. To establish background information on the histopathological lesions in sheepshead minnows taken from the wild, we collected and examined specimens from an offshore site presumed to be free of chemical contamination. The present report concerns a hepatic neoplastic lesion, diagnosed as a hepatocellular adenoma, found in a wild sheepshead minnow. Neoplasms from wild sheepshead minnows or spontaneous neoplasms from laboratory specimens previously have not been reported.

N2  - Harvest potential, relative abundance, and geographic and bathymetric distribution are discussed for the red crab, Chaceon quinquedens, in the northcentral Gulf of Mexico. Harvest potential is expressed as the number of trapable crabs present on fishing grounds defined as depths ranging from 677 m to 1043 m between 87.5o and 88.5oW longitude. Using various estimates of the effective fishing area (EFA) of a trap, the number of trapable red crabs on the fishing grounds ranged from 3.7 x 106 to 10.7 x 106. Estimatesofcrabnumberssuggest there is a potential for commercial harvest in the northcentral Gulf of Mexico, east of the Mississippi River. However, fishery development must take into consideration the preponderance of females on the defined fishing grounds (MF ratio = 1:2.1) and the high incidence of ovigerous females (~20%) during much of the year. Females generally dominated at all depth strata, but the proportion of males to females increased with depth. Reduced numbers of red crabs were collected off the western Louisiana coast and a shift in depth distribution was found. Minimum upper depth limit for red crabs west of the Mississippi River was 860 m as compared to 677 m east of the River. The known range of C. fenneri is extended to 92o12"W longitude.

N2  - The softshell clam, Mya arenaria Linné, 1758, is reported from Georgia (USA) estuarine habitats based on studies conducted between 1969 and 1972. Observations on Georgia estuarine habitats where extant populations of softshell clams occurred are described. On several occasions, fresh shells with periostracum and tissue remnants were found in a brackish drainage system on Sapelo Island. These shells represent the first southern records of extant populations of softshell clams from such a specialized habitat type. Living specimens of M. arenaria from the benthos and specimens in the stomach contents of stingrays (Dasyatis sabina) were collected at four stations during 1969 in the North and South Newport Rivers. mesohaline tidal systems forming part of the southern and northern headwaters of St. Catherines and Sapelo Sounds.The stomach of a stingray collected near the mouth of Little Ogeeche River during another study also contained specimens of M. arenaria. Ephemeral, intertidal, winter populations of juvenile softshell clams are reported from exposed Pleistocene beach faces along tidal rivers in Chatham, Georgia. The associated fauna collected with softshell clams and occurrence of other cold temperate and boreal species from Georgia estuaries are discussed. The distribution of M. arenaria appears to be mainly limited by a critical maximum temperature of 28º. The relatively cooler summer temperatures observed at the Sapelo Island tidal ditch site may enable the species to survive in this restricted habitat. Data from the present study indicate that during winter and spring, softshell clams appear to be bionomically important components of the benthos and the diet of stingrays in some Georgia estuarine habitats. Whether or not reproducing populations of M. arenaria occur year-round in Georgia estuaries still remains an open question.

N2  - Levinseniella (Austromicrophallus) deblocki, n. sp., was collected during parasitologic studies of homeothermic vertebrates from salt marshes along the coast of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Because L. deblocki lacks a femal epouch, it belongs to the subgenus Monarrhenos proposed by Deblock and Pearson (1970). However, since Deblock and Pearson did not explicitly designate a type species for Monarrhenos, it is not available and is a nomen nudum. The next available name, Austormicrophallus Szidat, 1964, a genus synonymized with Levinseniella Stiles and Hassall, 1901 by Deblock (1978), is reinstated as a subgenus to receive the species lacking a female pouch and previously assigned to Monarrhenos. The adult of L. deblocki is found in the lower digestive tracts of the clapper rail (Rallus longirostris), rice rat (Oryzomys palustris), and raccoon (Procyon lotor). Morphologically, L. deblocki appears to be most similar to L. polydactyla Deblock and Rose, 1962, known from Europe, and L. ophidea (Nicol, Dameree, and Wootton, 1985), described from a freshwater habitat in California. Differences in the life cycle, habitat type, and geographic distribution, plus a combination of distinctive morphological characters (presence of lappets on the oral sucker, number of genital pockets, and body size) separate L. deblocki from the other members of the subgenus Austromicrophallus. The metacercarial stage of L. deblocki occurs in the gonads of fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) and the fist intermediate host appears to be a hydrobud gastropod (Heleobops sp.). Observations on living and preserved specimens fixed in copula indicate that the genital atrium functions as an eversible hermaphroditic organ bearing the male papillae and metraterm. The genital hooks or “Jägersköld’s bodies” appear to function as holdfast structures during copulation.

N2  - Pseudione overstreeti, new species, is a common bopyrid that infests the branchial chamber of the beach ghost shrimp, Callichirus islagrande, occurring along beaches of the Gulf of Mexico from Cape San Blas, Florida to Paraiso, Tabasco, Mexico. Like other members of the genus Pseudione that infest callianassid shrimps, the female of P. overstreeti is characterized by biramous terminal appendages which result from the combination of uniramous uropods with the closely associated lateral plates of pleomere 6. From the other members of the genus Pseudione occurring on callianassid hosts, P. overstreeti is distinguished by the distinctive development of the coxal and lateral plates on the female and the presence of elongate, posterolateral processes (= uropods by previous usage) on pleomere 6 of the male. Pseudione overstreeti is the second bopyrid from a callianassid host in the northeast Atlantic. The other species, Ione thompsoni Richardson, 1904, described from New England waters, infests the branchial chamber of Gilvossius setimanus (DeKay, 1844).

N2  - Trophic structure of estuarine benthic communities in the northern Gulf of Mexico was characterized according to the functional roles and geographic distributions of the macrobenthos. Macrobenthic organisms collected during two years of study were assigned to trophic groups to assess the relative utilization of detritus and other resources. Three groups of detritivores (surface-deposit feeders, subsurface-deposit feeders, and filter feeders) were numerically dominant among the benthos, each of which accounted for 25-30% of total abundance across regions. Carnivorous macrobenthos also comprised an appreciable portion (12%), while omnivores (<3%) and other groups (<4%) were poorly represented. Dominance by detritivores is consistent with current concepts regarding the role of macrobenthos in processing detritus of Gulf of Mexico estuaries.

N2  - A one-year distribution and abundance study on the bay anchovy, Anchoa mitchilli, was conducted in a southeast Texas marsh-lake system from March 1990 through February 1991. Day and night collections were conducted in backwaters, lake shores, and lake centers by seining and trawling. Bay anchovies were the second most abundant fish species collected, and exhibited seasonal, diet and habitat variations in abundance and distribution. Across the study area, seasonal abundance peaks occurred in May and August following migration into the marsh and seasonal recruitment. However, within each habitat type, peaks of abundance varied in time of occurrence. Within habitats, significant differences in the mean number of anchovies occurred such that backwaters in the daytime had the greatest number followed by backwaters at night, lake shores in the daytime, and lake shores at night. Lake center collections showed no significant diel pattern. The presence of vegetation was associated with reduced anchovy numbers; however, when present, anchovies were significantly more abundant in the daytime than at night.

N2  - The hatch rate of Penaeus vannamei eggs spawned by individual females in square and round tanks and in different volumes of seawater was determined. The mean hatch rates ranged from 17.3% to 64.9% and were not significantly different for volumes of 50, 100 and 200 L nor for square or round tanks of equal water volumes. Hatch rate was significantly affected by the size of the spawning tank.

N2  - Eghty-three mated Penaeus vannamei females were sourced from a commercial sized maturation tank. The hatch rate was recorded for those shrimp based on the presence of a full spermatophore, a partial spermatophore or the loss of the spermatophore during sourcing and handling. The hatch rates were not significantly different among females for the three spermatophore conditions. The mean hatch rates were 48.8% for full spermatophores, 43.1% for partial spermatophores and 55.6% for lost spermatophores. The location of the sperm at fertilization and the precise mechanisms of fertilization are still unknown.

N2  - This study describes the gametogenic cycle of the Atlantic surf clam, Spisula solidissima (Dillwyn, 1817), cultured from fall to spring in the coastal waters of Georgia, where it is non-native. Early active stages of gametogenic development began in November, with the majority (83%) of the animals in the early active stage by December. Gonadal indices increased to late active stages by March, with ripe individuals present in April. Spawning commenced in May and continued into June. Sex ratio (0.48 female to 1.00 male) was significantly unequal. Results of this study indicate that clams achieved sexual maturity and spawned when cultured in the coastal waters of Georgia. An aquacultural enterprise in Georgia could obtain broodstock for the production of the following fall&#039;s seed crop from the prior year&#039;s growout field planted clams before their spring harvest.

N2  - A pugheaded cobia (Rachycentron canadum) captured in the northcentral Gulf of Mexico represents the first record of pugheadedness in cobia. The specimen, a 4-year-old gravid female, exhibited considerable distortion of the premaxillary and maxillary bones, with the length of the snout 46% shorter than that of a normal cobia of the same length. The anomaly had no apparent effect on feeding, since the stomach contained a substantial amount of food, and the fish was the same length expected of a normal 4-year-old cobia.

N2  - Gonadal maturation of cobia, Rachycentron canadum, was evaluated by examining 508 specimens from its recreational fishery. Specimens were collected off southeast Louisiana to northwest Florida by hook-and-line during February through October 1987-1991. Fork lengths (FL) of these fish ranged from 580-1,530 mm, with corresponding weights of 2.0-43.5 kg. The female:male ratio was 1:0.37. Using a combination of oocyte size frequency and histological assessment of many of the fish, we determined that females were ripe from May through September, with atretic oocytes occurring in some fish from July through October. Degenerating hydrated oocytes in July and October and the presence of resting ovaries in July suggest two major spawning periods; however, monthly gonosomatic indices peaking in May, followed by a steady decline, do not support that finding. Ovaries were placed into undeveloped, early developing, mid-developing , or late developing categories based upon oocyte size-frequency distributions. Developing ovaries had two or three modes of oocytes larger than 30 pm. Batch fecundity was estimated to be 2.6x106 to 1.91x108 oocytes, depending on the size of fish/ovaries. The smallest female with oocytes exhibiting vitellogenesis was 834 mm FL. This fish was 2 years old based its otolith evaluation. The smallest male with an abundance of spermatozoa in its testes was 640 mm FL and 1 year old based on otolith evaluation; smaller males were not examined. Females larger than 840 mm FL had vitellogenic oocytes in March and April. A few fish still had vitellogenic oocytes in early October, but none did by late October. When Gilson’s fluid was used to assess ovarian tissue, the fresh weight of the tissue was reduced by 20% after being stored for 3 months. The diameter of oocytes shrunk about 25% in Gilson’s fluid which was 11% less than those fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Tissue sections from specific individuals, each demonstrating a variety of different developmental stages, were similar regardless of whether they were obtained from the anterior, middle, or posterior portion of either ovary.

N2  - The stomach contents of 403 cobia, Rachycentron canadum, caught in the northcentral Gulf of Mexico recreational fishery from April through October of 1987-1990 were examined. Cobia ranged from 373-1,530 mm in fork length. Of the 403 stomachs, 287 (71.2%) contained at least one identifiable prey taxon. Crustaceans, consisting primarily of portunid crabs, were the predominant food. Crustaceans occurred in 79.1% of the stomachs and comprised 77.6% of the total number of identifiable prey. The second most important prey category was fish which was dominated by hardhead catfish, Arius felis, and eels. Fish occurred in 58.5% of the stomachs but only accounted for 20.3% of the total number of prey. The importance of fish as prey increased with increasing size (length) of cobia, with the largest size class of cobia (1,150-1,530 mm FL) showing the highest percent frequency occurrence of fish prey (84.4%). There were no significant differences between the diets of male and female cobia. Species composition of the diet indicated that cobia examined in this study were generalist carnivores in their feeding habits and fed primarily on benthic/epibenthic crustaceans and fishes. However, the occurrence of pelagic prey provided evidence of diversity in the foraging behavior of cobia. Feeding in cobia indicated their dependence upon prey availability rather than upon a few specific food organisms.

N2  - Life history patterns often respond to local environmental conditions. The seasonal migration pattern of the northern hogchoker has been described, but the southern subspecies rarely has been studied. To document the migratory movements and the habitat characteristics of the southern hogchoker, long-term survey data and specimens collected during 1993 were examined. Moderate depth (5.8-6.4 m), low water clarity (0-1.2 m), moderate oxygen concentration (4-9 ppm), and sand-mud substrata generally defined hogchoker habitats. Hogchoker habitats only showed seasonal shifts in temperature and salinity characteristics. Hogchokers were only collected in low salinity (0-2 ppt) waters during the winter, but exhibited three abundance peaks in relation to bottom salinity during the summer samples at 0, 5, and 18 ppt. The survey data and the data from the 1993 specimens support the hypothesis that southern hogchokers are following a migration pattern similar to that described for the northern subspecies.

N2  - The reproductive biology of Gobiosoma bosci collected from November 1986 to October 1987 in the McFaddin Wildlife Refuge in southeast Texas was studied by using morphometric data. Males achieved greater weights per unit length than females, and longevity was about 12 to 13 months. GSI values and mean monthly ovum diameters indicated that the breeding season ran from April to September, with a major activity peak in May and a minor peak in September. Significant differences in male and female standard lengths (SL), ovum diameter, and egg number existed for sexually mature specimens between the first and second peaks of reproductive activity. An egg versus length analysis produced a positive linear relationship. An accessory gonadal structure index (ASGI) was developed and revealed that maximal AGS development corresponded with the male GSI, but did not produce discernable peaks. Two reproductive strategies were followed and depended upon time of hatching and growth rate. Some individuals that hatched early in the breeding season grew rapidly and were capable of egg laying by August or September. Individuals hatched late in the breeding season delayed breeding until the following season.

N2  - Cryopreservation of fish sperm has applications in preserving genetic resources from stocks of endangered fishes, replenishing fisheries, reducing the number of males needed in hatchery situations, and allowing repeated spawning of specific males. As part of a larger study on artificial breeding of sciaenid fishes, we developed procedures for collection, handling, refrigerated storage, and cryopreservation of spotted seatrout sperm. Hanks&#039; balanced salt solution (HBSS) was used as an extender for collection and storage of sperm. Sperm motility in relation to graded concentrations of HBSS was used to determine the osmolality at which sperm were activated. Based on these findings, HBSS was prepared at 201 mOsm/kg as an extender for sperm storage. To determine if ions present in HBSS were involved in sperm activation, separate activating solutions were prepared by the addition of NaCl, CaCl2, KCl, Na2HPO4, or MgSO4 to aliquots of a stock glucose solution (185 mOsm/kg). The chemicals were added at the concentration of each found in 1-x HBSS. Only the glucose solution containing 8 g/l NaCl(424 mOsm/kg) produced activation of sperm. We also evaluated four chemicals as cyroprotectants: methanol, glycerol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and n,n-dimethyl acetamide. Two freezing rates were evaluated by placing samples at either of two heights within a nitrogen vapor shipping dewar. The highest post-thaw motilities were in 10% DMSO with an average retention of 60% of initial motility at the lower position in the dewar, and 37% at the upper position. A third freezing rate was produced using a computer-controlled freezer programmed for a rate of -45ºC/min, yielding a retention of initial motility of 31%. Our freezing and transport of cryopreserved sperm in shipping dewars demonstrate the utility of this procedure for field applications.

Only one species of Chaetognatha, Sagitta hispida Conant, was present and was more abundant at Cuenca Norte (total density 450.6 organisms/m3) than at Bojórquez (138.6 organisms/m3). The latter site is smaller, more physically isolated, and more environmentally stressed than the former. From monthly gonadal and length-frequency analyses of 1390 specimens, it was found that (1) total length significantly differed among four successive maturity stages, (2) juvenile and immature specimens occurred in greater numbers at Bojórquez. while more mature specimens comprised a greater percentage of individuals found at Cuenca Norte, and (3) individuals collected at Bojórquez, where slightly higher temperatures were recorded, were significantly smaller than those from Cuenca Norte. The latter two findings indicate that Sagitta hispida spawns at a higher frequency at Bojórquez, possibly due to the cumulative effect of higher temperature.

N2  - An index of biological sensitivity to changes in freshwater inflow was developed for 44 species in 22 Gulf of Mexico estuaries for adult and juvenile life stages of fishes and macroinvertebrates. The BioSalinity Index (BSI) provides an innovative approach to quantify estuary-specific sensitivity of organisms to changes in estuarine salinity regimes based upon our knowledge of species salinity habitat preferences, the availability of this preferred habitat, and the relative abundance and distribution of species in time and space. We found that a significant difference exists between adult and juvenile life stage sensitivity, with juveniles exhibiting a lower sensitivity to salinity changes than adults, and that a considerable disparity exists in species-specific sensitivities among Gulf estuaries. Likewise, when the full complement of 44 species-level BSIs are averaged, marked differences in assemblage-wide sensitivity are evident across estuaries. The availability of preferred salinity habitat had a greater influence on the BSI for estuarine species than did their relative abundance and temporal distribution. The BSI was applied by members of a 1995 Gulf of Mexico freshwater inflow workshop to identify a subset of estuaries which appear more sensitive to freshwater inflow changes and are candidates for further study.

N2  - Few of the dominant benthic taxa of the northern Gulf of Mexico feed directly on phytoplankton. Rather, most of them feed on near-bottom seston and detritus. This is in contrast to models for Chesapeake Bay and San Francisco Bay. We found that detritivores represented over 80% of the macrobenthic organisms and over 90% of the biomass in Gulf of Mexico estuaries. The paucity of benthos that consumed phytoplankton led us to hypothesize that macrobenthos in Gulf of Mexico estuaries had less effect on plankton communities than was documented in U.S. east coast and west coast estuaries, where benthic communities consumed much of the water-column production. We provided as evidence gut-contents analyses of dominant taxa, the feeding morphology of suspension feeders (especially clams), and the lack of vertical mixing or strong turbulent flow that is necessary for benthos to remove substantial portions of the phytoplankton.

The variance of residuals from regression, s2reg, ranged from 0.2032 for the 1978 year-class to 0.0075 for the 1992 year-class, and showed a significant (P = 0.0001) logarithmic decrease over the year-classes. This decline in variation among individuals was probably due to a a shift toward sex ratios dominated by one sex (females), improvements in rearing facilities, year-around control of seawater temperature which reduced disease incidence, improved diet, and reduced feeding levels. The relationship between w and scl (straight carapace length) was also described.

N2  - Observers monitored the explosive removal of oil and gas structures in the Gulf of Mexico to protect sea turtles and marine mammals from adverse impacts. More than 7,000 monitoring hours at 131 structure removals were conducted during 1993. Sixteen individual sea turtles were observed including 6 loggerheads, 1 Kemp&#039;s ridley, 1 green, and 8 unidentified sea turtles. Aerial surveys were approximately ten times more effective in observing sea turtles than day or night surface surveys.

N2  - An analysis of chaetognath species distribution and abundance from the Yucatan Shelf during May 1986 is presented. Zooplankton samples and associated hydrographic data were collected at 21 stations off the northern and northwestern coasts of the peninsula. Density data were classified and analyzed by calculating the Euclidian distance. In addition, the Importance Value of the species was obtained. Highest abundance (1000 to 5000 orgs./100m3) occurred in the northern and northwestern zones off the peninsula, while species richness was higher at oceanic stations farther offshore. The most abundant and frequent species were Sagitta enflata and S. bipunctata. The classification analysis based on the Euclidian distance showed three zones in the study area with different predominant species: (1) The northeast oceanic region of the Peninsula, with S. minima, S. serratodentata, S. enflata and S. bipunctata; (2) the west and northwest neritic region with S. enflata and (3) the near northeast and west coastal region with S. bipunctata.

N2  - Benthic crustaceans were collected monthly between 24 August 1985 and 20 September 1986 from tidal freshwater (TFW), oligohaline (OH) and mesohaline (MH) sites in Old Fort Bayou, a black-water tidal river of the Biloxi Bay estuary, Mississippi. Salinity varied seasonally and spatially and was primarily related to variations in rainfall during this study. Reduced rainfall after October 1985 resulted in the upstream movement of saline water and a concommitant shift in benthic crustaceans upstream with this change in the physical-chemical environment. This shift is supported by a significant positive concordance of ranks between salinity and relative abundance of Gammarus sp. A (Kendall&#039;s tau-c = 0.458 and Spearman&#039;s rs = 0.704, pG. mucromatus (Kendall&#039;s tau-c = 0.497 and Spearman&#039;s rs = 0.701, p G. bonnieroides (Kendall&#039;s tau-c = 0.201 and Spearman&#039;s rs = 0.381, p = 199) in the TFW site. At the OH site, there was a marginally significant concordance (Kendall&#039;s tau-c = 0.432 and Spearman&#039;s rs = 0.545, p = .053) between salinity and relative abundance of G. bonnieroides but not for the other two species. Riverine estuarines are by nature dynamic in their physical-chemical environment. Such variation influences macrobenthic distribution which has important trophic implications because these organisms form a large portion of the food base for higher trophic levels, such as fishes.

N2  - Several fishes of the halfbeak genus Hyporhamphus occurring in the Mexican Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea have been misidentified or confused in the literature. Most of it has centered around the taxonomic status of H. unifasciatus (including its synonym H. roberti), which is shown to comprise a complex of three species, H. unifasciatus, the recently described H. meeki, from the western Atlantic region, and an undescribed species from the eastern Pacific Ocean. Another eastern Mexico halfbeak is the freshwater form H. mexicanus. Using Banford and Collette (1993), we examined specimens from collections at UANL, UNAM, IPN, and ECOCH and have clarified the Mexican distribution of these species. We here report additional Mexican records of H. meeki, previously known only from United States waters and from the coast of Yucatán, clarify the distribution of H. unifasciatus, and provide the first marine record of the freshwater species H. mexicanus. A distribution map and keys for identification of the eastern Mexican species are provided.

Crassostrea virginica were collected from nine reefs in the Mississippi Sound in 1993 and analyzed for concentrations of butyltins: TBT, dibutyltin (DBT) and monobutyltin (MBT). TBT concentrations ranged from <2 to>20 ng(Sn)/g wet wt. Highest concentrations of butyltins were found at eastern Sound reefs near intense shipping and ship building activities with lowest concentrations found in the western Sound.

N2  - Results of monthly zooplankton sampling, carried out from December 1990 to November 1991, are compared from three localities in the Mexican Caribbean. Two stations, Bojórquez, and Cuenca Norte, represent partially enclosed areas of the Nichupté Lagoon System in the northeastern region of the Yucatán Peninsula; a third station was located in adjacent neritic waters. At the neritic station, temperature was lower, salinity was higher, and variations in the two parameters smaller as compared to the two lagoon stations. Zooplankton abundance ranged from 3585.5 org./m3 at the neritic station to 18,742.7 org./m3 at Cuenca Norte. Considering all animals collected, decapod larvae (39%), copepods (28.7%) and ophiopluteus-echinopluteus larvae (22.8%) made the bulk of the catch. A total of 47 copepod species were recorded, of these, 14 were found at Bojórquez, 12 at Cuenca Norte and 42 at the neritic station. Acartia tonsa dominated the copepod population assemblage at Bojórquez (94.4%) and made important contributions at Cuenca Norte (34.5%) and in the neritic station (24.5%). Paracalanus quasimodo was most abundant at Cuenca Norte (40.3%) and contributed 20.9% at the neritic station. It is suggested that both, the high capture of A. tonsa in Bojórquez and the dominance of P. quasimodo at Cuenca Norte, is probably related with two factors: the anthropogenically nutrient-enriched condition of Bojórquez lagoon and the relatively higher breeding frequency of the chaetognath Sagitta hispida in Bojórquez. The highest abundance of zooplankters occurred at the stations within the lagoonal system, and the highest number of copepod species was found at the neritic station, where more stable conditions prevailed.

N2  - Mass mortalities of the sooty eel, Bascanichthys bascanium, and the speckled worm eel, Myrophis punctatus, were observed in association with a fish kill which occurred the morning of 18 June 1994 on the south shore of Deer Island, a nearshore barrier island located off Biloxi, Mississippi. B. bascanium and M. punctatus, as well as other fishes, were found dead and dying near the shore in reddish-brown water and along a lengthy stretch of fringing sandy beach. Both species of eels are infrequently reported from Mississippi waters but were the most abundant fishes recorded from the kill. A visual census conducted along ~1.6 km of shoreline and partially submerged tidal flat estimated eel mortalities at 8,000 individuals. The presence of highly discolored water and the lethargic behavior displayed by live eels and other fishes at the site of the kill suggested the episode may have been related to a localized phytoplankton bloom.

There is an overlap of 73.2 to 83.0% in the diet of these two species. Bairdiella chrysoura (1.17-1.92 mm SL) fed primarily on juvenile pelecypods, crustacean nauplii, eggs of invertebrates, including gasteropods and copepods.

N2  - Horizontal starch gel electrophoresis was used to detect genetic variation at eight enzyme loci and five general protein loci in 11 populations of Polymesoda caroliniana from the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic coast of the U.S. Little variability was found between four of these populations along a salinity gradient in the Cape Fear Estuary, NC, and a regional trend was not observed in other populations along a latitudinal gradient. Heterogeneity analyses and dendrograms, both based on allele frequencies, suggest populations from the Gulf coast of Florida are genetically different from both a northern Gulf population (Mississippi) and Atlantic populations. The population from Mississippi was similar to populations from the Atlantic coast, all of which were similar. Heterozygosity in the 11 populations ranged between 8.11 and 28.0%, and the percentage of loci polymorphic between 37.5 and 71.4%. Populations conformed to Hardy-Weinberg expectations at greater than 95% of all loci assayed except glucose dehydrogenase, where only the populations from Fort Myers, FL, and Sapelo Island, GA, conformed to Hardy-Weinberg expectations. Electrophoretic pattems observed suggest P. caroliniana larvae are planktonic and effective at dispersal.

N2  - Burrowing and ventilation activities of infaunal organisms have been shown to affect geochemical processes in sediments and at the sediment-water interface. Although burrowing brittlestars are dominant in many benthic environments, their role in these processes is poorly known. We tested the effect of the amphiurid brittlestar, Microphiopholis gracillima, on the flux of lithium ion from the sediment to the overlying water by using sediment cores with false bottoms for continuous flow of a Li+1-seawater solution. Brittlestars at densities of 300 and 600 individuals m-2 caused a twofold increase in the rate that Li was transported through the sediment. Density of brittlestars appeared to have no effect on the flux of Li+1 from the sediment, indicating a possible threshold beyond which density increases do not influence fluxes of solute from the sediment.

N2  - A synchronous hermaphroditic striped mullet, Mugil cephalus, was captured offshore of Southwest Pass, Louisiana on 6 December 1996 during the commercial roe mullet fishery harvest. The fish measured 412 mm FL, weighed 824 g and was determined to be 4 years old by otolith analysis. Gross examination of the gonads revealed four lobes: right and left ovaries and right and left testis which represents a unique occurrence among hermaphroditic fish. All lobes ended in a common sperm duct/oviduct with the exception of the left ovary which had no oviduct. Both ovaries contained vitellogenic oocytes and both testis had freely running spermatozoa. Histological examination showed many oocytes undergoing final oocyte maturation, the presence of some post ovulatory follicles and lobules full of tailed spermatozoa. There was no evidence of the intermingling of sperm and oocytes within the gonad. The capture of this fish on the spawning grounds and the advanced stage of both ovarian and testicular development suggests spawning probably would involve the release of both oocytes and spermatozoa.

A total of 274 red drum (4.00 - 19.99 mm SL) and 205 Atlantic croaker (8.00 - 17.99 mm SL) were used for this analysis. Of the red drum stomachs examined, 8.4% were empty while 28.8% of Atlantic croaker stomachs contained no food. Major prey items identified for both species were calanoid copepods, harpacticoid copepods and mysid shrimp across all size classes. Ontogenetic trophic niche shifts were detected for red drum and Atlantic croaker. Type and quantity of food ingested by red drum were similar across all stations (Aransas Bay Station: 1H, 2T and 3H) examined. Atlantic croaker ingested the same types of prey at all stations, but contained varying quantities of food throughout the study area. In general, high dietary overlap was observed between red drum and Atlantic croaker with most overlap values (Schoener’s index) exceeding 70%.

N2  - A brief overview of the creation and growth of the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory, this article traces the institution’s history and its strong relationship with the Mississippi Academy of Sciences. The Mississippi Academy of Sciences officially dedicated the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory (GCRL) with the opening of the first summer session at Magnolia State Park in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, on August 28, 1947. Mississippians in scientific and educational circles had worked for two decades toward creating a research and educational laboratory focused on the state’s marine and coastal environments. The Academy’s priorities were scholarly research and education. Political leaders were interested in the potential for a direct effect on the economy of Mississippi. The evolution of that two-fold focus has created a unique institution that integrates scientific discovery with graduate, undergraduate and public education as well as with rapid and effective response to questions of public concern.

N2  - An analysis of Secchi disk transparency observations from 3 sites on the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway indicates that water clarity has increased at the north shore and mid-lake sites, but has not changed at the south shore site. Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality data from 1986 through 1995 were used in the analysis. Further analysis indicates that the increased transparency was not caused by changes in salinity or wind speed. The best explanation for the observed increase is the cessation of shell dredging in 1990.

N2  - The phototaxis by larvae of the grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio that hatched from embryos which were exposed to a single pulse concentration of diflubenzuron (DFB; Dimilin®) was quantified. Stage IV embryos (6-day-old) were exposed to 0.5 µg/L of DFB for 4 days followed by transfer into clean seawater for the rest of the incubation period. The photoresponses of light-adapted larvae from untreated embryos and embryos treated with 0.5 µg/L DFB were monitored from 1 day through 8 day post hatch for phototactic responses to 500 nm light. Larvae from untreated embryos exhibited strong positive phototaxis at high light intensities (3 x 10-2 and 3 x 10-1 Wm-2) but became negatively phototactic at lower light intensities (3 x 10-5 to 3 x 10-3 Wm-2). This phototactic pattern continued during the monitoring period. On the other hand, larvae from DFB-treated embryos exhibited altered phototaxis for the first 3 days. Alterations were especially evident on Day 1, as larvae were only negatively phototactic. By Day 4, these larvae reverted to the normal pattern of photoresponses shown by untreated larvae. These results indicated that the alterations in photoresponses of larvae caused by embryonic exposure to DFB are only transitory and can be corrected within 4 days of hatching if the larvae are exposed to water lacking DFB.

N2  - Callinectes rathbunae and CalIinectes sapidus in Alvarado Lagoon, Mexico, were sampled monthly for one year to determine the extent of parasitization by the rhizocephalan cirripede Loxothylacus texanus. Prevalence levels. host sex ratio, carapace width-weight variation, and distribution of the number of parasites among hosts were analyzed. Loxothylacus texanus was present almost exclusively in C. rathbunae with a mean prevalence of 7.58%, while less than 1% of all C. sapidus were parasitized. Callinectes rathbunae constitutes a new host record for this parasite. A study of infection revealed significant variation in prevalence and host size throughout the study period. The sex ratio of parasitized crabs differed from that of the total sample with mares being parasitized more often, and the comparison of carapace width-weight relationships revealed lower weights of parasitized crabs.

N2  - The species composition, distribution, and abundance of medusae collected during a 4-day plankton survey in a reef system of the Mexican Caribbean were studied. Highest mean medusae abundance was observed over the fore-reef zone and in daytime samples. Lowest abundances occurred in the reef lagoon and at dusk. Seventeen species were identified, with Liriope tetraphylla, Aglaura hemistoma, Cubaia aphrodite, and Sarsia prolifera being the most abundant. They belong to a group of medusae dominant along the world&#039;s second largest barrier reef. Cluster analysis revealed primary (fore-reef) and secondary (reef lagoon, channel) oceanic groups, showing the strong oceanic influence along and across the reef system. Day-to-day variation in the reef medusan community seemed relatively unimportant. The community structure of the reef medusa fauna appeared to be quite uniform despite the expected migratory behavior of these predators, tidal exchange across the reef, introduction of oceanic species, and time of day. The species composition was most closely related to that of the Campeche Bank and oceanic Caribbean waters. Dominance of oceanic medusae within the reef lagoon was attributed to the narrowness of the continental shelf and the mesoscale hydrological features of the zone.

N2  - Fourteen species of hermit crabs, belonging to 5 genera, were identified from 35 stations in Tampa Bay and adjacent continental shelf waters. Ninety-two samples were taken from the intertidal zone to 15 m with a variety of gear including dip nets, trawls, dredges, and hand collections using SCUBA. Pagurus maclaughlinae, Pagurus longicarpus, and Pagurus pollicaris were distributed throughout the bay. These species were often sympatric, and were commonly found in seagrass beds, sandy substrates, and sand/mud substrates, respectively. Clibanarius vittatus, Pagurus gymnodactylus, and Pagurus stimpsoni inhabited the higher salinity waters of the bay entrance. Paguristes sp., Paguristes hummi, Pagurus impressus and Petrochirus diogenes were collected from the lower bay to offshore on hard substrates and sand. Paguristes puncticeps, Paguristes sericeus and Pagurus carolinensis were collected only offshore on hard substrates. The latter species is reported from the Gulf of Mexico for the first time. Isocheles wurdemanni appears to be restricted to high energy beaches. An illustrated key as well as information on distribution, reproductive biology, taxonomic problems, symbionts, and coloration are presented.

N2  - Taxonomic analysis of the copepod specimens collected from 29 Cayman Island ponds revealed the presence of ten species including the nearly ubiquitous cyclopoid Apocyclops panamensis. This species was widespread throughout the islands, being collected at 27 of the sampling sites. Another common calanoid, Mastigodiaptomus nesus, occurred at nine sites on Grand Cayman and one on Cayman Brac. A cyclopoid of Afro-Asian origin, Mesocyclops ogunnus, was collected at two nearly fresh water sites on Grand Cayman and was considered to be a recent introduction. Because of its known adaptability to fluctuating environmental conditions, it is likely that M. ogunnus will successfully compete with and probably displace some of the native species and may become a dominant zooplankter on Grand Cayman.

N2  - Apostome ciliates are symbiotic organisms whose life cycles are complex and involve specific feeding, divisional, migratory, and phoretic stages. In this study we examined apostome trophonts (the diagnostic stage) from a variety of crustacean hosts in the Mobile Bay and Dauphin Island, Alabama, area. The hosts were grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio and P. paludosus), striped hermit crab (Clibanarius vittatus), blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), and pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus (=Penaeus) duorarum). A number of similar but distinct morphotypes of apostomes were present, those corresponding to descriptions of species of Hyalophysa as well as variant forms. The morphotypes observed in this study had the following characteristics: variations in the formation of the anterior ventral field of kinetosomes from falciform field 9; variations in the degree to which ciliary row 1 (kinety 1) was separated into 2 segments; and variations in the development of kinety a. A record of the variant morphotypes that do not correspond exactly to an established species should prove useful to biologists attempting to identify apostomes from crustacean molts. We choose not to name the variant forms as new species because they exist as different morphotypes within a population of cells, because some of these types occur in low frequency, and because one of the variant forms changes from one morphotype to another.

N2  - This atlas presents a comprehensive report on fishes collected in the St. Louis Bay drainage between October 1950 and October 1989, prior to several recent years of accelerated commercial and residential development. A total of 261 samples taken at 126 sites from headwaters of major streams to the mouth of St. Louis Bay resulted in the collection of 75,625 specimens representing 124 species plus 2 hybrid sunfish combinations. Precise locality data are given for each collection site, with number of species and specimens taken at each site, followed by a total list of species taken at each site. A distribution map is presented for each species. The legend on each map includes family name, scientific and common name of the species, number of collection sites, and total number of specimens collected. The geographical location of the St. Louis Bay drainage is briefly described, as are local physical, geological, and vegetational features. We believe this atlas will be a useful document to assess the environmental impacts of future economic development on aquatic communities in the area.
